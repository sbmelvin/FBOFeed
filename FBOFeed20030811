<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas, for the period September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004. The purpose of this action is to obtain professional services for the analysis, design and development of techniques for multi-spectral wavelet codec (compression/decompression) algorithms for digitized Cerigram images. The codec incorporates multi-spectral mapping for optimum color perception, multi-scale feature extraction, vector quantization codebook training and boundary mark detail-preserving residual scalar quantization. Texas Tech University is uniquely qualified for this work because of the expertise and experience of the principal investigator (Dr. Mitra) in the specific area of Hybrid Multi-scale Vector Quantization (HMVQ) design for compression/decompression of digitized spine x-rays, and its extension to digitized color cervix images combined with her extensive educational background and research experience in advanced image processing and numerous other technical publications, and the support of the facilities and staff of the Texas Tech Computer Vision and Image Analysis Laboratory (CVIAL). The co-principal investigator Dr. Brian Nutter’s strong background in image processing and designing network protocol provides complementary support to this work. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner in which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.

<DESC>This requirement is for non-personal consulting services of Stansell Consulting, LLC, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275 for recommendations on Tasks 1 - 4 of the proposal for impact assessment of a modernized L1C/A code to be broadcast in the future by the Global Positioning System.  This is for a project that will provide the basis for adding a modern signal onL1 that will have new levels of performance to all GPS users.  Adding modern signal to existing GPS is considered difficult because of the need for the L1 spectrum to stare with C/A-, P(Y)-, and M-Codes.  Working with representatives from the user community including international users, will define all impacts and benefits to the decision for development. This requirement results from award of Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB) Stewardship Funds.  Stansell Consulting is the only known source who possesses the background needed for full-spectrum decisions on recommendations for this program.  Stansell LLC led the technical development of the new GPS L1 civil signal and has on-going knowledge of the technical requirements for this multi-agency and multi-user determination.  No other source possesses the depth and breadth of GPS knowledge that is required for this effort.  Period of performance is 2 years.  No solicitation document exists and no solicitation will be issued.  Interested parties may submit their qualifications to the Contracting Officer for evaluation for future efforts, if any.

<SOLNBR>1435-01-03-RP-72318
<RESPDATE>082103

<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE SOLICITS ALL INTERESTED PARTIES FOR THE STUDY ENTITLED "TO CONDUCT NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES EVALUATIONS OF SUBMERGED SITES ON THE GULF OF MEXICO OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF", as described below.  INTRODUCTION:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, is charged with the responsibility of considering the effects of its actions on significant cultural resources on the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States, from State Waters to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  This program arose out of a variety of legislation enacted to ensure proper management and protection of the nation's cultural heritage.  The most pertinent of these laws are the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (as amended), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) of 1978.  In order to meet this responsibility, the MMS requires the oil and gas industry to conduct high-resolution remote sensing surveys in advance of any bottom-disturbing activities such as exploration drilling or pipeline construction and to submit an archaeological report analyzing these data.  Magnetic or acoustic remote sensing targets that display signal characteristics consistent with those observed with historic shipwrecks are flagged for avoidance by industry operations.  Only on rare occasions where avoidance is not feasible has Phase II testing been conducted on these targets.  As a result, the MMS has amassed little information regarding the identification of these anomalies, which could potentially be of value in both eliminating extraneous, archaeologically insignificant sites from further concern and in refining the analytical methods used in selecting certain sites for avoidance in the future.  Archaeological services are required for an indefinite quantity contract for the preparation of cultural resources surveys, compliance documents and consultation projects at various locations primarily offshore of the states of TX, LA, MS, AL, and FL.  This contract will provide program support in determining potential National Register eligibility of selected sites, the adequacy of current protective measures (i.e., avoidance criteria established for discovered remote sensing targets), compliance by industry with Government protective measures in areas where construction has already occurred, and in the preparation of related documentation. Specific objectives include, but are not limited to:  archival and historical research; archaeological/geomorphological remote sensing surveys; site testing/evaluation for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); special studies; conservation and laboratory analyses; technical reports; and preparation of National Register nomination forms.  This will be an indefinite quantity contract with issuance of negotiated, firm fixed-price, Task Orders.  It is estimated that approximately eight (8) sites will be investigated under this contract for National Register eligibility.  These sites consist of remote sensing (magnetometer, sidescan sonar, subbottom profiler) targets previously located during oil and gas industry pipeline and/or lease block surveys.  Coordinates of these targets are assumed to be accurate.  Testing sites will be selected by the government within the jurisdictional area of the Gulf of Mexico Region.  The sites will be selected in areas where water depth would not preclude the use of scientific divers (<130 FSW).  Use of a hand-deployed Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) may be appropriate for certain sites.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following factors:  Personnel Qualifications, Understanding and Technical Approach, Organizational Capability, Schedule of Rates, Past Performance, and Performance Management Plan.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors; therefore, offerors should provide their best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if later deemed by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The period of performance of the contract shall be sixty (60) months.  The total cost of all work orders shall not exceed $200,000.  Minimum guaranteed annual amount shall be $4,000 for the initial period of twelve (12) months. How To Respond:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform work by providing Capabilities Statements by 21 August 2003 detailing: (1) Your key personnel, scientific and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the project) with their qualifications  and specific expertise and experience.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of marine archaeology, history, sedimentology, and artifact conservation; (2) Your organization's experience with this type of work and a description of your facilities; and (3) Specific references (including project identifier/contract number and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name, and current telephone number) for work of this nature that your personnel or organization is currently performing or has completed within the last three (3) years.  Also, please include any negative references and your rebuttal explaining your side of the story.  Offerors shall submit an original and two (2) copies of the Capabilities Statement to: Michael Hargrove, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., MS 2510, Herndon, VA  20170-4817.  Seven (7) additional copies shall be submitted to Ms. Connie Landry, Minerals Management Service, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, MS 5431, New Orleans, Louisiana  70123-2394.  It is the responsibility of the Offeror to ensure that the Capabilities Statements are received by the dates and time set forth above.  Timeliness of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon, Virginia.  Your capabilities statement will be evaluated based on: (1) Past performance which includes: adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of previous products delivered, effectiveness of program management, and the Offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted by unexpected difficulties.  (2) The degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, including number, complexity, and size; (3) the experience and expertise of all scientific and technical Key Personnel.  Evaluation factors include the length and quality of experience for each person assigned to perform specific tasks, their experience and expertise in the fields applicable to the performance of this study. (4) Your Project Manager's demonstrated ability and experience with managing a research project and ability to control costs and to keep project performance and document preparation on schedule.  The Principal Investigator may serve as Project Manager.  Following Step (1) which is the review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements, only those determined from the evaluation factors described above to be most qualified to successfully perform the effort will be invited to Step (2) and provided a detailed Request for Proposal.  All offerors will be contacted after Step (1).  Offerors are strongly discouraged to use the telephone numbers submitted below to receive answers to their questions but written, E-mail or facsimile inquires are strongly encouraged.  Provide questions to michael.hargrove@mms.gov and paula.barksdale@mms.gov.  Please include RFP Number 73218, as well as your full name, organization name, address, phone and FAX numbers.

<DESC>In an effort to maintain and strengthen the United States expertise in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering disciplines the Office of Naval Research has established a National Naval Responsibility (NNR) for Naval Engineering (this includes both naval architecture and marine engineering). This NNR will help to ensure the presence of a strong Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering discipline in the United States for future generations of innovative ship design. 
The long-term goal of the NNR for Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Program initiative is the development of technology and the cultivation of resources that will enhance the ability to develop creative and innovative ship designs. This call for proposals is focused on Modeling and Optimization for Naval Engineering. In particular, the ONR is requesting proposals in the following three areas:
a) Computational Tools for Naval Design
Research is solicited that will advance computational tools for the naval design and acquisition community. Emphasis is on the development of techniques, algorithms, or computational kernels that can be transitioned to a design tool development effort. University/industry or University/Navy teams in which industry or Navy provides a perspective to focus the emerging technology are encouraged. Specific areas of interest are: 
o	modeling of
ƒ{	internal and external entrained fluid under shock
ƒ{	implosion
ƒ{	flow resistance, maneuvering, and seakeeping of novel hull forms
ƒ{	roll damping
ƒ{	hydrodynamic-flow/structure interaction
o	integrated analysis & optimization methods for structural mechanics,  acoustics, or hydrodynamics
o	error quantification and aggregation in metamodels
ƒ{	How can the accuracy of representation of each model, for which a metamodel is being utilized, be assessed?
ƒ{	Is it possible to assess the aggregate error involved in multidisciplinary modeling of a system of systems?
ƒ{	Are there guidelines that could be developed for error budgeting for the overall analysis?
o	significant speed-ups in modeling of:
ƒ{	generation of seaway loads and the resulting ship motion and stresses
ƒ{	acoustic and non-acoustic signatures

In addition, transition teams are sought to facilitate transitions in 
o	automated domain decomposition for large models, 
o	decision support tools for defining the appropriate level of geometric & mesh fidelity for a desired accuracy
b) Hull Optimization for Multi-Hull Vessels 
A method to optimize the design of high-speed, multi-hull ships is needed. This method will encompass powering, stability, seakeeping, structures, and payload capacity. Currently, the vast majority of U.S. naval ships are relatively large mono-hulls with limited speed requirements. The desire for high-speed transit capabilities has resulted in increased interest in the application of multi-hull platforms for naval missions.  Multi-hull ships have potential advantages over mono-hull ships in terms of larger deck area per ton of displacement, larger transverse stability, higher reserve buoyancy in case of hull penetration, and better seakeeping.  However, the design procedures for multi-hull ships are different from that for mono-hulled ships.  The multi-hull configuration typically requires a 3-D design approach, compared to many of the standard 2-D approximations performed for mono-hulls.  Additionally, with the Navy¡¦s current interest in higher speeds and, in many cases, smaller ships, optimization of multi-hulls requires concurrent consideration of powering performance, payload capacity, stability, and seakeeping.  An optimization process and algorithms need to be developed that can be utilized by early stage ship design synthesis models.  This capability should include:
o	Early stage structural design methods that utilize longitudinal, transverse and slamming loads across a range of speed parameters with a consideration for lifetime fatigue performance. 
o	Algorithms to address the impacts of wave-making interference relative to longitudinal and transverse spacing between hulls.  
o	 Optimization of 3-D hull form shape and size characteristics and relative location for multi-hull configurations based on powering performance, payload capacity, stability and seakeeping.
o	Refined and validated multi-hull seakeeping assessment tools.
c) Automated Functional Arrangements for Submarines and Surface Ships
Early stage arrangements of submarines and surface ships are a critical component to the successful design of new and innovative concepts.  Early stage designs have tended to initially concentrate on the geometric arrangement of a number of important weapons and propulsion systems since these have a critical impact on the arrangement of the remaining compartments.  After these major systems/compartments are located, surface ship arrangements have tended to concentrate the assumption that the provision of sufficient area or volume will support later detailed arrangement of equipment and compartments within the available space.  However, this assumption results in a loss of fidelity for designs developed to meet uniquely different missions.  In submarines, further arrangement definition is a necessity to insure the feasibility of the design to establish and maintain a neutrally buoyant condition.  Existing design synthesis programs can assist in defining the required design arrangement and characteristics.  However, for both submarines and surface ships, adequate arrangement detail dictates manual development of the arrangement design.  When radically new concepts are required, problems arise with respect to the time and expertise it takes to manually develop effective, consistent arrangement designs. 

A tool set is required to assist the designer by automating, to the maximum extent practical, early stage functional arrangements.  It is envisioned that this tool set would take the designers¡¦ initial layout of critical spaces (major weapons, machinery and other major space requirements) and then follow a set of rules that insure required functional adjacencies, as well as, personnel and cargo flow and access in the layout of the remaining space requirements.   Once a full functional arrangement is available, improved algorithms can be developed to predict service loads and distributive and other auxiliary system characteristics within compartments based on the functional role assigned to the compartment.  This tool set may function independently or be integrated with design synthesis tools.

<DESC>This sole source procurement action is for Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) equipment that will be used for new installations, replacements, upgrades and maintenance of equipment used for the control and monitoring of electrical power substations.  Western has spent considerable resources (estimated to be several thousand man hours) in developing the GE Energy Systems D20 RTU to work with our Supervisory Control And Data Aquisition (SCADA) system.  This has involved having multiple protocols enabled on a single chip set which allows the use of the multi-porting feature of these RTU?s.  Western has GE D20 RTU spare parts on hand and has received extensive training in the use and maintenance of the RTU?s.  Specific design packages and drawings have been developed for the D20 RTU to facilitate the fast and most economic means for fabrication of this equipment.  This equipment has proven to be very reliable and Western has been purchasing this equipment exclusively since 1985. The various modules and equipment procured will be used to fabricate or upgrade an GE Energy D20 RTU to the specific size and requirements for each individual application and will meet Westerns critical responsibility of providing control and data acquisition of electrical power substations as mandated by FERC and WECC.

<DESC>The FERC intends to acquire services on a sole source basis from: Stebbing & Associates, Inc., (SAI) Signal Mountain, TN 37377.  SAI will provide cryogenic and engineering services to the FERC’s Office of Energy Projects to evaluate the cryogenic design and operation of various Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities and to provide pre/post certification LNG reviews on an as needed basis.  Such studies determine overall system reliability as called for by Section 303 of the NGPA. System reliability must be assured to meet natural gas requirements for high priority uses during periods of peak demand for natural gas. This especially applies to the operational reliability of LNG facilities which are located close to markets for which there are no alternatives. SAI will assure that each facility complies with appropriate facility safety procedures and operations. Elements of the facility subject to the review are the land-based cryogenic requirements, including, but not limited to, the storage tanks, pretreatment and liquefaction, transfer lines, compressors, pumps, vaporizers, associated processes as they interact with the cryogenic components, hazard detection and control systems, and topographic features of the plant, such as dikes and impoundment areas. The reviews are also to cover the operation, maintenance, and emergency procedural philosophies for each facility. SAI will be responsible for conducting technical conferences with the applicants or operators and their Contractors, and for implementing site inspections. Based upon the studies, conferences, and site inspections, SAI, using FERC’s Cryogenic Design and Inspection Manual for each facility will prepare and submit to the FERC a Final Inspection Manual for each facility (including a summary report within the manual). The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1. The period of performance will be one year beginning October 1, 2003, with four one-year option periods.  The resultant contract will be fixed price.  It is estimated that eight inspections will take place per year.  Interested firms may forward their interest and capability to the referenced address within 15 days (August 26, 2003) after the date of publication of this Notice.  Capability forwarded will include and demonstrate that the interested firm has retained a lead engineer who has the background requirements of 15 years of recent cryogenic engineering experience, ten of which were related to LNG facilities. Interested firms must also provide evidence of its corporate experience within the last 5 years performing cryogenic engineering services on at least 5 LNG facilities. Interested firms must be thoroughly familiar with FERC’s Cryogenic Design and Inspection Manual. Please forward interest and capability to Charlotte Handley at charlotte.handley@ferc.gov.  Correct phone number is 202-502-8895. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by the response date will be considered by the FERC. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FERC. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. M. Baguant, Central Tender Board Office, 1st Floor, Social Security House, Moka Road, Rose Hill, Republic of Mauritius, Tel: (230) 465-9300, Fax: (230) 465-0068  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Mauritius Police Force (MPF). 

The Mauritius Police Force (MPF) seeks assistance with the upgrade and expansion of its non-encrypted, two-way trunk radio network. 

The MPF is struggling with out-of-date, incompatible radio communications and information system technologies.  MPF's primary radio network system was purchased in 1991 from the Dutch company Philips.  The MPF bought a limited personal radio system from Motorola in 1998 on a trial basis, but did not purchase the full $8-9 million system that would maximize the entire system's capabilities.   The MPF is considering purchasing an expanded Motorola system, but unfortunately lacks the on-staff expertise to determine whether it is compatible with the existing network. 
  
MPF plans to procure approximately $12-18 million in communications and information technology equipment and services per year over the next several years in order to improve organizational efficiencies and to provide better services to Mauritius.  Among the primary concerns are smuggling and elicit commercial transactions. 
 
The Technical Assistance will include evaluating the MPF’s current radio network systems, providing advice and recommendations as to what will be needed for upgrading this system, and preparing tender documents and analyses for future procurements.  Travel to Mauritius will be required.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $231,289 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a suggested budget are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 1:30 PM (LOCAL), September 22, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with ABC Radio Network, Dallas, Texas.
Purpose:
 To provide services and voice talent to develop, promote, and broadcast public service health messages to African Americans throughout the U.S.  Messages will focus on diabetes and obesity, critical health areas identified by Steps to a Healthier U.S., the HHS Disparities Initiative, and Healthy People 2010.  This procurement is being conducted by the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs on behalf of the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  

HHS has made eliminating health disparities affecting racial and ethnic minority 
   populations a critical goal of Healthy People 2010, the nation's public health agenda 
for the current decade.  Achievement of disparities objectives is also key to accomplishment of the President’s Healthier US agenda, the HHS Steps to a Healthier US program, and the HHS Disparities Initiative.  

To support this goal, HHS, the NIH National Institute for Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs seek to deliver scientifically valid and culturally appropriate health messages to each racial and ethnic minority community.  HHS and its components are seeking to deliver messages via commercial broadcast radio because national radio provides more spot availabilities for dollars spent.  ABC has a national reach of more than 31 million listeners each week.  Our nine week Take a Loved One to The Doctor Day PSAs will heard by nearly 311 million listeners across the U.S. and the cost per 1,000 listeners is under $3.00 for the total campaign.

ABC Radio Networks has demonstrated its interest in working in this area with HHS since 2001.  ABC Radio approached HHS regarding creation of a health campaign in early 2001.  Subsequently, HHS and ABC Radio launched the Closing the Health Gap campaign in December 2001 with donated broadcast time and promotional support from ABC.  HHS has not previously purchased broadcast time for this campaign with ABC Radio or any other any vendor.  

With more than 4,800 affiliate radio stations, ABC Radio reaches 158 million persons age 12 and older each week.  ABC Radio’s Urban has a major share of the African American radio market, being heard by 17 million African-Americans weekly.  Morning personality Tom Joyner is a major and trusted source of information in this market and the principal spokesperson for prior collaborations on health with HHS.  His The Tom Joyner Morning Show can be heard daily on 119 of 240 ABC Radio Urban Advantage Network affiliates and around the world on the American Forces Radio and Television Service. 

As part of the Health Gap campaign, Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day, now planned for the third Tuesday of each September, is the signature event of the Health Gap campaign. This year, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson has declared September 16th Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day.  The focus of the day is to encourage individuals to visit a health professional (a doctor, a nurse, a nurse practitioner, or another health provider), make an appointment for a visit, attend a health event in the community, or help a friend, neighbor, or family member do the same. HHS and its partners also encourage communities around the country to organize health events on this day. 

This year, HHS intends to seek broader distribution of its health messages in order to support the campaign and promote Take A Loved One to the Doctor Day events organized by community health centers and local organizing groups around the country.  It will use commercial broadcast time purchased for this purpose to promote Doctor Day and deliver 
health messages focused on prevention and early detection of disease as critical steps toward eliminating health disparities in African Americans and other minority communities.  HHS seeks to utilize ABC Radio channels to support its outreach to African American communities.
 THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center (EASC) is seeking sources to examine the socio-cultural processes and structures that support the collaborative responses to mitigating increased pressures on fisheries in the Northeast.  Assessment of the impacts of fisheries regulations on communities fall within the jurisdiction of the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). National Standard 8, one of ten standards for fishery conservation and management in the MSA, mandates that:  Conservation and management measures shall, consistent with the conservation requirements of this Act (including the prevention of overfishing and rebuilding of overfished stocks), take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities in order to (A) provide for the sustained participation of such communities, and (B) to the extent practicable, minimize adverse economic impacts on such communities   (16 U.S.C. 1851(2)(8)).  Additionally, NEPA obligates Federal agencies to consider the impacts of their actions on the human environment, such as fishing groups and communities.  The Northeast region has undergone and continues to face intense pressures on fishing activities due to depleting stocks and/or tightened management measures. Other pressures include land use changes and increased gentrification in areas traditionally utilized for fishing activities. Some groups have developed innovative strategies to contend with and/or adapt to these changes while others have not. Within the social science literature on fisheries, considerable work has pointed to the role of formal and informal institutions in managing the socio-cultural interface with natural resources (McCay and Acheson 1987, Acheson and Wilson 1996). At the same time, concerns have been raised about the conditions under which these institutions arise and the distribution of their benefits.  The identification of such processes and the conditions that enable them is thus an integral step towards supporting the conditions for sustainable coastal communities, a key element in building sustainable fisheries.  The goal of this procurement is to improve the current level of understanding of the factors that lead to successful collaborative responses to ecological, social and regulatory change in the Northeast.  Interested parties shall submit a request for the solicitation in writing to this office no later than August 25, 2003.  The applicable NAICS is 541720..  This action is estimated below the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00.  No contract award will be awarded based on responses to this notice as this notice is not a request for quotation or proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO RESPOND TO TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

QUESTION:

In your requirements, you are requesting a horizontal clearance of approximately 32 in.  My question is, will the tire be placed at the bottom of the test frame in its entirety.   Is it possible to place only a portion of the tire in the test frame during the test? Are there any test specifications you can forward to me, detailing the methods of your proposed testing?  

ANSWER:

The requirements for bicycles can be found in 16 CFR 1512 and the test manual for bicycles is available on the CPSC web site.  the rim test in section 5.12 applies a 2,000 n (450 lbf) load to the hub of the wheel with the tire supported fully by a “mask.”  As envisioned for the purpose of specifying this equipment, the tire shall be placed at the bottom of the test frame in its entirety.

The project officer can not answer the second part of question (is it possible to place only a portion of the tire in the test frame during the test?)  without seeing specific details on how the vendor proposes to meet the testing requirement outlined in 16 CFR 1512.

The Point of Contact for all information regarding this acquisition is Rose Heidenreich, Contract Specialist, at the address and phone number listed above.  The quotation package is due August 18, 2003, No change in response date.

<br>
<b>CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS and REPLIES:</b><br><br>
Q:  What is the feed water supply of the system?
<br>
Reply:  The system will be used to clarify seawater.
<br><br>
Q:  What is the end use of the water?
<br>
Reply:  RO system will be used to generate potable water.
<br><br>
Q:  What is the production requirement of the system?
<br>
Reply:  Each system will be run with four membranes, so will produce approximately 1,500 GPD.  Note that this production rate will be in Southeast Alaska waters, so the system should produce 1,500 GPD with a feed water temperature of about 43 degrees Fahrenheit.
<br><br>
Q:  What power supply/voltage configuration is available for the motors?<br>

Reply:  Available power is 240V, single phase.
<br><br>
Q:  Item 4 states "Provide 40” RO membranes..............." We assume that the membrane and pressure vessels are to be 2.5" x 40" which is the industry standard size for use with the pump specifications that you have provided. We also assume that the systems are for seawater use. No raw water data was provided in your RFQ. We would suggest that you specify this to prevent incorrect equipment being quoted or provided. RO systems and membranes are available for use in tapwater, brackish, and seawater. The tap and brackish systems are significantly less expensive but will not work in high salinity applications such as seawater.<br>

Reply:  This item calls for standard 2.5” x 40” membrane and pressure vessels.  The system will be used to desalinate seawater.
 <br><br>
Q:  Item 5 states "Provide 100’ hydraulic hose................" At end of this item, it states quantity 3. Does this mean you want 3 each 100 foot coils of hose? This seems like a lot for building three systems.
<br>
Reply:  Yes, this item calls for three (3) 100-foot lengths of hose, a total of 300 feet of hose.
<br><br>
Q:  Item 6 states "Provide all necessary swage-installed fittings..............." There are numerous swages and dies, etc. that require a hydraulic press to assemble. We generally prefer to use re-usable type fittings that are easily assembled in the field with basic hand tools. In the event of a hose failure, end can  be removed and re-attached. Is this okay to substitute?
<br>
Reply:  Yes, re-usable type fittings are an acceptable substitute for swaged fittings.  See solicitation Amendment.
<br><br>
 Q:  Item 10 states "Provide automatic water quality...........accept/reject of product water at 50ppm............" It is not generally possible to reduce the TDS of seawater to 50ppm. The normal specification and required water standard of USEPA is 500ppm. Is this what was intended?
<br>
Reply:  The item should read “…accept/reject water at 500ppm….”
<br><br>
Q:  Is it the intent of this solicitation to require the vendor to supply the individual components of an RO system that will be assembled/installed by the customer or for the vendor to supply a packaged system that contains the items listed?
<br>
Reply:  It is the intent of this solicitation to require the vendor to deliver the individual RO components FOB to Ketchikan, Alaska.  The customer will install/assemble the systems.  Three separate but identical RO systems will be installed in each of three Forest Service barges.  Due to the unique space constraints aboard the barges and for ease of maintenance, the Forest Service has chosen to order individual RO components instead of three packaged systems.  All components and interconnecting hoses and fittings should be sized such that the systems are ready for assembly.  The solicitation requires 100 feet of hose for each system and reusable fittings (see Amendment) for flexibility in system layout aboard the barges.

<DESC>Solicitation Number NA1341-03-Q-0654 is hereby amended to address the following vendor questions and revise two (2) of the specifications as follows:  Question: What is the required gas for the detectors, Xenon? Answer: There is no specific type of gas specified for the sealed gas-proportional detectors. Xenon (Xe-Co2) and P10 (Argon-Methane) are both acceptable. The detectors on PCM shall be sealed gas proportional detectors and require low maintenance. The detector windows shall be of a thin, industry standard type material such that detection of low energy betas is permitted, i.e., C-14; unsealed gas flow detectors are unacceptable. Question: If Xenon, how can the detection system detect Alpha particles (Radon), due to the Mylar windows being so dense (durability) for the sealed detectors?  Answers: NIST would like a low maintenance sealed detector system that measures contamination from alpha, beta and photon radiation and measures the Radon contamination without sounding an alarm from this contamination. To the best of our knowledge, no such machine exists. Therefore, NIST will drop the Radon contamination compensation specification (specification #12) entirely. The following specifications have been revised:  (12) Completely removed and (21) When installed the PCM shall have a maximum footprint of 54 inch x 54 inch and a maximum height of 92 inch.  The due date of August 18, 2003 @ 3 pm EST remains unchanged.

<DESC>The following RFI is modified to make a correction to the additional information in the specification.  2)was corrected to read as follows:  be backword compatible to quarter speed transmission over the HSI.  The Naval Air Systems Command Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209) is requesting additional industry information regarding mass memory data transfer and recording to achieve Tactical Aircraft Moving Map (TAMMAC) functionality on current production Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the F/A-18E/F, UH-1Y, AH-1Z, and MH-60, and legacy Navy and Marine Corps aircraft such as the F/A-18C/D and AV-8B as well as F/A-18 Foreign Military Sales (FMS). This Request for Information (RFI) provides amplifying details to RFI - Reference-Number-MU-03-RFI-0001 posted on 8 July 2003 and requests additional technical information on the capabilities of memory units within industry and on future developmental efforts.  The information obtained will be used to determine the availability of a memory unit (MU) with the potential to meet the stated objectives for use in the aircraft specified above to support the possibility of a full and open competition.   The desired objectives of the MU are included in the Performance Specification of the Tactical Aircraft Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC) Advanced Memory Unit (AMU) that will be provided upon request.  In addition to the information in the specification, the following updates may also be incorporated: 1) transfer data over High-Speed-Interface (HSI) copper cable; 2) be backward compatible to quarter speed transmission over the HSI; 3) satisfy existing program form, fit, function, and interface (F3I) integration and commonality requirements; 4) be compliant with all versions of Windows 2000, ME, XP, 98 and 95 operating systems allowing the unit to read/write data from/to a card formatted on all Navy ground mission planning or maintenance workstations having either internal or external PCMCIA card reader/writers; 5) recognize, read and write the following file formats: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS;  6) design the unit such that the hot-start maximum  and operating environment temperature is 85 degrees C while the non-operating and hot-storage temperature remains at 95 degrees C.  Additionally the HSI transmitter and receiver chipset is not required to be the Cypress Semiconductor HOTlink(TM) chipset however the transmitter and receiver chipset must meet all other specifications. Using the information in this RFI and the specification of the AMU, how long would it take your company to produce a qualified MU?  This response should include, but not be limited to your design and development monthly timeline, qualification test data to obtain flight clearance and basic details of the MU indicating how your unit will meet our specifications.  Interested parties should provide budgetary pricing and product information responses to this RFI no later than 29 August.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).   Address responses to:  Naval Air Systems Command, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Suite 256, Attn:  Janine Stratakes, Air-2.4.2.4.1, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547 or submit electronically to stratakesjm@navair.navy.mil.   Requests for a copy of the AMU specification should be submitted electronically to Janine Stratakes or Nellie Daugherty at daughertynm@navair.navy.mil.  THIS RFI DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND AS SUCH, IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS NOTICE NOR OTHERWISE PAY FOR INFORMATION REQUESTED. The Respondents may not be notified of the results of the Navy’s review of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  In the event a solicitation is released, there is minimal funding available to support NRE efforts. It is the responsibility of the potential offeror to monitor Federal Business Opportunities for the release of any follow-on information.  The Navy may use support contractor employees from Titan Systems to assist in reviewing the responses.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for a Laser Risk Reduction Project. As part of a Laser Risk Reduction Project, NASA Langley is planning to evaluate and compare the performance of different high power Laser Diode Arrays suitable for pumping 2-micron solid state lasers.  Laser Diode Array has been identified as one of the major risk areas for development and deployment of laser-based instruments in space.  Therefore, NASA Langley plans to acquire and characterize high power Laser Diode Arrays with different material compositions, architectures, and packaging in order to identify the best suited devices for pumping 2-micron solid state lasers. The lifetime and reliability of Laser Diode Arrays are particularly critical to NASA in meeting its objectives of deploying long life-time laser/lidar instruments in space.   The general requirements of these devices are listed below. Wavelength: 792 nm Spectral Width: 5 nm Peak Power: 600 W Pulse Duration:  1 msec Duty Factor:  1% Package: Conductively-Cooled The major parameters of interest are output beam quality and luminance,thermal characteristics, lifetime and reliability. The performance of the devices acquired under this procurement will be compared with each other and with the existing Laser Diode Arrays previously acquired by NASA Langley. The results of these studies will help defining the best suitable Laser Diode Arrays with highest level of reliability for future laser/lidar space missions.   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small and large businesses to provide housekeeping consulting services for the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center.  This request is for informational purposes only.   The Clinical Center is a 240-bed federally funded biomedical-research hospital that is located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States.  Patients are admitted to the Clinical Center for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.  Patients may be self referred or referred by their local physicians.  The Clinical Center admits patients from all over the world for clinical trials and natural history studies, with all care provided free of charge.  The Clinical Center accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 80,000 outpatient visits a year.  Specifically, this requirement is for an offeror to be responsible for the quality control of current housekeeping services to ensure Clinical Center requirements, JCAHO and OSHA standards are being met.  The current housekeeping services contractor is responsible for the cleaning of over 1,048,600 square feet of space which includes patient care areas, laboratories, exam rooms and offices in accordance with all pertinent JCAHO and OSHA standards.  This includes, bloodborne pathogen precautions, airborne pathogen precautions, radioactive precautions, tuburculosis and multi drug resistant tuburculosis precautions, medical waste handling and use and handling of cleaning chemicals and machinery.

<DESC>NA THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This Sources Sought Notice is seeking concerns for competitive consideration.  New England District has been tasked with investigating and resolving chlorinated solvent-related contamination at the former Ground Air transmitter  (GAT) located in the Town of Glenburn, Maine.  This phase of the work is to collect data to construct a conceptual site model.  This model will be the tool used to guide future efforts.  Characteristics of the local geology are as follows Ã¢Â€Â“ Much of t he study area is underlain by the Devonian to Silurian age Vasselboro and Fall Brook Formations comprising the New England Upland.  These units are characterized by 0.3-1.8 meter (m) thick massive beds of fine to medium grained feldspathic wacke.  Interbed s consist of dark gray phyllite, with minor carbonaceous phyllite and feldspathic coarse sand to granule conglomerate.   A 25-35 foot thick veneer of glacial till overlies most of the study area, and locally exceeds 50 feet near the Lakeview Cemetery.  The  till contains scattered boulders composed of granite to fine grained intrusive materials up to 5 feet in diameter. The proposed investigation focuses on the area around the Town Hall, and maximizes the use of existing wells in order to eliminate drilling new ones at this time.  The data collected during this phase will, when combined with other data sets, optimize futu re surface and subsurface investigation efforts with a minimum number of new wells and inconvenience to local residents.  The objectives of the borehole geophysical investigation are: a.	Characterize the structure and composition of the bedforck aquifer fabric b.	Measure depth and estimate composition of the glacial till overburden c.	Conduct fracture analysis and assess potential producing zones and controls d.	Measure field water quality/natural attenuation parameters of the borehole fluid. e.	Measure ambient vertical flow between and at fracture zones f.	Assess why the Town of GlenburnÃ¢Â€Â™s well does not contain TCE while nearby wells do. Required Tools and Support Equipment.  Contractor must have or have access to all of the geophysical logging tools necessary to complete this work..  Critical tools include the optical televiewer, Idronaut Water Quality Tool, and downhole geophone for vert ical seismic profiling. Data Format.  Contractor must deliver conventional log data and interpretation files compatible  with WellCAD and Viewlog borehole geophysics data processing packages.  Image log data and interpretations must be compatible with WellCAD.  These files will be further manipulated by the USACE CENAE hydrogeophysicist. Quality Assurance/Quality Control.  Contractor must collect and process all data in accordance  with USACE guidance outlined in EM 1110-1-1802 (Geophysical Exploration for Engineering and Environmental Investigations). Timeliness.  Contractor must be able to complete field and office work by 17 September 2003. Interested firms are requested to submit the following information:  A list of the equipment and geophysical logging tools that would be used on this project and evidence of their compatibility with software listed above.  List of projects on which the contractor has used this equipment as well as details of the project and a customer POC name and tel ephone number.   Responses must be received in this office ATTN:  Contracting Division, no later than 18 August 2003.

<DESC>THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, UNITED STATES TRUSTEE PROGRAM (USTP) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF BANKRUPCY FILINGS.  ONE ASPECT OF THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES IS THE CONDUCT OF SECTION 341(a) MEETINGS OF CREDITORS WHICH MUST BE RECORDED AND MAINTAINED FOR A SPECIFICED TIME PERIOD.  

THE CURRENT METHOD OF RECORDING THE MEETINGS IS TO RECORD MULTIPLE BACK-TO-BACK MEETINGS ON 45 MINUTE CASSETTE TAPES.  THE BENEFITS OF THE CURRENT RECORDING METHOD ARE THE EASE OF USE, UNIVERSAL FORMAT, AND THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE TAPES FOR REVIEW.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE RECORDING QUALITY IS VERY POOR, IT LACKS THE CAPABILITY TO EASILY LOCATE WHERE A MEETING BEGINS OR ENDS, AND THE TAPE MEDIA IS FRAGILE.

THE USTP IS INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO REPLACE THE CURRENT METHOD OF RECORDING THE SECTION 341(a) MEETINGS TO ENSURE THAT BOTH USTP PERSONNEL AND THE PUBLIC POSSESS A RECORDING PRODUCT THAT IS USER-FRIENDLY, OF THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING A QUALITY, LONGLASTING DIGITAL RECORDING THAT CAN BE EASILY CREATED, RETRIEVED AND DUPLICATED.  

THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE RECORDING EQUIPMENT SOLUTION IS TO BE DIGITAL; USER-FRIENDLY FOR CREATING THE RECORDING AND MAKING A CD; POSSESS THE CAPABILITY OF INSERTION OF TRACKS OR OTHER TIMEMARK FOR EACH MEETING AT THE TIME OF INITIAL RECORDING.  THE CAPABILITY TO LABEL EACH MEETING WITH A SHORT TEST TITLE, SUCH AS CASE NUMBER IS DESIRABLE.  IT IS PREFERRED THAT THE FINAL OUTPUT BE CD, PLAYABLE THROUGH A PERSONAL COMPUTER.  ANY SOLUTION REQUIRING SPECIALIZED SOFTWARE TO PLAY FINAL RECORDING MUST BE FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE TO THE PUBLIC.  ANY SOLUTION REQUIRING TRANSFER FROM INITIAL RECORDING TO FINAL OUTPUT MUST REQUIRE MINIMAL USER INPUT AND TECHNICAL SKILL.

INTERESTED SOURCES SHOULD PROVIDE A TEST MODEL WITH PRODUCT LITERATURE INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS.  THE TEST MODEL WILL BE RETURNED WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM RECEIPT.  IF A TEST MODEL IS NOT AVAILABLE, PLEASE PROVIDE COMPLETE PRODUCT INFORMATION.

<SUBJECT>99--SEEKING OFFERS TO DISSEMINATE NASA INFORMATION BY MEANS OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
<DESC>Seeking Offers to Disseminate NASA Information by Means of Consumer Products or Services Statement of Purpose The National Aeronautics and Space Administration seeks one or more unfunded collaborations with organizations that produce, market, distribute consumer goods or services for the sole purpose of disseminating information nationally about NASA's projects and programs.	  For example, a product might provide NASA information on packaging, as an insert in the packaging, or in other ways.   NASA is interested in reviewing creative proposals from organizations that would enhance strategically the Agency's ability to provide information on NASA's projects and missions to the public, especially for following age groups: ·      12-17 · 18-35   NASA will enter into as many qualified collaborations as possible, without limiting the types or categories of products or services considered. However, if multiple offers are received in one particular category, NASA may need to select only one offer in a product or service category for a specific time period (defined as "limited exclusivity").	It is intended that this request for entrepreneurial offers will result in the establishment of one or more non-reimbursable Space Act Agreements that will define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the proposing organization(s).	Benefits to Corporate Partner In exchange for a collaborator's investment to create and implement a means to creatively disseminate NASA information, NASA may consider negotiating brand placement, limited exclusivity (defined above) and other opportunities as part of a strategic collaboration.  Consideration may be made for those offers that are commensurate to the value of the above, and that reflect NASA mission and vision. Evaluation Criteria All proposals must demonstrate the following to be considered:  ·	The mission statements for the product or service being offered must complement NASA's Vision and Mission:   NASA's Vision is to improve life here, to extend life there and to find life beyond;	 NASA's Mission statement is "to understand and protect our home planet, to explore the universe and search for life, and to inspire the next generation of explorers…as only NASA can." ·   The product or service is available nationally, e.g. it could be used to disseminate NASA information across the nation.

The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Georgetown University Medical Center for the following service entitled:  Determination of Drug-Induced QT Interval Prolongation in Isolated Rabbit Hearts.

<DESC>Please Note that this requirement is designated for a sole source award. Companies that are interested in this requirement must demonstrate its capabilities to provide the required service by responding to this notice and complying with the provision herein.			

BACKGROUND

The Department of Commerce has been presented with a unique opportunity to market and promote the United States as a top tourism destination.  To best market the United States travel product abroad requires creating mechanisms that will encourage regional collaboration, private sector participation, cooperative brand marketing and the appropriate method for measuring return on investment or evaluation of the program's success.  It is important to note that the U.S. Government (USG) has not been involved in tourism promotional efforts since 1995.

As a precursor to designing an effective program and targeted promotional effort, it is important to involve stakeholder opinions and ideas, to develop ways to ensure private and public sector financial involvement, and to be prepared to measure program effectiveness.  In an atmosphere of terrorist threats and necessary improved border security systems, it is critical to consult and collaborate with other diplomatic and image efforts being conducted through other USG initiatives. Ways in which the balance can be maintained between promoting the U.S. to international targeted markets and implementing safety and security systems and procedures would also need to be addressed.
 
Task Order Title: 	Strategic Tourism Marketing Research
		
OBJECTIVE

To conduct a comprehensive research study to explore in depth a number of key issues, such as private sector collaboration, funding mechanisms, USG agency coordination and evaluation measurement methodologies, for building a strategic marketing plan for promoting the United States internationally as a tourism destination.

SCOPE, SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES FOR STATEMENT OF WORK


Task 1: 	Determine target markets for the international advertising and promotion campaign and the media mix, promotional methods and tourism products best suited for each target market.
 
Using the initial selection of markets which hold the most promise as stated by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Trade Development and Office of Travel and Tourism Industries experts (Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, and possibly Brazil, Italy and South Korea), the contractor shall: 

1.  Develop a matrix of regional marketing groups, states and cities who are currently and actively promoting in specific markets and determine which ones they would be interested in entering if not currently present.  This matrix would serve as part of the evaluation of target markets.	

 
2.	Validate the initial selection of the international markets to be targeted by conducting research with 25-35 key industry constituents on their level of agreement with potential markets as suggested by Commerce.

3.    Conduct interviews with 25-35 key industry constituents and marketers on the best approach to take for reaching each individual targeted market effectively.  This interview will cover queries on best media mix, in-market promotional activities and identification of tourism products most suited for each market. The constituents should include members of the Visit USA committee's in-market for the target markets.

	Schedule:  This investigation should be designed and completed three weeks after contract award.

	Deliverable:  The contractor shall deliver a written report not longer than 10 pages that addresses overall findings on the concurrence or dispute of the market selections and recommendations for the target markets.  The report should also denote the best media-mix, promotional activities and products for each suggested market.  Included in the report, each market shall be specifically detailed with the findings on the best promotional directions to take as a result of the interviews. 


Task II.	Determine the most appropriate methodologies for effectively evaluating promotional activities within the markets.

		It is well recognized that measuring a return on investment (ROI) for tourism advertising and promotion is individualized to each campaign.  With this in mind and considering the results of Task I, the contractor shall:

1.	Conduct interviews with 25 - 35 key industry constituents and marketers on the different and distinct methods employed for measuring effectiveness for international tourism advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

2.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 10 - 15 non-tourism industry marketers to determine the different and distinct methods employed for measuring effectiveness for international advertising, for promotional activities, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets. This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities. The contractor shall propose the intended list of contacts, to be agreed upon by DOC.

3.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 8 - 12 top tourism and non-tourism research firms on how return-on-investment (ROI) evaluations are performed for international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

4.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 5 - 8 top national tourism organizations (NTO's) on how return on investment (ROI) evaluations are performed for international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

5.	Identify key secondary resources available, gauging international tourism flows and impacts, and for measuring overall return on investment (ROI) for increased advertising and promotional activities in international markets.  This includes data that can be used for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

	
Schedule:  This investigation shall be designed and completed within four weeks.

	Deliverable:  A written document not longer than 15 pages shall be provided which addresses overall findings for each of the steps in Task II.  This report shall contain an executive summary with recommendations on the best methods to employ for gaining an evaluation of the effectiveness and return on investment for specific international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.   A more detailed account shall follow divided by each proposed targeted market as to the results of the investigations and interviews on measurements for each form of advertising and promotional activity, both from the perspective of tourism marketers and non-tourism marketers.



Task III.	Determine the most effective methods for engaging private sector and developing matching fund capabilities with private sector.

		Certainly the most effective campaigns are those that effectively perform industry outreach and capitalize on partnerships and expanded funding capabilities, particularly for the international markets.  Sustaining power in the marketplace comes through these partnerships as well as effective collaborative efforts.  With this in mind the contractor shall:

1.  Interview 25 - 35 industry representatives to identify outreach approaches the industry stakeholders are expecting as part of the development of the DOC international advertising and promotional campaign.
		
2.	Investigate and compare successful matching fund mechanisms and in-kind contribution models employed by key national, regional, state and local tourism destinations for international marketing. 

3.	Investigate and identify ways in which airlines and airports, trade associations and Visit USA committees can be involved and leveraged for their current and future programs and resources with the DOC campaign.

4.	Investigate and identify ways to collaborate with tourism promotion activities through such avenues as major travel web sites and online reservation engines.

5.	Investigate and identify mechanisms for successfully collaborating with international tour operators in the target markets for marketing special U.S.A. packages.
