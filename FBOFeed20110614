<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101, an ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR15.307.</p>

<DESC>This contract is for removal of lead-based paint and repainting of the south, east and partial north exterior sides of the historic US Army Air Corps Hangar at the Pearson Air Museum and includes window frames, trim, and incidental work to repair and/or replace excessively deteriorated wood.  The hangar is owned by the NPS, but is managed by the City of Vancouver and the Fort Vancouver National Trust. The historic hangar (1918) is a single-story, 5,250 square foot, timber-framed, clapboarded structure with sliding open bay doors on the west and east faces. The structure was rehabilitated in the 1990s and redeveloped as part of the Pearson Air Museum complex. It appears that the structure was partially sand-blasted and repainted with latex paint at that time. In 2009, the NPS and the City of Vancouver repainted the west face of the hangar. The exterior paint on the south and east faces contains lead-based paint and is now suffering from poor paint adhesion, and is peeling from many areas.
All work will be performed under a single Firm-Fixed Price construction contract subject to the Davis-Bacon Act.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is under $100,000 The period of performance will be 60 days after issuance of the Notice to Proceed.    PROJECT LOCATION:  The hangar is located at 1115 East 5th Street, Vancouver, WA.  Maps and information about the site is at  www.nps.gov/fova and www.fortvan.org/pages/pearson-air-museum.  We encourage you to attend the site visit on June 28, 2011 (details will be provided in the Request for Quotations, in Section L of the Clauses document).
SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for women-owned small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.1505.  The NAICS code for this project is 238320 and the small business size standard is $14.0 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  Payment protection will be required if the award exceeds $30,000.  All offerors must establish and/or maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov and complete the online representations and certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov prior to the RFQ closing date. 
The electronic Request for Quotations will be available on approximately June 16, 2011, at www.fbo.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research. The Government intends to establish a continuous engineering/technical service contract for the Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) in support of the Minuteman Weapon Systems at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.</p>
<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to The Boeing Company. For all test equipment at the SMIC, the contractor shall provide system level sustainment engineering, maintenance, and, upon request, operate the test equipment (e.g. Squadron Data Simulator (SDS), Missile Guidance Set (MGS), Guidance &amp; Control Laboratory Test Stand (GCLTS), Ground Test Signal Conditioner (GTSC), SMIC Data Acquisition System (SMIC DAS), Test Buffer Unit (TBU), Site Monitoring System, fully operational Minuteman Launch Facilities (LF) with ground test missiles, fully operational Minuteman Launch Control Centers (LCC), Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC) ground test station, and Wing Code Processor). The contractor will conduct testing, develop test plans, test directives, and standard operating procedures, design and/or develop upgrades to test stands, fabricate test fixtures, perform repair and troubleshooting as needed, perform and document data analysis, and provide other support (contractor acquired property, configuration management, hazardous waste management, MILSTRIP, commercial of the shelf purchasing and licensing, etc.) as required in fulfillment of this contract.</p>
<p>Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Boeing Company is the only currently qualified source for the engineering/technical services identified hereunder. Boeing has the intimate knowledge of the ICBM weapon system, classified and unclassified ICBM specification requirements, and SMIC unique test equipment and methods.</p>

<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005).<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Ms. Sharon Porter, by email at sharon.porter@hill.af.mil or 801-777-6549. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>NO NEED TO SUBMIT ANOTHER CAPABILITY STATEMENT IF YOU SUBMITTED ONE UNDER VA-316-11-RI-0007 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Office of Strategic Planning is conducting market research and seeking information from all interested research institutions and universities.  The goal is to create a sustainable partnership with an unbiased research institution and/or university that would provide the analytical and technical expertise to conduct targeted analysis of issues that are of great interest and importance to our customers, stakeholders, and leadership.  Generally, the types of services requested are:

	Data analysis 
	Labor Market Research 
	Policy research 
	Program evaluation 
	Cost/benefit analysis
	Resource identification 
	Strategic planning 

Specifically, we are interested in investigating the following issues that have tremendous impact on aligning where our organization is focused and where our organization should be heading in the near and long term.

1.	Strategic forecasting of customer demand - our customers demand for services has increased exponentially over the last couple years.  We need an algorithm(s) developed to help us forecast the overall demand for services, as well as a tiered structural breakdown of the type of services requested by customer demographics.

2.	Focused analytics to provide targeted resource identification - based upon our customers increasing demand for services, we need a capacity model to inform our leadership of the amount and of type of labor, capital, and technology resources needed to produce throughput at an equal level to customer demand.

3.	Labor market analysis to determine strategic locations for investment - currently our organization operates in numerous locations with a tremendous amount of variation in customer demand and location productivity.  We need to undertake an analysis that identifies the best locations/methods to recruit talent, as well as to provide targeted services for our customer base.

4.	Cost/benefit analysis related to policies and programs - our organization needs to evaluate policy and program outcomes in terms of service to our customers versus the internal/external cost of producing our products.    


Current Status:  VBA Office of Strategic Planning is responsible for strategic planning for the VBA.  The VBA administers Veteran's benefits to including education benefits, home loan guarantee, disability compensation, pensions, life insurance, survivor's benefits and vocational rehabilitation and employment.  The VBA is in the process of transforming the organization in order to improve efficiency and quality of services delivered.  The VBA currently process approximately 1.2 million disability and compensation claims each year, however the VBA is still not able to keep pace with the growing backlog of claims.         


Information Requested:  VBA is requesting that all interested research institutions and/or universities provide information regarding their capability to provide support and the analytical and technical expertise to conduct targeted analysis.  

The VBA may utilize the responses to this RFI to conduct additional market research.  It is possible that VBA may invite some respondents to meet with VBA Officials in person for oral presentations, and/or questions and answers.  Information obtained in this information request may be utilized to assist VBA in developing a solicitation.

<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to conduct an assessment of the roles and effectiveness of community-based organizations in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Preference will be given to small businesses.</p>
<p>SNAP is a federal nutrition assistance program that serves low- and no-income households. The program provides a nutrition safety net that helps alleviate food insecurity and increase access to healthy foods. Although the program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, individual states have operational responsibility for eligibility determinations, benefit issuance and case management.</p>
<p>SNAP serves more than one in seven Americans. In December 2010, nearly 44.1 million people received SNAP benefits, an increase of nearly 487,000 people from November. December is the twenty-sixth consecutive month that more people received SNAP benefits than at any time previously in the history of the program.</p>
<p>Concurrent with this steady increase in SNAP participation, states are also experiencing declining resources and daunting fiscal challenges. The worst recession since the 1930s has caused the steepest decline in state tax receipts on record at the same time the need for services has increased dramatically. As a result, even after making very deep spending cuts over the last several years, states continue to face large budget gaps. States will continue to struggle to find the revenue needed to support critical public services for a number of years, threatening the well-being of many low-income families.</p>
<p>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has taken several steps to facilitate efficient eligibility determination and case management through policy simplifications and providing waivers to states. States have also taken several measures to improve customer service and to deliver benefits more efficiently. These administrative and programmatic changes have included, but are not limited to, the postponement and/or waiver of the face-to-face interview at certification and recertification, shorter interviews, online eligibility screening and application completion, longer certification periods, reduction in required documentation, shortened application forms, electronic case files, and call centers. In addition to these policy, organization and technological changes, states have also developed a variety of partnerships with CBOs to improve the delivery of services to clients.</p>
<p>CBOs are non-governmental non-profit organizations that operate within a local community. Many are staffed by a combination of paid and unpaid personnel, while smaller organizations are fully staffed by volunteers. These organizations vary in size and offer a full range of community service programs. Over the past few years, CBOs have become increasingly involved with assisting SNAP applicants with the application process. Their roles vary widely, from making informational materials about SNAP available to their clients to providing direct assistance to SNAP applicants. Some also provide computers where applicants can access the application online. Others provide telephone and fax machines so that SNAP applicants can copy and fax documents, as needed. Many CBOs provide application assistance to SNAP applicants which includes assistance completing the application and gathering the necessary documentation.</p>
<p>To date, six states - Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada - have received waivers to allow CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants. None of these waivers are statewide. Some waivers apply to all SNAP applicants in designated parts of the state and others pertain to specific subgroups.</p>
<p>This procurement will compare program outcomes when CBOs conduct applicant interviews with program outcomes when SNAP staff conduct interviews in selected states. Key outcomes on which comparisons will be made include frequency of application denials for procedural reasons, application processing timeliness, payment accuracy, customer satisfaction, and customer experiences with the CBOs and the SNAP offices. FNS expects that between three and six states will participate in this study. All six states with waivers to partner with CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants will be invited to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The study objectives are:</p>
<p>1. Describe the CBOs conducting SNAP interviews and the nature of their partnerships with state and local SNAP agencies.<br />2. Describe the response of State SNAP staff to the involvement of CBOs in conducting applicant interviews.<br />3. Describe the response of CBO interviewers to their involvement with SNAP.<br />4. Describe the response of SNAP applicants who are interviewed by CBO staff for SNAP benefits to the involvement of CBOs in SNAP.<br />5. Describe the services that the CBOs offer?<br />6. Document the impacts of CBOs conducting SNAP interviews on program outcomes.</p>
<p>Information for this impact study should come from:</p>
<p>&bull; extant administrative data;<br />&bull; new administrative record keeping such as a tracking system for applications that are submitted by the CBOs;<br />&bull; site visits for CBO and SNAP office observations and to interview key SNAP and CBO staff, and SNAP applicants; and<br />&bull; survey data from SNAP applicants, SNAP staff and CBO staff.</p>
<p>Evaluation samples of SNAP applicants and QC case records must be randomly selected and large enough to detect both, statistically significant and meaningful differences between both groups.</p>
<p>FNS is seeking firms with the capability of:<br />&bull; designing and conducting multi-mode data collection, <br />&bull; manage and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data<br />&bull; conducting surveys, <br />&bull; managing and analyzing large data sets, <br />&bull; producing a high quality report, and<br />&bull; establishing successful relationships with state and local SNAP offices and with CBOs.</p>
<p>The firm must demonstrate the availability of adequate staff who are experienced in disciplines critical to the successful completion of the study objectives, including project management, evaluation design, survey methods, data collection techniques (including recruitment and training of field staff), descriptive and inferential statistics, and database management.</p>
<p>Finally, the firm must demonstrate an understanding of the special requirements of working with state and local SNAP offices and of the culture and environment of CBOs.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit capability statements that demonstrate its ability to perform all elements of the requirements as described in this notice. In addition, your response must include a description of your past experience on at least three (3) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which you performed in the past three years; and description of staff experience and skills.</p>
<p>The Statement of Capabilities should also include:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor Name<br />&bull; Address<br />&bull; Point of Contact (POC)<br />&bull; POC phone number and email address<br />&bull; DUNS number, and<br />&bull; Business status (i.e., large/small business, disadvantaged, Hub Zone, woman-owed, etc.)<br />&bull; GSA MOBIS schedule ( If your firm has GSA MOBIS schedule)</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of offeror submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. No questions will be entertained or comment responded to by the Government. Offerors capable of providing these services should submit the information requested above via e-mail to ty.sar@fns.usda.gov and no later than 2PM Eastern Standard Time, May 25, 2011.</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be evaluated. <br />&emsp;<br />Attachment<br />Additional Information on Procurement</p>
<p>Scope of Study</p>
<p>FNS expects that between three and six states will participate in this study. All six states with waivers to partner with CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants will be invited to participate in the study. Every effort will be made to recruit at least three of the six states. This study will compare relevant program outcomes associated with CBO-conducted applicant interviews CBOs with outcomes observed when interviews are conducted by SNAP staff. Outcomes that will be examined include frequency of denials for procedural reasons, application timeliness, payment accuracy, customer satisfaction, and customer experience with the CBOs and the SNAP offices. <br />Data shall be collected from different sources and through a variety of methods, including but not limited to:<br />&bull; extant administrative data;<br />&bull; new administrative record keeping such as a tracking system for applications that are submitted by the CBOs;<br />&bull; site visits for CBO and SNAP office observations and to interview key SNAP and CBO staff, and SNAP applicants; and<br />&bull; survey data from SNAP applicants, SNAP staff and CBO staff.</p>
<p>Evaluation samples of SNAP applicants and QC case records must be randomly selected and large enough to detect both, statistically significant and meaningful differences between both groups.</p>
<p>Project objectives and research questions are described below.<br />Objective 1: Describe the CBOs conducting SNAP interviews and the nature of their <br />partnerships with state and local SNAP agencies.</p>
<p>1. What key factors describe the CBOs? Provide details about size, type of CBO (community-based, part of regional or national network), range of services, t staffing, the population served, funding etc. Do the CBOs have funding from other sources that support their work in SNAP?<br />2.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br />
<p><br />U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Administration, Bureau of Oceans, Environment and International Scientific Affairs (OES), is issuing a Sources Sought request to seek information and capability statements from qualified firms to provide logistical, administrative and financial management services to the State Department's Office of Science and Technology Cooperation STC for the travel of the U.S. science envoys. This request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposals. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this Sources Sought. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to receive feedback and capability statements from industry and is in support of market research.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Following the President's statement in Cairo in 2009, "On science and technology, we will appoint new science envoys to collaborate on programs that develop new sources of energy, create green jobs, digitize records, clean water, grow new crops." Secretary of State Clinton announced the U.S. Science Envoy Program on November 3, 2009. The State Department's Office of Science and Technology Cooperation (STC), in the Bureau of Oceans, Environment and International Scientific Affairs (OES) coordinates this program and since 2009, has had six science envoys who have travelled to more than 12 countries. In coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), OES selects science envoys to travel to foreign countries to elevate the visibility of U.S. interest in pursuing partnerships in science and technology, engineering, medicine, and innovation.</p>
<p>STC works closely with embassy public affairs offices and the relevant State Department regional bureaus for the planning of the envoys' travel itinerary and meeting schedule. The science envoy activities include senior governmental meetings, scientific meetings, dinners and press events to enhance U.S. global engagement consistent with the President's vision. Previous science envoys have met with foreign heads of state, ministers and senior government officials, university deans, leading scientists and intellectuals, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and business leaders. The science envoys engage on specific issues within their area of expertise, as well as addressing topics that the U.S. has identified as areas of high priority and opportunities for science and technology cooperation in the region. As a result of their experiences as envoys, they provide a report to inform the U.S. government on activities in the region and make recommendations for U.S. government initiatives on international science and technology collaboration.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>This requirement will establish a new Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the services described herein. Services include the ability to provide logistical, administrative and financial management services to the STC for the travel of the U.S. science envoys.</p>
<p>STC works with the science envoys' offices and U.S. embassies to establish the dates and develop the itinerary and scope of the tour, including selecting travel locations in the host countries, coordinating media events and managing the envoy's meeting schedule. The duration of each envoy trip is less than 10 days. Some envoys may have multiple trips and include one stop in Washington DC. STC anticipates between 6-9 tours in FY11. Fund allocation and logistical arrangements for the envoys' travel were previously managed by STC using individual travel grants, however, a more efficient mechanism to disperse funds and manage travel logistics for future envoys will be provided by a vendor as described in this Scope of Work.</p>
<p>The vendor must have the capacity to provide administrative and logistic support to the STC for approximately 6-9 science envoy tours per year. Each tour will last approximately one week to ten days. Each tour may require multiple trips to selected countries with one final consultation trip to Washington DC. The contractor must have previous experience arranging international travel for governmental programs within an agreed budget.</p>
<p>The performance period will commence at the time of contract award and cover a period of 12 months with four 1-year option years.</p>
<p><br />Travel Services:</p>
<p>1) International Travel Arrangements: When called for by the program and provided for by the budget the vendor shall arrange for visas and reserve, purchase and distribute tickets for international air and ground travel of the science envoys. The vendor will purchase the tickets at cost-effective prices and, towards this end, will compare government and market rates when making the arrangements. The vendor shall use the "Fly America" rule in booking international flights. The vendor shall provide the tickets and/or other travel documents to the science envoys no later than 5 days prior to the start of the travel. With prior approval from STC, the vendor is authorized to make hotel, air and car rental changes as the need arises.</p>
<p>2) Domestic Travel Arrangements: When called for by the program and provided for by the budget, the vendor shall reserve, purchase and distribute tickets for domestic travel for of the science envoy including air and ground travel and car rental. The tickets should be obtained at cost-effective prices and, towards this end, the vendor will compare government and market rates making the arrangements. The vendor shall provide the tickets and/or other travel documents to the science envoys no later than 5 days prior to the start of the travel. With prior approval from STC, the vendor is authorized to make hotel, air and car rental changes as needed.</p>
<p>3) Per Diem: The vendor shall provide per diem to the science envoys, using allowable USG perdiem rates which may be distributed in advance of the travel.</p>
<p>4) Other Direct Costs: The vendor shall disburse additional funds for other direct costs to the science envoy as indicated in the project budget and pre-approved by the STC. These other direct costs may include, but are not limited to, allowances for phone cards, taxi, porter fees, research materials, periodicals, newspapers, magazines, cell phone expenses. The amount of other direct costs will be included in the project budget. The vendor shall provide funds for the direct costs to the science envoy no later than 5 days prior to the start of the tour. The envoy will keep receipts and provide a cost breakdown of expenses at the conclusion of the tour.</p>
<p><br />Scope of Sources Sought:</p>
<p>Potential sources either alone or with appropriate teaming partners must have demonstrated expertise and capability to provide the full range of services identified above.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to establish multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for various hard-to-find and those limited supply type pharmaceuticals and/or injectibles.  A combined synopsis/solitication will be issued no later than 30 June 2011.  NOTE: All pharmaceuticals purchased from BPA CALLs processed against the Master Blanket Purchase Agreement MUST be FDA approved.  Duration of the BPAs will be for a base period, plus extendable for four one-year periods.<br><br>Master BPAs entered into as a result of this notice will establish multiple supply sources that will provide a streamlined method for procuring those hard-to-find and limited supply products as needed.   The objectives are to ensure availability and consistency of product for use in the Western Regional Medical Command at the best possible price while reducing processing time/workload for all parties, streamlining the payment process, and reducing vendor payment time.  Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom a Master BPA will be issued, a bilateral BPA requiring the quoter's signature will be issued.  A Master BPA will be in existence once both the quoter and the Contracting Officer has signed the agreement. A Master Blanket Purchase Agreement is not a funded contract.  The Master BPAs awarded will be for "hard-to-find" or "in short supply" type pharmaceuticals/biologicals and injectibles.   Sources of supply for the requestor is as follows:<br><br>(1) Prime Vendor<br>(2) Secondary Vendor<br>(3) Manufacturer<br><br>After required sources of supply are checked for products - and it is found that the product is not available or can only be received in a limited number and more is required - the Blanet Purchase Agreements can be used.  Only those items that are not available through the required sources or that are in short supply may be purchased under the BPAs.<br><br>The Point of Contact/COR will contact each BPA holder to verify current availability and pricing of each "hard-to-find" item.  The funded BPA CALL will be placed with the Contractor that can provide the items in a timely manner, at a price considered fair and reasonable.  The order will be placed with the Contractor that offers the best value to the Government.  CALLs may or may not be placed with the lowest priced Contractor, but placed with the Contractor that can provide the medications the quickest.  In some instances, the pharmaceuticals are needed in a 24 hour period (or less) and the availability is a "life or death" issue.  In the event of a standard delivery, availability and pricing will be the determining factors.  <br><br>*NOTE:  All Master BPA holders may or may not be contacted in an emergency situation in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) Exceptions to the fair opportunity process.   The Contracting Officer will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for an order exceeding $2,500 unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. <br><br>After issuance of Master Blanket Purchase Agreement, a BPA CALL will be generated.  This BPA CALL will be funded with an estimated amount of dollars to cover those "as required/as needed" items for a specific time frame.  The time frame will be set up on a Fiscal Year basis (1 Oct - 30 Sep).  BPA CALL values are estimated and ordering may or may not use all funding during the time frame covered.  The Contracting Officer has the authority to de-obligate excess funding unilaterally at the end of each BPA CALL.  This is covered in the Addendum to FAR 52.212-4 in the solicitation.<br>BACKGROUND:  Western Regional Medical Command  and Western Regional Contracting support the military population (and eligible family members) located in the Western Region  (CO, KS, MO, CA, AZ, WA, AK, and western part of TX) and the local civilian population in emergencies.  All the associated pharmacies (both in the hospital and the outlying clinics) purchase their pharmaceuticals through the Main Prime Vendor, Secondary Prime Vendor, or directly from the manufacturer.<br><br>As certain pharmaceuticals are required, it will occasionally fall upon the Department of Pharmacy to seek other than the directed sources of supply for those items that are included in a nationwide shortage or may be deemed too expensive through the directed sources.  Competition must be accomplished among distributors and is very time consuming.  Sometimes the requirement for certain pharmaceuticals is a life or death matter and the time spent looking for sources may cause injury or life threatening damages beyond repair.  A source of supply that can provide those "hard-to-find" items needs to be available at any time, day/night, weekends, etc. for those critically needed supplies that cannot be purchased through the Prime or Secondary Prime vendor or directly from the manufacturer.<br>GENERAL:  The contractor shall provide those hard-to-find or items that are short on supply nationwide as required (if in their power).  Inability to provide those types of pharmaceuticals will not be viewed as a failure or in a negative manner against the contractor.  Master Blanket Purchase Agreements, established to allow maximum flexibility and efficiency in the procurement of such items.  The Government may place BPA CALLs to fund the estimated expenditures for the entire year with one order, or may place multiple BPA CALLs during the year for limited periods.  BPA CALLs will not cross fiscal years (except for required delivery time).<br><br>This contract uses a CLIN structure that allows purchase of all items within the scope of the items covered by this contract.  The quantity and types of items needed for those medical treatments and emergencies vary over time based on patient needs.  Each BPA CALL will be funded with a specific amount and allow the facility to place telephonic orders for specific requirements/emergencies against that BPA CALL until the funds are depleted.  This also allows for procurement of new items as technology advances without the need to modify the contract to include them.<br><br>Estimated item quantities and/or line item pricing will not be listed on the Master Blanket Purchase Agreement or CALL.  Delivery orders will reflect a number in the Quantity field equivalent to the number of dollars for which the delivery order is funded.  There is no expressed or implied guarantee that the purchases under the BPA CALL will exhaust all funds.   <br><br>New Products/Product Upgrades:  The contractor will also provide to the COR product literature for the new items and a detailed description of the differences between the new items and any existing items they replace or to which they can be compared, and a specific analysis of the comparative advantages/disadvantages of the items involved.<br><br>The contractor shall furnish product within 24-hours for emergency situations and as quickly as possible for standard requests.  The contractor shall provide an itemized and priced packing slip, which shall accompany each order at the time of delivery.  NOTE:  Contractor shall provide a copy of the invoice from their source of supply in order to keep a "paper trail" for the pharmaceuticals being purchased.<br>If interested, please e-mail sandra.broten@us.army.mil for further information.<br>

The BPAs will have a performance period of up to 5 years and the anticipated value of each BPA is $150,000.00 for the 5 years.  For this acquisition, North American Industrial Classification System code is 444130 and the Small Business Size Standard is $7.0 Million in average annual receipts. This acquisition is a Small Business Set-Aside. It is anticipated that the BPA will be issued on or about June 21, 2011.  Interested vendors who are able to provide the supplies, must submit a price list with delivery lead times, if not available for local pickup/delivery.  This information will be reviewed by the Government Technical Representative for consideration.  Additional BPAs may result from this notice if the interested vendor is found to be able to provide the supplies required by the Government.
Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.

<DESC>The Joint CREW I1B1 acquisition program (formerly JCREW 3.3) provides the military services with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from Radio-Controlled IEDs (RCIED). The Joint CREW Program is managed by PMS-408 EOD/CREW and it intends to host an UNCLASSIFIED Open Business (OB) Industry Day to increase Governments access to creative innovation while educating prospective vendors on strategies to provide new capabilities and services to our warfighters. This event is open to system integrators, innovators, and third party suppliers.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME; any release will be announced on www.FedBizOps.gov. The Government anticipates awarding one or more contracts on or about the 2nd Quarter GFY13 with initial delivery planned for on or about GFY15.
 The information provided is for information only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this announcement nor will the Government return any data provided.  

This Industry Day will discuss future acquisition strategies leveraging the benefits of open architecture design elements to create the means for third-party technology innovators to participate in a coherent development, procurement and validation of system and sub-system level technology insertion /technology refresh (TI/TR).  Currently, PMS-408 EOD/CREW plans for a series of incremental developments to enable technology insertion and technology refresh as follows:  1) Technology insertion updates cut into the existing production line to include hardware, firmware or software, into existing production line every three years, 2) Periodic technology refresh of fielded systems every six years (retrofitting - fielded systems) to maintain common baselines and to account for obsolescence while countering the rapidly evolving threat.
  

The JCREW System of Systems (SoS) approach includes three distinct systems that utilize common hardware, software and firmware components.  These systems are: dismounted system (man-portable), mounted system (ground vehicle and waterborne), and fixed site system (temporary geographical area and permanent).  The overall system architectures open, modular and flexible design ensures the ability to upgrade the product baseline for performance, affordability, availability and reliability.  

The Industry Day will be on 8 August 2011 and held at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, Kossiakoff Center, 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel, Maryland 20723.  Directions to Kossiakoff Center may be provided upon registration.
  Breakfast and lunch will be provided at a cost of $20.00 (cash only) per person to be collected upon registration. Space constraints make it necessary to limit attendance to two personnel per company. To register, please contact Horace Botts, at 703.729.3449, x111, email:  JCREWID2011@ridgewoodpartners.com by 22 July 2011. The email shall include the participants full name, company they are representing, along with their titles and email addresses. All visitors will need to check in at the Kossiakoff Center and registration will be verified prior to entrance. The tentative agenda is below.  All the briefings will remain at the unclassified level presenting the acquisition strategy, the high-level system requirements, and future technology requirements.

Relocate/restore golf course fairway and greens in the site footprint.  Equipment associated with this project include (1) prewired workstations, (2) telecommunications equipment and (3) intrusion detection systems.<br><br>A PLA is defined as a prehire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: (a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law.  Reference: Provision: FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement, Clause: FAR 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br><br>The construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />Please provide a BRAND NAME OR EQUAL quote. If an or equal quote is submitted, the proposal will be sent to the technical advisor for compatibility verification. ANY OFFEROR PROVIDING AN OR EQUAL PRODUCT SHOULD DESCRIBE THOROUGHLY HOW THEIR PRODUCT MEETS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS LISTED BELOW IN THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL MAKE THAT OFFEROR NON-RESPONSIVE AND WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES<br />Password Policy Enforcement Product Description</p>
<p>USSOCOM requires an Enterprise Password Policy Enforcement tool that improves network security by ensuring users choose strong passwords. The product should check every new password for compliance with password policies outlined in USSOCOM M 380-3 and DISA Standard Technical Implementation Guides (STIG)(attached documents) for Microsoft Operating Systems requiring sites to have a password complexity software product. The product must be able to immediately reject non-compliant passwords. Microsoft Windows has a basic password complexity rule, but it accepts many weak passwords like "Secret1" and "Pa$word". We require a software tool that allows us to enforce almost any password policy imaginable. Also need the capability to create multiple password policies and assign them to individual users, groups, and Organizational Units.</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY THE PRODUCT MUST:</p>
<p>a. Help users to choose passwords<br />Help users to choose a compliant password, thereby reducing the number of password related helpdesk calls. Users can see the password policy as they enter their password, and are told exactly why their password was rejected. Administrators can customize the policy and rejection messages.</p>
<p>b. Multiple password policies<br />Enforce multiple password policies in each domain. Policies can be assigned to users, groups, and Organizational Units. Should be able to exempt some accounts from the PPE password policy, or allow administrators to bypass the policy when resetting a user's password.</p>
<p>c. Powerful password policy rules<br />Possess highly configurable rules. Require users to comply with all rules, or enforce a more tolerant policy by allowing partial compliance. Relax the password policy requirements when a passphrase (long password) is used. Rules can be combined to create complex requirements such as "password must contain a numeric character, but not in the first position".</p>
<p>d. Advanced dictionary rule<br />The dictionary rule is the most important rule because it detects the most vulnerable passwords and has the greatest impact on server performance. It should allow administrators to control non-alpha character detection, character substitution detection, bidirectional analysis, wildcard analysis, and match tolerance to give administrators granular control over their password policy. The dictionary must have no impact on server performance.</p>
<p>e. Controlled password expiry<br />Need a Maximum Age rule, allowing us to gradually expire passwords over days or weeks. Microsoft Windows expires passwords when they reach their maximum age, possibly triggering hundreds or thousands of forced password changes when the maximum password age rule is first enabled. Password expiry modes limit the number of daily expirations, so the helpdesk can deal with any additional load.</p>
<p>f. Customizable e-mail reminders<br />Send up to three e-mail reminders to users before their passwords expire. This is especially useful for users who logon infrequently, and for remote users who access the network without logging on to the domain.</p>
<p>g. Integrated policy testing<br />Integrated policy testing would allow us to quickly test your password policy before enforcing it. Use the test results to identify and correct configuration errors, and to determine if the password policy meets our security requirements.</p>
<p>h. Password synchronization<br />Allow synchronization the user's password with other systems or applications.</p>
<p>i. Password Reset integration<br />Require the capability for a self service password management system that allows users to reset their password and unlock their account without calling the helpdesk.</p>
<p>j. Product Deployment<br />The password policy enforcer software deployment must be able to be configured and deployed across the USSOCOM Enterprise without using any hours from the existing workforce. It also must not require any new training for SIE network operators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This software must also meet the following DODI 8500.2 controls:<br />IAIA-1 &amp; 2 Individual Identification and Authentication<br />DoD information system access is gained through the presentation of an individual identifier (e.g., a unique token or user logon ID) and password. For systems utilizing a logon ID as the individual identifier, passwords are, at a minimum, a case sensitive, 8-character mix of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, including at least one of each (e.g., emPagd2!). At least four characters must be changed when a new password is created.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br><br>    (i)  Technical: the item(s) offered will be evaluated as providing or complying with all the requirements set forth the specification/statement-of-work.  This evaluation will result in a determination of technical acceptability or unacceptability.  Exceeding the technical requirements will not result in a more favorable evaluation since the overall technical evaluation will be Pass/Fail.<br>   (ii)   Price:  Offerors are advised to provide the most competitive pricing they can with the initial proposal submission.<br>   (iii)   Past performance:  Offerors must submit three (3) examples of past performance.  The examples shall have been performed within the past three years (3 yr).  Past performance examples will be evaluated for Relevance and Quality.  <br>         <br>        (A)  Relevance is defined as fulfilling the same or similar requirement for the same or similar quantities under the same or similar circumstances.  An example which is considered to be ideally on-point is one which satisfied the same technical requirement for the same quantity, provided to a Government customer, and within the same delivery timeframe as required under this solicitation.   It is not required to submit examples which are ideally on-point; however, offerors should strive to provide those examples which are as relevant as possible. <br>         <br>        (B)  Quality is evaluated as overall customer satisfaction, including but not limited to:  performance of the equipment and services provided; timeliness of delivery;  willingness to negotiate and accommodate changes;  cost control;  processing of warranty claims;  performance of maintenance agreements;  availability of general customer support.  <br>        (C)   Three (3) examples of past performance shall be included in the offeror's proposal.  Each example shall have the following information:<br>  Contract or Sales Number;<br>  Date of Sale;<br>  Dollar Value of the Contract<br>  Equipment and services provided;<br>  Customer/Agency Name;<br>  Customer Point of Contact (POC) and position within the company/agency;<br>  Customer POC telephone number.<br>         (D)   Should the offeror provide more than three (3) examples of past performance, the Government is not obligated to contact more than the first three.  Offerors should confirm that the POC telephone numbers are accurate and in service; failure to provide valid telephone numbers does not obligate the Government to further pursue those examples of past performance.  <br>         (E)   In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br>         (F)   Nothing in this solicitation prohibits the Government from obtaining and considering past performance from any source available.<br>         (G)   Negative information obtained during past performance evaluations will be provided to the offeror to be addressed unless such negative information or circumstances have already been addressed by the offeror.  <br>     <br>PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE ARE REPRESENTED AS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL IN IMPORTANCE IN THIS EVALUATION.  AWARD MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MADE TO THE FIRM WHO SUBMITS THE LOWEST PRICED PROPOSAL. In the case of equal ratings of past performances, price will be the deciding factor for award.  <br><br>(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obliogate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The combined synopsis/solicitation number is W91CRB-11-R-0048. This requirement is for a vehicular-based modular, portable standard +12VDC powered CDMA, GSM, UMTS and iDEN interrogation, tracking and locating, and signal interrogation system. Three systems are required: System 1 will provide a multi-transmit and receiver platform, System 2 will provide a single channel platform and System 3 will provide a very compact transceiver platform.  Specific information regarding each system is provided in W91CRB-11-R-0048 - Attachment 1. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract resulting from this solicitation to the most responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be best overall value to the Government. The evaluation factors are:  technical capability, sustainment capability, past performance and cost, with technical capability, sustainment capability and past performance being equal and each is considered substantially more important than cost. While cost is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of a contractor for this RFQ, the degree or importance of cost as a factor could be greater depending upon the equality of the proposals for other factors evaluated; e.g. where competing proposals are determined to be substantially equal, total cost and other cost factors would become the controlling factor. Contractors are requested to provide FOB Destination pricing for the aforementioned quantities, to include your best delivery schedule. Delivery will be made to Arlington, VA.  Desired delivery date for all items is within 60 days; however, offerors are encouraged to propose alternate delivery schedules if the 60 day complete delivery cannot be met. The following provisions apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1 and 52.212-2. Responses to this RFQ must include :  (1) company name, address, city/state/zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, company web site (if applicable); and name, title/position and telephone number of the individual point of contact; (2) commercial and technical literature on the product you believe will satisfy the Government's requirement or an internet address where that data is available; (3) Previous experience with this system, particularly sales to Government agencies; (4)  per unit cost which includes FOB Destination  shipping to Arlington, VA and a one (1) year of maintenance support. If the desired delivery schedule cannot be met offeror's proposed production will be evaluated as an advantage or disadvantage in the technical evaluation. Pricing data must include the cost of the system and all required GSA discount (s), if available, and any and all additional discounts you propose to provide. Open Market items not on an offeror's Federal Supply Schedule may be included in proposals, however, they must be clearly identified as Open Market Items, defined as to content and purpose and cost in accordance with FAR 8.402 (f) entitled "Federal Supply Schedules". Offerors shall, in the event the item being quoted is from a Federal GSA/VA Schedule, furnish the following information with your quotation: GSA/VA Contract Number, expiration date of contract, minimum/maximum order limitation, additional offered discounts, Contractor and Government Entity Code (CAGE), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN). VENDORS MUST PROVIDE ALL REQUESTED INFORMATION AND COMPLETE ALL CLAUSES OR THEIR QUOTATION MAY BE RENDERED NOT ACCEPTABLE. Proposal should be no more than 20 pages in total length. An award will be made to the source that is responsible, whose offer conforms to the requirement and that represents the best overall value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the four (4) evaluation factors.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

The Government plans to make a single contract award.                                                                           See attached matrix1.   INTRODUCTION:Under the provisions of P.L. 107-110 "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB) and the Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of Education the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) is designated as the State Educational Agency (SEA) for 183 instructional and residential programs in 23 states that receive funding under NCLB.  The BIE provides oversight and supervision for schools that are funded under P.L. 95-561 that are operated by the BIE and for tribally operated schools that are funded under the provisions of P.L. 100-297 and P.L. 93-638 that receive funding under NCLB.  100% of the students that attend BIE operated and funded programs meet the criterion for being socially and economically disadvantaged which qualifies these schools to receive funding under NCLB.As the SEA for these schools the BIE is responsible for ensuring that students with disabilities are provided with a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, Part B, Section 612(a)(1)(A), December 3, 2004, (IDEA).2.   BACKGROUND:Approximately 44,000 students are enrolled in the BIE funded schools, of which approximately 15% are identified as children with a disability according to the Native American Student Information System (NASIS); the Bureau's data system used by BIE funded schools. The SEA is required to meet all components of the IDEA Act of 2004. This act stipulates that each SEA must ensure that each public agency establish, maintain, and implement procedural safeguards that meet the requirements of 34 CFR ?300.500 through ?300.536 Subpart B-Procedural Safeguards Due Process Procedures for parents and children is the component that addresses the processes for dispute resolution. The dispute resolution process as defined in statue and regulation is the enforcement tool of resolving disagreements between parents and schools whenever an alleged violation of the rights of a student with disabilities or a technical violation of the statue has been filed.  The dispute resolution processes make available three options for use by parents and schools to resolve dispute: (1) mediation; (2) state complaints; and (3) due process hearings. Due process hearing is the enforcement tool available to the complainant that address matters relating to the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of an eligible child, or the provision of FAPE to a child with a disability.  This is the formal process for the dispute resolution process.  It also requires the most time and financial resources to both parties.  The hearing officers are currently provided through the Office of Hearing and Appeals for the Due Process Hearings. The purposes of this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract are:(1)   To ensure that the BIE has an effective dispute resolutions system in place as a required component of IDEA;(2)   To maintain a list of qualified state complaint investigators to address and investigate disputes in a timely manner as required by the IDEA; and(3)   To maintain a list of qualified mediators to address and mediate disputes in a timely manner as required by the IDEA. 3.   SCOPEBIE requires the services of a contractor who shall provide qualified individuals who will serve as mediators and state complaint investigators who are knowledgeable about the laws and regulations relating to the provision of special education and related services according to the IDEA BIE funded schools located in 23 States. 6. CONTRACTOR TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIESThe contractor is responsible for furnishing all equipment, connectivity, supplies, travel, transportation of goods or equipments, or additional professional services needed to carry out the requirements of the solicitation.Also See Attached RFQ

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to George Washington University, School of Public Health and Health Services, Department of Health Policy, 2021 K. Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, for updated legal surveys and analyses of state laws related to (1) vaccination benefits for adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) provision of vaccination services by non-physician healthcare providers under standing orders, and (3) vaccination requirements for employees and residents in long-term care facilities, based on three previous reviews conducted by George Washington University. Purpose and Objective: Legislative Review &amp; Analysis of State Laws Related to Immunization. The purpose of this project is to update three comprehensive legislative reviews exploring laws related to immunization in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Topics covered by these reviews include (1) vaccination benefits offered to adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) scope of immunization practice by non-physician practitioners under their own license and standing orders protocols, and (3) vaccination requirements for staff and residents at long-term care facilities. State immunization laws are constantly evolving in response to new scientific discoveries, political pressures, and other external factors. Updating these reviews will ensure that CDC has access to the most current information available related to state immunization laws. This information is critical to CDC&rsquo;s ability to (1) track the impact of healthcare reform on access to vaccination benefits and (2) to conduct and provide technical assistance for emergency preparedness planning that fully utilizes available healthcare resources in each state. Public health authorities at the national, state, and local levels will benefit from understanding how non-physician providers can be used to expand vaccination opportunities both during pandemic or bioterrorism events as well as during non-emergency vaccination campaigns. Policymakers and researchers can use information about Medicaid vaccination benefits to monitor potential disparities in access between currently eligible beneficiaries and those who gain coverage under Affordable Care Act expansions of Medicaid. The goal of this contract is to build on work already completed by researchers at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Public Health and Health Services as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law project. GWU published three reports on the above-referenced topics between Winter 2003 and Winter 2007 (research was completed from approximately Spring 2003 to Spring 2007). These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. CDC is perceived by state and local health authorities and researchers as the preeminent resource for information related to public health, up to and including laws and regulations governing public health. As a result, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases regularly receives queries from the public on aspects of state law pertaining to immunization. The updates proposed in the present statement of work will provide CDC with the information needed to furnish appropriate technical assistance to its grantees and to the public, as well as targeting our efforts in collaboration with professional and other organizations. Specific objectives of this contract are to: (1) Update the 2003 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Medicaid Coverage of Immunizations for Non-Institutionalized Adults.&rdquo; (2) Update the 2007 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;State Laws Related to the Use of Standing Orders Covering Immunization Practice.&rdquo; (3) Update the 2005 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Immunization Requirements for Staff and Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities Under State Laws/Regulations&rdquo; (4) Update the project website housed at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/ to display the updated reports and related materials as necessary. (5) Develop and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed, legal and public health journals and health professional newsletters and magazines disseminating findings of updated legal review. Background and overview: CDC provided initial funding for The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law in 2002. The overall goals of the Project were to achieve greater understanding of the policy barriers to immunization financing and access and furnish technical assistance support to initiatives that promote change. These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. During the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, there was particular interest in understanding how non-physician providers could assist in mass vaccination efforts in order to rapidly increase communitywide coverage with 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. However, interest in expanding access to vaccination services has prompted changes in state law since 2007, particularly with regard to immunization practice by pharmacists. In addition, personnel shortages experienced during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic response may have prompted states to expand the scope of practice of non-physician providers in preparation for future emergency response activities. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expands Medicaid eligibility to persons living at up to 133% of the federal poverty level, representing a significant expansion in coverage for childless adults. Newly-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries will have access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines without cost-sharing as determined by provisions of the ACA; however, current adult Medicaid beneficiaries are not covered by these provisions. In order for CDC to monitor the effect of the ACA on access to vaccinations, a baseline level of benefits must be established. Since GWU&rsquo;s initial report, three new vaccines (human papillomavirus, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, and herpes zoster vaccine) have been recommended for use among some adults 18-64. In addition, increasing budgetary pressures at the state government level have likely affected benefits provided to current Medicaid-eligible adults. Increased interest in vaccination of healthcare personnel as an important indicator of healthcare quality has increased the prominence, and potentially the prevalence, of state laws requiring vaccination of healthcare personnel in various healthcare settings. The Joint Commission is currently updating its accreditation standard for influenza vaccination of staff in long-term care facilities to expand the facilities covered and the activities required for accreditation. A review of current laws related to vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities will determine which states may be better equipped to comply with national reporting requirements related to vaccination of healthcare personnel in long-term care settings. With the exception of the proposed contractor, no organization or unit within or outside CDC currently tracks and summarizes laws related to the above-referenced topics. In the absence of the proposed review, there is no central repository of legal information that can inform the planning, monitoring, and technical assistance activities described in Section 1.0. Scope of Work: For this project, the Contractor will submit a plan for completion of the work described herein. Throughout the award period, the Contractor will submit reports describing progress toward completion of the project tasks. At the end of the project period, the Contractor will summarize findings during the time of the project and submit three reports detailing changes in state laws related to the topics described above. More detailed requirements are given below. Place of Performance/Hours of Operation: Work will take place at the contractor&rsquo;s site. Period of Performance: The period of performance is 24 months from the date of award. Technical Services Required: Legal review and analysis to discover and synthesize changes in the legislative environment related to Medicaid benefits for adults, scope of immunization practice by non-physicians, and vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities. (See tasks 2.1) Tasks: The contractor shall: Task 1: Update report on Medicaid immunization benefits for non-institutionalized adults. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the Medicaid report, to include benefits for HPV, zoster, and Tdap vaccines. Data collection will include a survey of state Medicaid directors regarding their future plans for adult immunization benefits and total state expenditures on immunizations for Medicaid beneficiaries. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 2: Update report on state laws covering immunization practice by non-physician providers under their own license or via the use of standing orders. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the standing orders report, to include medical assistants. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 3: Update report on vaccination requirements for staff and residents in long-term care facilities. Within 18 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the long-term care facilities report. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review. Task 4: Update &ldquo;Epidemiology of Immunization Law&rdquo; project website. Within 24 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will update the project website at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/index.cfm to include the updated reports described in the previous tasks. The Contractor will also modify existing graphic depictions of project results (i.e. the Standing Orders Project map) to reflect the findings of the current task order.

<p>Delivery is required to the following address: <br />DLA Information Operations New Cumberland<br />Building 54-2, Door 8, M Avenue<br />New Cumberland, PA 17070</p>
<p>Offeror must be a certified reseller or agent of the manufacturer for the products requested.

<p>DLA Information Operations New Cumberland utilizes Cisco hardware/software for all end-point and boundary routing applications within the agency.

They include the device having a current maintenance agreement with the vendor, the device must not be end of life, and the hardware must run the Internetwork Operating System (IOS) which is only available on Cisco networking peripherals. These restrictions limit requirements for ETN border routers to Cisco brand name equipment only.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order resulting from this notice. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies/services under this contract will be by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Stethoscopes. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this standardization initiative.
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is November 2011</strong>. The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Point of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-3686. <br /></strong>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Stethoscopes. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,877,811.35. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, 138 line items of the total 185 line items represent the top three (3) products and account for 98.68% ($1,853,047.88) of the total volume in sales of $1,877,811.35 in the MMESOs, and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 3 product lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.<br />C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Wendy Sprouse, Clinical Analyst, wendy.a.sprouse.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-3686. The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. <br /></strong>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The <strong>four (4)</strong> requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date indicated. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong>1. Vendor MUST provide a complete line of: Reusable Stethoscopes, that are latex-free, light-weight, single or double tubing design, with antimicrobial coated diaphragm, contoured chest piece with non-chill rim, and self-sealing ear tips, with either a "diaphragm and bell" design or a "large diaphragm/small diaphragm" design and will include at a minimum, the specific products listed below: <br />a. <br />Required Items<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM / BELL OR LARGE DIAPHRAGM / SMALL DIAPHRAGM<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT SINGLE HEAD DIAPHRAGM<br />STETHOSCOPE PEDIATRIC/ INFANT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM / BELL<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Stethoscopes.</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFIAQ with initial submittal. A vendor is required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. <br />c. Vendor should indicate their ability to supply a Sprague-Rappaport-like stethoscope which includes interchangeable chest pieces. Inability to supply this product will not eliminate vendors from this standardization effort.</p>
<p>2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Stethoscopes. Vendor MUST provide DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Stethoscopes or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal<br />4. Vendor MUST submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. <br />Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Selection Process <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Pacific, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given <strong>30 calendar days</strong> from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESOs Pacific and South via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) AND to the rest of the continental United States by appropriate delivery method when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Samples will not be returned). Two (2) samples of each of the stethoscopes listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />Sample Set<br />STETHOSCOPE ADULT DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM/BELL<br />STETHOSCOPE PEDIATRIC DUAL HEAD DIAPHRAGM/ BELL</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate each Stethoscope product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line in a clinical/patient care setting. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) - Completely Unacceptable, two (2) - Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) - Partially Unacceptable, four (4) - Acceptable, and five (5) - Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. <strong>Clinical Requirement #5 will be double weighted. </strong></p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this <br />standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on<br />best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical <br />/performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one <br />score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be <br />combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability <br />evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for <br />final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately eighteen (18) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below: Of note, the clinical/performance requirements are not equally weighted, with clinical requirement #5 (Sound/Acoustical Performance of Device) being double-weighted.</p>
<p>1. (American Heart Association recommendation) (Ergonomics and Clinician Comfort) (Efficiency of Care) The binaurals (the metal portion of the stethoscope onto which the tubing and ear tips are fitted) should be adjustable. This provides comfort and appropriate fit for the clinician, allowing for a more thorough examination. The adjustability of the binaural is important to the comfort and appropriate fit for the clinician, allowing for a more thorough examination.</p>
<p>2. (Ease of Use and Effectiveness) (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01) The stethoscope should have a contoured chest piece so as to provide ease of handling and less slippage. A contoured chest piece allows for greater surface area coverage of the patient's skin, which contributes to better contact, as well as less slippage or sliding of the chest piece against the patient's skin.</p>
<p>3. (Effectiveness &amp; Efficiency of Care) (Device Performance, Medical device Quality Management ISO 13485:2003) The stethoscope should not allow any air leakage from between the diaphragm and the examiner's ears. Any air leakage may interfere with clarity and accuracy of interpretation of sounds.</p>
<p>4. (Device Performance, Medical device Quality Management ISO 13485:2003)<br />The ear tips should be self-sealing and fit securely in the ear/ear canal, reducing ambient noise. Self-sealing ear tips tend to seal against the listener's ear canal to block ambient noise, allowing for more accurate interpretation of sounds.</p>
<p>5. (Double Weighted) (Sound/Acoustical Performance of Device) The stethoscope should provide clarity (the ability to distinguish diagnostic cardiac sounds such as vascular clicks) and loudness (perceived amplitude of the sound), while filtering out noise artifacts (external noise interference). Enhanced clarity and loudness, without external noise interference allows for more accurate interpretation of sounds, which leads to more accurate diagnosis and patient treatment.</p>
<p>6. (Efficiency of Care/Patient Comfort/Safety NPSG.07.05.01) Auscultation of the patient should be able to be accomplished without causing any discomfort or chilling to the patient. The non-chill rim of the stethoscope chest piece prevents patient discomfort during the examination process.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given <strong>30 calendar days</strong> from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00 PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong></p>

<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The surgical sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01)<br />2. The surgical sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />3. The radiopaque material is attached securely to the sponge and is readily visible to the eye.(Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />4. The surgical sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01)<br />5. Any color or dyed part of the surgical sponge does not come off on your gloved hand when the sponge is wet or dry. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />6. The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage)</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. <strong>Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that were identified in Technical Requirements, above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Nasopharyngeal Airways. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong></p>
<p><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Nasopharyngeal Airways. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,855,661.91. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data 15 clustered line items of the total 115 line items, account for 99.25% ($1,841,758.94) of the total volume in sales ($1,855,661.91) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 15 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide <strong>an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>

Airway has smooth rounded edges. The airway should have smooth rounded edges and be soft and flexible to reduce risk of tissue damage to patient. <br />3. Airway facilitates oralpharyngeal suctioning. The evaluator will observe the critical function of suctioning for patient airway maintenance.<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00 PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the supplies listed below. The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00121. This is a 100% small business set-aside.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50, May 16, 2011.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>General Information<br />The Food and Drug Administration/Lab of Immunoregulation requires an imaging system capable of acquiring and analyzing chemiluminescent and fluorescent data from electrophoresis gels and blot membranes from both DNA and protein samples. This data is a critical aspect of our research into HIV envelope structure and function.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Accurate and precise measurement of DNA and protein bands within electrophoresed samples is a critical capability in our research of HIV envelope protein structure and function. Currently, this capability is fulfilled by the use of film. This method however, has many drawbacks, including poor reproducibility and the necessity to transform the data to digital form. This process of transforming the data from film to digital form adds inaccuracy and imprecision to the data. More modern detection methods use imaging instruments with sensitive digital cameras to detect signal from these samples, bypassing the need for an error inducing transformation step and making the detection more efficient by eliminating this step. These instruments house the camera within a light proof box that also contains the appropriate lighting for various types of samples (e.g. broadband UV for ethidium bromide stained DNA samples, narrow band UV or higher wave lengths with filters for excitation of fluorescent probes, white transillumination for coomassie gels).</p>
<p>Scope:<br />Accurate and precise measurement of electrophoretic samples with this instrument will allow the FDA to continue research at a competitive and modern level of technological ability.</p>
<p>Technical performance requirements;<br />The instruments must be capable of accurately and precisely measuring and analyzing signal from the following types of electrophoresed samples:<br />-Western blots stained with chemiluminescent substrates.<br />-Western blots stained with multiple fluorescent probes.<br />-Ethidium bromide stained DNA.<br />-Coomassie stained protein.</p>
<p>The instrument must also have the following features:<br />- Capability to image tissue culture samples within culture dishes.<br />- Capability to prevent the inadvertent stopping of a reading in process by a user attempting to share the instrument (e.g. a door lock). <br />- Capability to change the vertical position of the sample relative to the camera in small increments for optimizing detection (e.g. finely adjustable motorized racking system). <br />- 4MP camera with fast lense (e.g F 0.95 or faster) and ultra low cooling to -28C absolute.<br />- Modular design for easy, inexpensive and flexible addition of fluorochrome detection capabilities including detection of licor 680 and 800 dyes. <br />- Provided with software for acquisition and analysis of data<br />- Provide inside delivery, installation, on-site training, and warranty.</p>
<p>Quotes must include prices for product inclusive of shipping charges.</p>
<p>Contract type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.</p>

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the supplies listed below. The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00122.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50, May 16, 2011.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a revolutionary technology for genomic studies and is being adopted by the biomedical research community and FDA-regulated industries because it is anticipated to play an important role in disease characterization and personalized medicine. However, challenges and pitfalls in the generation, analysis, and interpretation of NGS data are inadequately addressed. In this collaborative SEQC (MAQC III) project on sequencing quality control, technical performance of major NGS platforms will be assessed with mRNA-Seq data to be generated from multiple sites by using the same pair of reference RNA samples previously established by MAQC-I.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the technical performance of the NGS platforms, some built-in truth is necessary for the RNA samples. The External RNA Controls Consortium had been formed to set standards for external controls that could been used to verify technical performance and quality of data from gene expression measurement techniques. One outcome of the ERCC effort is a National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) candidate standard reference material (SRM) containing 96 control sequences. The SRM contains 96 DNA plasmids containing certified sequence. The plasmids inserts generate a set of transcripts, from 250nt to 2000nt in length and containing poly(A) tails, that mimic natural eukaryotic mRNAs.</p>
<p>Requirement:<br />Two complex ERCC RNA control mixes (ERCC RNA Spike-In control Mix 1 and Mix 2). Each mix must contain 92 RNA transcripts and spans over 6 logs of dynamic range with balanced GC content and length. Each mix is further divided into 4 sub-pools that can be utilized to evaluate fold-change measurements of gene expression between the two mixes. These control mixes can be spiked-in to total or poly(A) RNA prior to processing for gene expression studies. <br />To minimize the control mixes lot-to-lot variation, all control mixes (at least 6 micrograms for each mix) need to be produced from a same lot.</p>
<p>Quotes must include prices for product inclusive of shipping charges.</p>
<p>Contract type: Commercial Item-Firm Fixed Price. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.</p>

<p>7.1 Contractor to develop upgraded software and hardware for the Degaussing System, Advanced Model on the USNS LEWIS AND CLARK (T-AKE 1) class of ships. Software and hardware upgrades to include the following:</p>
<p>7.1.1 Contractor to develop upgraded software for the Degaussing System, Advanced Model on the USNS LEWIS AND CLARK (T-AKE 1) class of ships to improve the reliability of the vessels underwater electromagnetic signature during degraded operating conditions.</p>
<p>7.1.1.1 Degraded operating conditions to be defined as and limited to one (1) Bipolar Amplifier Unit (BPAU) offline or in failure mode for any reason on any axis for a total of up to three (3) BPAU's offline or in failure mode at any time.</p>
<p>7.1.1.2 During periods of degraded operating conditions, underwater electromagnetic signature levels of the vessel to meet or exceed OPNAVINST Rev."F" levels.</p>
<p>7.1.1.3 Concept of System Design</p>
<p>System shall be designed to function in a degraded operating condition by automatically compensating for offline or failed BPAUs by controlling the remaining online BPAUs utilizing a unique set of degraded condition calibration constants to minimize the vessels underwater electromagnetic signature. Degraded condition calibration constants are to be developed for each BPAU failure scenario and stored in an array/lookup table in the Degaussing Control Unit (DCU). <br />When operating in a degraded operating condition (DCU senses one (1) or more BPAUs have failed or is offline), a degraded operation alarm will be initiated, the DCU will retrieve a data set pertaining to the specific failure scenario and communicate the new calibration constants to the operational BPAUs keeping the system operating in an automatic Degraded Operation/Compensation Mode.</p>
<p>7.1.1.4 Contractor to develop degraded condition calibration constants and predicted underwater electromagnetic signatures for each BPAU failure scenario.</p>
<p>7.1.1.5 The "Degraded Operation Mode" or "Compensation Mode" alarm to be displayed on the DCU and shall "clearly" indicate when the system is operating in a degraded condition.</p>
<p>7.1.2 Contractor to design/develop an air filtering system for the Bipolar Amplifier Units (BPAUs) of the Degaussing System, Advanced Model on the USNS LEWIS AND CLARK (T-AKE 1) class of ships.</p>
<p>7.1.2.1 Contractor to size and select material for particulate filtering of the cooling air for the BPAUs. Criteria for filter media selection should provide for particulate air filtering commensurate with industry accepted standards for enclosures containing electronic components.</p>
<p>7.1.2.2 Criteria for filter media selection should insure filter media will not adversely affect BPAU enclosure cooling air flow requirements.</p>
<p>7.1.2.3 Contractor to design/develop a method of securing and sealing the particulate air filter media/material to the BPAU enclosure/cooling air fan assembly to prevent particulate infiltration to BPAU enclosure.</p>
<p>7.1.2.4 Method for securing filter media to BPAU enclosure/cooling air fan assembly shall be designed to allow for ease of inspecting and maintaining/changing of filter media.</p>
<p>7.1.3 Contractor to develop upgraded BPAU and DCU software to display internal BPAU temperatures and provide a "High Internal BPAU Temperature" alarm for the Degaussing System, Advanced Model on the USNS LEWIS AND CLARK (T-AKE 1) class of ships.</p>
<p>7.1.3.1 The internal BPAU temperatures are to be individually displayed on the DCU to provide real time feedback and to serve as an indicator of cooling fan operation and/or filter media cleanliness.</p>
<p>7.1.3.2 The "High Internal BPAU Temperature" alarm shall clearly indicate which individual BPAU is in an alarm state.</p>
<p>7.2 Manufacturer's Representative: None required.</p>

<DESC>FLENUMMETOCCEN requires Black Box brand KVM equipment in order to ensure compatibility within our single architecture framework. Several years ago the FLENUMMETOCCEN Network department determined that that Black Box KVM equipment best met the need, best integrated with existing equipment, and represented the best value to the Government among commercially available KVM's.  The consequence of this decision is that we must continue to purchase Black Box KVM equipment as we expand our single architecture framework.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a Brand Name requirement for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number RFQ0061-11 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and should be referenced on all correspondence. The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-50, effective on May 16, 2011. This solicitation is a 100% total small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541519. The small business size standard is $25.0 million dollars. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all contractors to be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to receive contract award or payments. The EEOC intends to make a single award from this solicitation. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The EEOC has a brand name requirement for RightNow Customer Relations Management (CRM) Software Licenses as follows: CLIN 0001: Eighty (80 ea.) RightNow Enterprise Desktop Named User (Part No. ENT-NU): $_______; CLIN 0002: One (1 ea.), Web Portal Sessions - 20,000 Sessions Per Month Block (Part No. WP-SES-20K): $________; CLIN 0003: One (1 ea.), Web Portal (External) Interface (Part No. WPI): $_______; CLIN 0004: One (1 ea.) Preferred Customer Care Package (Part No. PREF-CCP): $_______; CLIN 0005: Twenty-Eight (28 ea.) PrePaid Services/Universal Service Credits (Part No.USC): $_______. TOTAL PRICE TO GOVERNMENT: $______ (CLIN Nos. 0001 thru 0005). This software is a Customer Relations Management (CRM) software tool that allows EEOC to more effectively and efficiently answer calls from the public. The EEOC is currently using the software throughout its Intake Information Group (IIG) to access the EEOC information contained in the knowledgebase and manage customer records. When a call comes into an Information Intake Representative (IIR) located at one of the EEOC fifteen (15) offices that support the IIG, the IIR utilizes customer relations management software to access information about the EEOC and the laws the agency enforce, as well as to enter and track information about callers. More than 90,000 calls come into the agency each month. The software is a hosted solution that allows each EEOC IIR to enter the information remotely and management to run reports utilizing the information collected by the IIR. Because EEOC owned the licenses, and the licenses were supported, when EEOC hired 61 Intake Information Representatives (IIRs) in late February 2008 they were trained in the use of the RightNow software. EEOC requires a one year renewal for its current 80 RightNow licenses. By having customer relations management software for one year, it will allow for maintenance and upgrade support for the software licenses purchased as well as provide technical support for the agency's current RightNow CRM application. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance for the software licenses will be for one year. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: EEOC fifteen (15) designated offices which support the IIG. The quoter shall include the following with their quote: Part I: The quoter shall provide a price and description of all CLINs (0001 thru 0005) with the total price. Part II: The name, title, telephone number, fax number and email address of the point of contact. Part III: The nine digit DUNS and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code with their quote. All contractors who provide goods/services to the EEOC must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR): http://www.ccr.gov. PART IV: Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3 or an online representations and certification application (ORCA) record must be submitted with the quote. On line Certifications and Representations is available at: http://orca.bpn.gov. Failure to comply with the ORCA registration may deem quoter ineligible for award. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be made based on best value using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach. The evaluation of quotations shall be on a GO or No-Go basis and will occur in two sequential stages: Technical evaluation determines whether quotations are technically acceptable or unacceptable, followed by a price evaluation. GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows: 1) Authorized RightNow Reseller: Standards: The vendor must provide evidence that it is an authorized RightNow reseller for the required licenses. The vendor must provide a corporate line card that clearly states this information for verification or the vendor must provide a website where this information is available. 2) Period of Performance: Standards: The vendor must demonstrate they can provide the licenses from June 22, 2011 thru June 21, 2012. The vendor must provide a written statement with their quote indicating that the vendor can provide the required licenses from June 22, 2011 thru June 21, 2012. 3) Experience on Similar Contracts: Standards: The quoter must provide evidence that it has successfully performed a minimum of three (3) contracts for the same or similar services within the past (2) years to include contract type, contract number, contract value, point of contact name and telephone number, and the type of service provided. NO-GO: An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies. The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. Once the quotes have been determined technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price. All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC. The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses are applicable: FAR Provisions: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR Clauses: FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items: 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside; 52.222-3, Convict Labor; 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52,222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons; 52.223-18 Contractor Policy to Ban Text Messaging While Driving; 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, 52.233-3, Protest After Award; and 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim; and FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is 100% set aside for small businesses. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) code for the procurement is 334516 and the Small Business size standard is 500 employees. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center Contracting Office, has a requirement for a FTIR portable spectrometer.     <br><br>BID SCHEDULE:<br>Line Item 0001-FTIR Portable Spectrometer  Qty 1   Unit Price:_______  <br>                                                               Total Amount_______<br>Delivery: (FOB Destination) Please include shipping in line item pricing and an estimated delivery period.<br>	<br>        U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <br>	Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)<br>	Topographic Engineering Center (TEC)<br>        7701 Telegraph Road<br>  	Alexandria, Virginia 22315-3864<br><br>Specifications:<br>The remote sensing team of ERDC Alexandria is coalescing their field testing and ground validation of VIS/SWIR remote sensing with TIR investigations.  The group is currently involved in VIS and SWIR hyperspectral reflectance applications for identifying, tracking, locating materials, and change detection, among other applications between the 0.35 and 2.5  m wavelength region.  However, the nature of this work has justified the need for an FTIR portable spectrometer that can extend our spectral coverage from 2.5 to 15  m, a common wavelength region for studying natural surface materials such as rocks and soils.  This instrument will increase our ability to discriminate between earth and non-earth-based materials, and monitor transient spectral behaviors under various environmental conditions, with increased accuracy.<br><br>The nature of this work has justified the need for a lightweight and easily portable instrument that can maintain at least 4 hours of continuous operation, and does not require liquid nitrogen or desiccant packs that would hinder the team's mobility in remote field experiments.  The system must be controlled by a PDA system via Bluetooth, and a cable connection must also be an option for lightweight portability.  The system should also be controllable by a laptop computer via cable and Bluetooth that can also allow us to conduct indoor laboratory data collection and analysis.  Other requirements for the spectrometer include:  software that allows for spectral library creation, instrument optimization to collect data in Diffuse Reflectance mode (complementary to the VIS/SWIR data), and a one-handed configuration to allow the user to hold on to a support structure on rough terrain while advancing through software, concomitantly.<br><br><br><br>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.<br><br><br>The following provisions apply to this acquisition: <br>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items<br>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certification - Commercial Items <br>52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items<br>52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items <br>52.216-6 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside<br>52.219-28 Post Award Small Business Program Representation<br>52.222-3 Convict labor<br>52.222-19 Child Labor - Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies <br>52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities<br>52.222-26 Equal Opportunity<br>52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-CCR<br>252.225-7001 Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program <br><br>NOTE: ALL OFFERORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION (CCR) BEFORE BEING ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION FOR AWARD. Information concerning CCR requirements may be viewed via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423.<br><br>Interested parties must include, with their quote, their CAGE code and a completed 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certification or state that the offeror has completed Offeror Representations and Certification.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br /></span></strong>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that United States Coast Guard (USCG) procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Ombudsman for Agency Protests.</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3695 or Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This project seeks to assess the feasibility of collecting VA pain data derived from ED encounters.  Evergreen Design will be involved with work associated with the project's specific aims 2a, 2b, and 3.  These are stated below:
2.	To explore sources and types of data required to extract (future) processes of pain care measures using ELECTRONIC ABSTRACTION of data from VHA sources (SA2) by:
a.	Identifying alternate data sources of Veteran ED pain care from local (X), regional (Y), and national (Z) VHA sources. (SA2a)
b.	Identifying the data types available (whether as structured or free text information) and how to efficiently and effectively access them. (SA2b)
3.	To provide recommendations on improving/modifying/structuring VHA data for accurate and consistent electronic abstraction of process of pain care data (e.g., implementing templates for missing data). (SA3)

	The VA has an evolving array of electronic databases that can be used as possible data sources for this project.  The work will involve determining which of these databases should be used to supply the list of variables as shown in the project's write-up (Table 2.)

Once these variables have been better understood, they will be sought via the relevant national datasets (Austin, RDW, CDW, etc).  A local SQL Server database will be established to manage and process these extracted variables.  The project work will also consist of generating report documents describing the results of the data extraction process, data quality, data types found, and recommendations in support of an automated pain data abstraction process.

Summary of Work
"	Review of existing VA electronic data sources relevant to this project. The review will cover local, regional, and national datasets
"	Establishing a project SQL Database for analysis of extracted data elements
"	Extraction and analysis of project data elements from each data source

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Sponges. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. Vendor is not required to quote for each MMESO AOR. Vendor will be required to identify in initial response for which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes. <strong>The Government will make a single selection for each of the following MMESO AORs</strong>:</p>
<p>1<strong>. MMESO North</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. MMESO South</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. MMESO West</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. MMESO Pacific</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. MMESO Europe</strong></p>
<p>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR) for which a quote is submitted, i.e., Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection for each MMESO AOR. <strong>Point of Contact: Ricardo Orias,MMESO West Team Leader, Ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8537; Cindy Ingrao, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cynthia.ingrao.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-8517;Cheryl Janus, MMESO West Clinical Analyst, Cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil,(619) 532-7554.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Sponges. Within The MMESO West estimated total annual demand for this product line is approximately $977,002 based on PV usage data over 12 months of recent usage. Estimated annual demand per Area of Responsibility is approximately MMESO North: $126,609; MMESO South: $523,972; MMESO West: $110,205; MMESO Europe: $103,958; and MMESO Pacific: $112,258. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, the top twenty one (21) lines items of the total sixty two (62) line items, account for 81.3% ($794,361) of the total volume in sales ($977,002) in the MMESOs, and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 21 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ricardo Orias, MMESO West Team Leader, ricardo.orias.ctr@med.navy.mil, Ms. Cindy Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, cynthia.ingrao.ctr.@med.navy.mil and Ms. Cheryl Janus, Clinical Analyst, cheryl.janus.ctr@med.navy.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding and (4) Identification of which MMESO AOR(s) vendor intends to submit pricing for. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO West that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO West via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>Vendors who do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for each MMESO AOR based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR. The MMESO West reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. Vendors must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Vendors who do not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. The vendors who meet the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The four (4) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Surgical Sponges products that includes at a minimum the specific products identified below for Surgical Sponges: sterile, woven, latex free, and contain an integrated radiopaque indicator, and will include at a minimum:<br />a. <br />GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />* Operational usage items are included in this list of Surgical Sponges</p>
<p>b. Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufacture and/or distribute by brands and descriptions) via excel sheet, and product catalog &amp; literature in response to this RFAIQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as stated above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Surgical Sponges product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendors without a DAPA number or those that have not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />3. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Medical/Surgical prime vendors for each MMESO AOR for which a quote is submitted, i.e. Cardinal Health and/or Owens &amp; Minor for Surgical Sponges or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who have not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />4. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.)<br />5. Vendor must identify with initial submittal which MMESO AOR(s) they intend to submit quotes for. Vendor will not have an opportunity to change MMESO AOR(s) during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.</p>
<p>Phase II Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Evaluation <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO West, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. <strong>Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span> Vendor must send the MMESO West verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). Two (2) packages of each size and configuration of products listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>GAUZE SPONGE, X-RAY DETECTABLE, 4" X 8", 12 PLY, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 4x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE<br />LAPAROTOMY SPONGE, XRAY DETECTABLE, 18x18in, W/O RINGS, STERILE</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. Each evaluator will evaluate product samples from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)- Completely Unacceptable, two (2)- Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)- Partially Unacceptable, four (4)- Acceptable, and five (5)- Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO West, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately nineteen (19) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. The surgical sponge does not lint/release fragments of material. (Patient Safety - NPSG #7 - 07.05.01)<br />2. The surgical sponge is composed of a soft and absorbable material. (Patient Safety/Comfort - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />3. The radiopaque material is attached securely to the sponge and is readily visible to the eye.(Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />4. The surgical sponge is durable and does not fray. (Patient Safety - NPSG-7.05.01)<br />5. Any color or dyed part of the surgical sponge does not come off on your gloved hand when the sponge is wet or dry. (Patient Safety - NPSG 07.05.01)<br />6. The package is easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. (Patient Safety and Efficiency of Usage)<br /><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO West and must be received by 5:00 PM PST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in that MMESO AOR.<strong> Vendor quotes will contain separate pricing for each MMESO AOR(s) that were identified in Technical Requirements, above. Vendor is not required to provide a quote for each MMESO AOR.</strong> The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is issuing a Request For Proposal (RFP) intending to negotiate Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity, fixed price contracts (base and four one year option periods) for the procurement of small scale safety testing, thermal stability examination, and explosive characterization such as diameter effect/critical diameter testing of various improvised explosives for the FBI. Improvised explosives consist of suitable combinations of fuels and oxidizers (either as physical mixtures or incorporated at the molecular level) that can have energetic potential. Tests previously performed have included measurements of the safety, hazards, thermal stability, stability, and explosive performance characteristics of these energetic materials. Safety and hazard characterization of improvised explosives provides crucial information regarding their safe handling and manufacturing. Performance characterization experiments test the explosive in a variety of scenarios to determine its explosive potential and quantify its energy release. Contractors proposing on this solicitation will be required to submit pricing and procedures with their proposal as required in the attached solicitation.
<p>The RFP# LDQ004270 is being issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. This RFP is being conducted as an unrestricted procurement. This solicitation is attached and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the Federal Government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In addition, interested parties must also be registered and have completed the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Information and registration details can be found at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>All Questions&nbsp;must be emailed to Jacob Gessel at Jacob.Gessel@IC.FBI.GOV before 11:00AM EST June 2, 2011. Any questions received after this date may not be answered.<br /><br />Proposal delivery date is extended until July 8, 2011 at 11:00AM EST, this due to the revised SOW that was attached to the SOW. Revised SOW - 3 is now the correct SOW to refer to in responding to the RFP, replacing the attached SOW included in&nbsp;the RFP Attachments.</p>

The RFP due date is changed to July 8, 2011 at 11:00AM EST, and question due date is unchanged but questions may still be emailed in though may not be ansered. Additionally all questions must be emailed to <a href="mailto:jacob.gessel@ic.fbi.gov">jacob.gessel@ic.fbi.gov</a> no questions will be answered over the phone.<br /><br />Additionally a revised SOW -3 has been attached and replaces the previous SOW.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>FAR clause 52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) ADDENDUM:&nbsp; Paragraph (c) is hereby deleted.&nbsp;<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:&nbsp; Technical approach and Past PErformance.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Technical approach and past performance are more important than price.</strong> <br /><br />(b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA 2011 Field Management Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JULY 17, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JULY 22, 2011 (Date of Departure)
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of our agency is critically linked to our ability to align our program or individual office goals with the strategic goals of the SBA. For an organization of our size, our managers and frontline leaders must work in concert and not cross-purposes. We've already begun this process by having our frontline leaders work collaboratively with their program department counterparts to identify critical skills and develop training materials that are relevant for both sides. We'd like to build on that momentum by utilizing our time in Tampa/St. Petersburg, Florida to gain a shared understanding of SBA's strategic plan and how our 2012 district office and program department goals will be informed by the plan.</p>
<p>The goals of the conference are:</p>
<p>1. To identify, share and begin to implement customer service best practices across the agency.<br />2. To examine and identify the customer and partner experience with the agency's programs and services.<br />3. Identify ways to strengthen our customer service while managing performance across all of our field management units.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Field Management Conference is aimed at SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, July 17th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, July 18th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive on&nbsp;Monday, July 18th. The conference shall begin at lunchtime on Monday, July 18th.&nbsp; Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 7:00 am to 9:00 am to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 150 participants. Likewise, SBA may need four smaller work rooms to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, all rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference; therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 150 adults. The four meeting rooms shall be required to comfortably accommodate 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $92/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only. One upgraded guest room is requested to be provided at the Government approved rate of $92/night and must be large enough to accommodate small informal meetings of 10-12 people. The total estimated number of guest rooms needed per night is:</p>
<p><br />DATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # OF ROOMS<br />17-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20<br />18-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />19-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />20-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />21-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150<br />22-Jul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Departure</p>
<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to and after the scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>
<p>A hotel airport shuttle service is preferred; however if no shuttle service is provided, the hotel will provide information on other airport transportation options.</p>
<p>Food and beverage service must meet Federal Government's per diem rates. Presentation of food should be visually appealing, colorful, and offer a good variety of nutritional value and selection at each meal and snack. Government meals for breakfast, lunch and breaks are directed and provided to all SBA employees during the training events. Employees' meal per diem allowance will be reduced for all government provided meals. All meals/food/beverage costs are not to exceed the federal governments'&nbsp;Tampa/St Petersburg&nbsp;per diem rates ($8 - breakfast, $12 - lunch) per day&nbsp;excluding service charges. Meals will be served (either buffet style or plated) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>
<p>Fast and easy check-in and check-out capabilities are required. With 150 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently. Luggage storage is required if guestrooms are not available for early check-in (11:00 am arrival). The hotel shall allow confirmed guest reservations to arrive up until 11:00 pm of the first day. SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>
<p>The front desk shall be prepared to provide basic information on the proximity of outside dining establishments as the group will likely be released nightly to enjoy dinner outside of the event facility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>1. Attachment 1 Specifications</p>
<p>Submission of Invoices (April 2011)</p>
<p><br />(a) Background: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) partners with the United States Coast Guard Finance Center for financial services in support of TSA operations, including the payment of contractor invoices. Therefore, all contractor invoices must be submitted to, and will be paid by, the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center (FinCen).</p>
<p>(b) Invoice Submission Method: Invoices may be submitted via facsimile, U.S. Mail, or email. Contractors shall utilize ONLY ONE method per invoice submission. The submission information for each of the methods is as follows in order of preference:</p>
<p>1) Facsimile number is: 757-413-7314</p>
<p>The facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only. If facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail. It is the responsibility of the contractor to verify that invoices are received, regardless of the method of submission used. Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>2) U.S. Mail: <br />United States Coast Guard Finance Center <br />TSA Commercial Invoices <br />P.O. Box 4111 <br />Chesapeake, VA 23327-4111</p>
<p>3) Email Invoices: <br />FIN-SMB-TSAInvoices@uscg.mil or www.fincen.uscg.mil<br /><br />(c) Invoice Process: Upon receipt of contractor invoices, FinCen will electronically route invoices to the appropriate TSA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and/or Contracting Officer for review and approval. Upon approval, the TSA will electronically route the invoices back to FinCen. Upon receipt of certified invoices from an Authorized Certifying Official, FinCen will initiate payment of the invoices.</p>
<p>Note for discounts offered:</p>
<p>Discounts on invoices. If desired, the Contractor should offer discounts directly upon the invoice submitted, clearly specifying the terms of the discount. Contractors can structure discounted amounts for payment for any time period less than the usual thirty day payment period specified under Prompt Payment requirements; however the Contractor should not structure terms for payment of net amounts invoiced any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>
<p><br />Discounts offered after invoice submission. If the Contractor should wish to offer a discount on a specific invoice after its submission for payment, the Contractor should submit a letter to the Finance Center identifying the specific invoice for which a discount is offered and specify the exact terms of the discount offered and what time period the Government should make payment by in order to receive the discount. The Contractor should clearly indicate the contract number, invoice number and date, and the specific terms of the discount offered. Contractors should not structure terms for net amount payments any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>
<p>(d) Payment Status: Contractors may inquire on the payment status of an invoice by any of the following means:</p>
<p>(1) Via the internet: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil <br />Contacting the FinCen Customer Service Section via telephone at 1-800-564-5504 or (757) 523-6940 (Voice Option #1). The hours of operation for the Customer Service line are 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. However, the Customer Service line has a voice-mail feature that is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.</p>
<p>(2) Via the Payment Inquiry Form: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil/secure/payment.htm</p>
<p>(e) Invoice Elements: Invoices will automatically be rejected if the information required in subparagraph (a)(2) of the Prompt Payment Clause, contained in this Section of the Contract, including EFT banking information, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and DUNS number are not included in the invoice. All invoices must clearly correlate invoiced amounts to the corresponding contract line item number and funding citation. The Contractor shall work with the Government to mutually refine the format, content and method of delivery for all invoice submissions during the performance of the Contract.</p>
<p>(f) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen. Supplemental invoice documentation required for review and approval of invoices may, at the written direction of the Contracting Officer, be submitted directly to either the Contracting Officer, or the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.</p>

(End of clause)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman - Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman - Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote which shall be considered by the agency.<br />Contact Wade Huston at Wade.C.Huston@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation. All questions must be received at this e-mail address no later than June 15, 2011, 3:00 P.M., EST.<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is June 17, 2011, 3:00 P.M., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about June 21, 2011. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail or at the following address: <br />USCG Air Station Elizabeth City<br />Supply, Hangar 49<br />Attn: SK1 Huston<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>

In regards to questions, the following answers are provided to all interested parties:

Question:  I was wondering who the current service provider is and the current pricing structure?

Answer:  The current provider Flood Brothers, Chicago Illinois.  

There are two Contract Line items that require pricing, one for the weekly pick-up, and the other is for cleaning and sanitizing.  This is a firm fixed price requirement.

Question:   Do you have any historical volume for the compactor?  
 
Answer:  No.  A weekly pick-up will suffice.

Question:  Would you prefer a haul rate plus disposal rate per ton?  

Answer:  No.

<DESC>Amendment 002 is issued to clarify the instructions to Offerors under Technical Quotations, beginning on page 20 of the solicitation, among other administrative amendments, see Attached Amendment, pdf file.

Question:  

The pricing format in B.3 Schedule of Services/Pricing Schedule only includes line items for the Base year of the contract. Since this is potentially a five year contract, I was wondering how we submit pricing for the following four years?  It is typical for this industry to have 3-5% increases each year. 

Answer:  

Under the description of the agreement, paragraph eight (8) stated a five year agreement; a base year does not apply.  At the BPA establishment level, Please note that this is an agreement, vise a binding contract.  Amendment 002 clarifies base year by removing the statement under the addendum to FAR 52.212.1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items.  The VA does have recurring needs to remove and clean this trash compactor which is intended to cover the entire performance period shown in paragraph 8 of the description of agreement.        

Question:

Also, in Description of Agreement section 4.1 that any price increases must be have documentation and be approved by the Contracting Officer Are there any guarantees on price increases? I am asking this because I am aware of the price increases we will face from our team subcontractor and must account for those in our pricing structure.

Answer: 

In regards to price increases, and since amendment 002 is issued to clarify that a base year does not apply, it is assumed that Offerors will submit their prices for a five year period, including the opportunity to submit a price increase in writing.  This procurement is not considered complex, and any price increase will be considered based on the written request received by the contracting officer.  The initial price is considered based on competition, and other techniques, and future price increases can be based on factual industry data, that is typically used by the Government, as well as industry.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Engineering/Technical Service for the <br />Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) <br />in support of the Minuteman Weapon Systems <br />at Hill Air Force Base, Utah</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research. The Government intends to establish a continuous engineering/technical service contract for the Strategic Missile Integration Complex (SMIC) in support of the Minuteman Weapon Systems at Hill Air Force Base, Utah.</p>
<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing a Justification and Approval document to gain the required approval to issue a sole source request for proposal to The Boeing Company. For all test equipment at the SMIC, the contractor shall provide system level sustainment engineering, maintenance, and, upon request, operate the test equipment (e.g. Squadron Data Simulator (SDS), Missile Guidance Set (MGS), Guidance &amp; Control Laboratory Test Stand (GCLTS), Ground Test Signal Conditioner (GTSC), SMIC Data Acquisition System (SMIC DAS), Test Buffer Unit (TBU), Site Monitoring System, fully operational Minuteman Launch Facilities (LF) with ground test missiles, fully operational Minuteman Launch Control Centers (LCC), Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC) ground test station, and Wing Code Processor). The contractor will conduct testing, develop test plans, test directives, and standard operating procedures, design and/or develop upgrades to test stands, fabricate test fixtures, perform repair and troubleshooting as needed, perform and document data analysis, and provide other support (contractor acquired property, configuration management, hazardous waste management, MILSTRIP, commercial of the shelf purchasing and licensing, etc.) as required in fulfillment of this contract.</p>
<p>Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The Boeing Company is the only currently qualified source for the engineering/technical services identified hereunder. Boeing has the intimate knowledge of the ICBM weapon system, classified and unclassified ICBM specification requirements, and SMIC unique test equipment and methods.</p>
<p>Subject to the Government's consideration, a viable source, not already qualified to provide the requisite services, should submit a concise and program specific response presenting sufficient information to substantiate that they have (1) the necessary knowledge and understanding of the requirements; 2) facilities and employees with satisfactory qualifications; and appropriate management, and engineering experience with the ICBM and/or similar ICBM program to be able to conduct the engineering/technical services requirement without technical, schedule or cost risk. In addition, any viable sources, not currently qualified, will conduct a demonstration of capability prior to award of contract. The response shall describe the potential offeror's qualifications in the following areas: (1) ICBM Programs. Describe current and past Minuteman programs conducted by the potential offeror and relevance to the services described herein. Describe knowledge of and experience with ICBM system level testing utilizing Squadron Data Simulator (SDS), Missile Guidance Set (MGS), Guidance &amp; Control Laboratory Test Stand (GCLTS), Ground Test Signal Conditioner (GTSC), SMIC Data Acquisition System (SMIC DAS), Test Buffer Unit (TBU), Site Monitoring System, fully operational Minuteman Launch Facilities (LF) with ground test missiles, fully operational Minuteman Launch Control Centers (LCC), Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC) ground test station, and Wing Code Processor. (2) Management System. Describe the management approach to be employed on the program. (3) Personnel Experience. Describe the qualifications of personnel projected to work on this program. Management, engineering, and technical personnel should have experience on ICBM and /or similar program, including the details of those programs/contracts worked. (4) Facilities. Describe those facilities to be proved to the contractor's personnel to encourage optimum performance on the required tasks. (5) Demonstration of Capability. Describe the plan (and schedule), prior to contract award, that demonstrates the potential offeror's capability to perform all tasks required. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Air Force will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.</p>
<p>A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted by 10 March 2011 to AFNWC/PKMA, ATTN: Kirk Dean, 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258 Room 25, Hill AFB UT 84056-5816, or kirk.dean@hill.af.mil. No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.</p>

The goal is to award between 4 and 6 multiple-year IDIQ Task Order contracts for construction services for the Tongass National Forest and possibly the Chugach National Forest Service located in the state of Alaska. The minimum guarantee is $5,000.00 per contract over the life of each contract. Task Order minimum and maximum limits are $2,000.00 and $4,500,000.00 respectively.

Under Required Standard Features Specification:  Vehicle Securement Points (to stabilize device in vehicle) As outlined in RESNA test methods for wheelchairs:  Supplement 10 to Volume 1 - 1998.

-Our company will be providing power wheelchairs under the bid to be compliant with the above specification, which will include four factory installed transport brackets, a wheelchair anchored pelvic belt, and the WC19 required labeling on the wheelchair frame and belts, tested to the bids' "required standard features and performance standards."  

QUESTION:

Is it correct that offerors are not required to test every possible configuration with the bids' "required options," some of which are considered add-on equipment.  

RESPONSE: Correct. Similar question has prior been answered. Device testing is not required for all possible configurations.

-Due to patient safety/liability issues, our company does not offer the four factory installed transport brackets, wheelchair anchored pelvic belt, and WC19 required labeling on power chair configurations that have not been crash tested, as these features give the impression that the power chair is intended to be occupied in a moving vehicle and that it has been tested and proven safe in the event of a crash.  Rather, our company's standard commercial practice is to offer four factory installed transport brackets and a basic seat positioning strap for configurations (such as those included in any of the VA's "required options") that have "not" been crash tested to the WC19 standard.  

QUESTIONS:

For the power wheelchairs with "required options" in the bid that are not crash tested to the above referenced specification:  

1.	Do you still require four factory installed transport brackets?  If you do, we request that this be incorporated into the bids' "required option" specifications as currently there is no place to include a different model number for factory installed transport brackets that have not been crash tested.

2.	In addition, due to patient safety/liability issues, we must include a seat positioning strap.  We request this to be incorporated into the bids' "required option" specifications, as currently there is no place to include a different model number for a non-crash tested seat positioning strap.


RESPONSE:  All models submitted for technical evaluation in response to the solicitation must be tested to WC-19 standards as clearly outlined.  If the device submitted has not been "crash tested", it should not be submitted.  It is not appropriate to provide transport brackets or a "seat positioning strap" that has not been tested to WC-19 standards.



_____________________________________________________________________________







We are requesting more detailed product sample instructions be provided to offerors?

Based on the VA's previous bid for power wheelchairs required sample submission, we are making the following similar recommendation for product sample submission.

QUESTIONS:


1.	 Request offerors to provide three sample wheelchairs for each Award group chair submitted.

2.	 Assume a rider that is 5 feet 10 inches tall and 175 lbs. in weight for all sample chairs submitted so that they are programmed equally.

3.	Inform offerors under what conditions each sample wheelchair will be tested to, so that they can be programmed for optimal performance.  For example, sample wheelchair #1 could be programmed for aggressive outdoor use, sample wheelchair #2 programmed for indoor use, etc.

 Recommended Sample wheelchair #1 submission - Standard Configuration
- Configured with all required standard features only
- Seat sizes should be appropriate for hypothetical rider

Recommended Sample wheelchair #2 submission - Rehab Configuration
- Configured with the following required options only.  All items not listed below should default to the required standard features.
	Back support with adjustable back canes
	Solid seat
	Elevating leg rests
	Swing away joystick mount
- Seat size should be appropriate for hypothetical rider

Recommended Sample wheelchair #3 submission - Power Elevating Seat Configuration
- Configured with the following required options only.  All items not listed below should default to the required standard features.
	Solid seat (with standard back support)
	Power elevating seat
	Swing away leg rests (non-elevating)
	Foot support, standard length, flip up 
	Desk length arms

RESPONSE:  One device is to be submitted for technical evaluation; it is not acceptable to submit more than one example of the same model.  The power chair programmer must be provided with the submission. In addition to live technical evaluation of the product submitted, the RESNA test report will be reviewed relative to all specifications and performance parameters. 


-In addition, we recommend the following items be provided individually, but not installed on every wheelchair:
- Oxygen cylinder holder
- Cane/crutch holder
- Walker holder

RESPONSE: Yes, the above items are to be provided individually; but not installed on every wheelchair.

-We believe the above product samples and add-on options demonstrate all required standard features and required options with the exception of those specifications that have multiple offerings within  the specification, such as seat widths and depths, back heights, seat to floor heights, colors etc.
 
Also we recommend that any additional seat widths and depths voluntarily being provided by an offeror, that are not a mandatory under "required standard features" or "required options," be excluded from sample submission and be referenced in the descriptive product literature only. 

RESPONSE:  yes, acceptable to reference additional seat sized in product literature.

_________________________________________________________________________________
-Per the VA's response, it is okay for offerors to voluntarily submit additional seat widths and depths under "Required Standard Features" as well as additional "solid" seat widths and depths for the "Seat -Solid"  under the "Required Options" as long as there is no price differential.  Also the response stated that there are no evaluation factors that account for availability of more seat sizes than the minimum indicated.  

QUESTIONS:

If an offeror is going to voluntarily submit additional seat widths and depths under these two specifications:

1.	Should they be itemized and included in the submission/offer with model numbers, descriptions and descriptive product literature, even though they will not be included in evaluation factors?  

RESPONSE: Yes.  Include these details.

2.	Should they be included in the product sample submission, even though they will not be included in evaluation factors, or just referenced in the descriptive product literature only?  

RESPONSE: Referenced only, no need to include with sample submission.

3.	Should they be included in the Schedule of Supplies, under the appropriate item no. with unit price, but excluded from the estimated total price, since there will be no price differential?  

RESPONSE: Yes, they should be included in the Schedule of supplies, under the appropriate item no. with unit price, but excluded from the estimated total price.

We are looking for SDVOSB general contractors with a minimum of five years experience primarily in HVAC as well as a working knowledge on all other trades.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220- Commercial and Institutional Building Construction; and the small business standard is $33.5M.
