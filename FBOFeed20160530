In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>
<p>1. El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) personnel screening requirement<br />2. Base/Repair Facility Access Request<br />3. Vehicle Access Request<br />4. Ship Access List (vendor-provided)</p>
<p>All forms are available for download on the MSC contracts webpage at http://www.msc.navy.mil. Click on "Contracts" in the upper right corner. "EPIC template" is under "Reference" subheading. Click on "Online Library of Common Documents" for all other forms.</p>
<p>EPIC: Required for access to MSC vessels. Complete EPIC form strictly adhering to format requirements and forward to (CONUS East Coast repairs) msc.norfolk.epic@navy.mil and (CONUS West Coast and HI repairs) MSC.SSUSD.EPIC@NAVY.MIL. EPIC personnel screening requests are desired seven calendar days prior to performance start date. Requests will be managed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Vendor will be notified by MSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>
<p>Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities. Follow supplemental instructions on Base Access forms or base-specific vehicle access forms.</p>
<p>Ship Access List* (Vendor-Provided): On company letterhead attachment via email, the vendor is required to provide the ship master (courtesy copy the Port Engineer) with an accurate, current list of performing personnel prior to being admitted aboard the vessel. Under no circumstances will a hand-delivered list be accepted.</p>
<p><br />WOOD PACKAGING MATERIAL (WPM) - ADDITIONAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15, the following commercial heat treatment process has been approved by the American Lumber Standards Committee (ALSC) and is required for all Wood Packaging Material (WPM). WPM is defined as wood pallets, skids, load boards, pallet collars, wooden boxes, reels, dunnage, crates, frames, and cleats. Packaging materials exempt from the requirements are materials that have undergone a manufacturing process such as corrugated fiberboard, plywood, particleboard, veneer and oriented strand board. All WPM shall be constructed from Heat Treated (HT to 56 degrees Centigrade for 30 minutes) lumber and certified by an accredited agency recognized by the ALSC in accordance with Wood Packaging Material Policy and Wood Packaging Material Enforcement Regulations (see URL: http://www.alsc.org). All materials must include certification markings in accordance with ALSC standards and be placed in an unobstructed area that will be readily visible to inspectors. Pallet markings shall be applied to the stringer or block on diagonally opposite sides and ends of the pallet and be contrasting and clearly visible. All dunnage used in configuring and/or securing the load shall also comply with ISPM 15 and be marked with an ALSC approved "DUNNAGE" stamp. Failure to comply with the requirements of this restriction may result in refusal, destruction, or treatment of materials at the point of entry.</p>

<CONTACT>Andrew T. Rothstein, Email RothsteinAT@state.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Request for Information (RFI) <br />for<br />Department of State</p>
<p>PURPOSE: This Request for Information (RFI) is issued as market research to determine the capability of&nbsp;<strong>HUBZone ONLY</strong> contractors support the Department of State's (DOS) domestic telecommunications requirements, which includes telecommunications services at all locations supported by the Telecommunications, Wireless, and Data Division (TWD). The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse any costs associated with the preparation of responses. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responses to this RFI will assist DOS in determining the potential level of interest, competition adequacy, and technical capabilities of HUBZone contractors to provide the required products and services. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: TWD currently receives approximately 900 work orders for installations, removals and changes each month (each port location is counted as a work order and individual service requests will contain from one to hundreds of port changes). Not all work orders require cabling or other services noted in this RFI. All changes in service involving installations, relocations, disconnections, moves, changes, such as station installations, removals, rearrangements or feature changes and system administration are accomplished under work orders prepared and processed by other contractors. Based on requirements listed on specific work orders, the primary work activities for the contractor will be the installation and service of telecommunication cable infrastructure and the procurement of equipment and supplies. The contractor will be responsible for the procurement of all materials used by TWD and shall work with other contractor staff and Government Full-time Employees (FTE) as an integrated team that performs its required activities as part of a unified workflow used to respond to customers' requests for telecommunications services. As such, the contractor for this procurement must accept, coordinate, and process any equipment or materials procurement requirements under these work orders in a timely and expeditious manner, even if the materials will be installed or used by other contractors or Government staff.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS: The Government requires the Contractor to perform its assigned duties in support all of TWD's (domestic) telecommunications services to all TWD's customers. The scope of this potential contract will include installation of equipment (e.g., UPS, Wi-Fi and power conditioning equipment telecommunications racks and cabinets); cabling and conduit design, installation, and testing of cable infrastructure; warranty and maintenance support for network infrastructure; program and project management; key personnel support; management of cleared warehouse space; procurement support; and business and financial administration. <br />High-Level Requirements:</p>
<p>Please note that the Government is aware that these are high-level requirements and subject to change. The RFP, if issued, will include more detailed requirements.<br />1. Procurement Support</p>
<p>TWD needs to change the current business process for procuring telecommunications equipment and supplies. This contract is in support of an effort that seeks to:</p>
<p>a. Reduce the price DOS pays for voice and data telecommunications and networking equipment, maintenance, and ancillary supplies<br />b. Establish credible and ongoing relationships with select reseller(s) to improve customer service and general operational efficiencies<br />c. Minimize risk by ensuring reseller(s) have effective supply chain risk management systems<br />d. Streamline the nature in which equipment is currently purchased and maintained<br />e. Enable future technological, process, and acquisition efficiencies <br />f. The contract will require the selected contractor(s) to process any equipment requirements for these work orders in a timely and expeditious manner. The contractor will review the Bill of Materials (BOM)/Order to validate correctness of line items, configuration, and component compatibility with other BOM items and the DOS network. The contractor's procurement specialists will need to be familiar with Telecommunications and IT equipment so that they can bring any discrepancies to the attention of DOS for resolution</p>

<DESC><p><br />III. Inquiry</p>
<p>Question 1: This solicitation appears to be for interior construction of the secure portions of the facility that require Facility Clearance Level (FCL) and Safeguarding capability granted by the Defense Security Service (DSS) at the SECRET level, and therefore a subset of a broader scope of work (larger budget magnitude) included in a prior 2014 solicitation that was later cancelled. Has there been a procurement for construction of the uncleared portions of the facility as a separate project or is that procurement happening in parallel through a different solicitation?</p>
<p>I did see in the Federal Procurement Data System that a contract was awarded in January 2016 to HYUNDAI ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LIMITED (contract # W912UM16C0001). I'm wondering if the scope of that contract was for construction of the building shell, framework, and areas that do not require SECRET clearance? Or did it also include building systems such as generators, chillers, air handlers, building automation, fire alarm, fire protection, physical security in the unsecure areas? Is there to be a third solicitation for the technical systems to be installed in these areas of the facility?</p>
<p>&bull; Answer 1: The procurement for the non-secure portion has already been awarded and included a majority of the building systems.</p>
<p>Question 2: If they are two separate projects, will there be coordination required between the general contractor for the secure areas project and the general contractor for the unsecure portion of the facility, or any requirements to ensure consistency and interoperability in the building technology or equipment across both projects (e.g. building automation systems, fire alarms, physical access control, etc)</p>
<p>&bull; Answer 2: Coordination will be required between the non-secure General Contractor and secure General Contractor to ensure consistency and interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Question 3: It is our understanding that the security facilities are already in place Phase III, can we assume they will also be in place for KORCOM or will we need to install?</p>
<p>&bull; Answer 3: The temporary site security will already be in place for both Phase III Facility and USFK Operations Center (KORCOM).</p>
<p>(End of Q&amp;A, 31 May 16)</p>
