The Economic and Manpower Analysis Division (EMAD) of the Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) Directo rate, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), is responsible for publishing the Projected Defense Purchases by Industry and State.  This publication is provided to members of Congress with direct oversight of defense and is also available to the public.  The publication fulfills both a legislative requirement and an industrial desire for data on planned purchases that can help make better informed investment decisions.  The primary task is to take the defense demands allocated industry and location; incor porate these in a macroeconomic input-output model that allocates direct expenditures, indirect expenditures, and employment by state, industry, and occupation.  Interindustry Forecasting at the University of Maryland (INFORUM or IERF, Inc.) developed the Defense Employment and Purchasing Projection System (DEPPS).  DEPPS uses an economic input-output model to estimate demands for subassemblies, parts, materials, and services that the Department of Defense (DoD) generates through its purchases.  This report  is distributed to Congress in the fall of each year.  INFORUM or IERF, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique or highly specialized.  INFORUM or IERF, Inc . holds ownership of the proprietary input-output forecasting models that feed into the DEPPS process to produce the final report.  The models are Long-Term Industry Forecasting Tool (LIFT) and Interindustry Large-scale Integrated and Dynamic (Iliad).  INF ORUM or IERF, Inc. has developed, maintained and operated the DEPPS.

<SUBJECT>L -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH, Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) Security Non-Guard Services
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY TO VALIDATE SCOPE AND GROUPING for CNIC Security Non-Guard Services.  Conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil),  is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing security non-guard services activities throughout the Continental United States, Hawaii, and Guam.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the security non-guard services activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Commercial & Other Than Commercial Vehicle Inspections (entry control point, non-interdiction), Mobile Vehicle Inspections (non-interdiction), Drug and Explosive Detection Dogs (non-interdiction), Pass and Identification, Dispatch and Intrusion Detection System/Closed Circuit Television Monitoring (including Security, Fire, Emergency Medical, and Emergency Management), Court Administration Services, Armory and Ready for Issue, Security Training, Physical Security, Supply/Logistics, General Administration, Crime Prevention Program, Surveillance Detection (in a surge, non-interdiction capacity), Harbor Patrol Barrier Maintenance, Abandoned Vehicle Impound, and Traffic Control.  Excluded from the scope are inherently governmental law enforcement activities, security guard functions which may not be contracted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2465, and final signature/approval of developed policies, procedures, plans, budgets, etc. which are inherently governmental.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Billet Titles and Count by Installation.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.  General information regarding the Regions and Installations set forth in Attachment 1 is available via the CNIC website at http://www.cnic.navy.mil/Regions.htm.
The initial work breakdown structure (WBS) grouping of activities (which is set forth in Attachment 2A discussed below) is primarily based on the Navy’s Facility Support Contract/Base Operations Support (FSC/BOS) Template which provides a common framework for Navy-wide performance-based contracts and which aligns with the Navy’s Installation Management Accounting Project (IMAP) Core Business Model (CBM) and Cost Accounting Codes (CAC).  Additional information regarding the nature of the initial scope and grouping activities may be obtained by referring to the following publicly available directives and instructions:  OPNAV Instructions 3440.17, 5530.14C, 11200.5C, 5585.2B, 5580-1A, 3591.1D, 5560.10B, 5530.13C ; SECNAVINST 5822.1B and 5530.4C; and DOD Directive 5525.4.

Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Market Research Questionnaire and associated Attachment 2A, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Scope and Grouping and Attachment 2B, CNIC Security Non-Guard Past Performance History no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 21 Jul 06.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Laurie Cordell, at laurie.cordell@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Cordell at 843-820-5621.  YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS MARKET RESEARCH ENDEAVOR IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ASSISTING CNIC IN MAKING THE BEST COMPETITIVE SOURCING DECISION.

Participation is voluntary; respondents will not be paid to participate.

Small business sources will be considered in this research.

NOTE: This is to advise any commercial source providing information as part of this market reseach process that your information will NOT be used later as part of the evaluation process should you choose to submit a proposal in response to any solicitation that may result in the future.

A contract will NOT result from this market research. One or more separate solicitations for the services described herein MAY be issued in the future.

<SUBJECT>D -- On-Line Legal Library/Research Database
<DESC>FISC Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia Division intends to acquire on a sole source basis with Thompson/West and Lexis Nexis for unlimited on-line subscription to legal, legislative, news, public records, financial & medical research databases with on-site training services for 2400 users worldwide for the Office of the Judge Advocate General (OJAG), Washington DC.  The Government anticipates award of two separate firm fixed price contracts, one to West Law the other to Lexis Nexis for the above-described services, services described in the Statement of Work (SOW), and the following unique features:
 - LexisNexis has the following unique elements:  Copyrighted admiralty information which provides: domestic federal and state maritime case law from 1923; Canadian statutes and cases, as well as other historical documents from various federal departments, such as the Federal Maritime Commission and the National Transportation Safety Board, treaties and manuals for U.S. Marshals; full text of arbitration awards decisions; explanations of court opinions and their implications; reprints of hard-to-find primary source material, charter parties and clauses
treaties, admiralty rules, marine insurance forms, practice and procedure forms on a variety of maritime issues; Copyrighted legislative histories prepared by Congressional Information Service (CIS) which  include key U.S. Public Laws from first consideration through presidential signature.  Abstracts of the hearings, reports, prints and documents cited in the Legislative Histories are included in the compilation.  The following productivity enhancing search options for both online news sources as well as online legal sources:  “plain English" (i.e., a phrase or question) searching; search tool which allows users to highlight key passages in documents and automatically launch searches to find new materials containing similar language; when you find an on-point document, capability to finds additional documents like the first with no need to choose more search words; special commands, such as CAPS, NOCAPS, ALLCAPS help you pinpoint acronyms and special spelling; core terms that are derived directly from the case itself and not from a legal editor so the case speaks for itself; can retrieve the full text of legislation referenced in a news or legal publication article.
 - Thompson/West has the following unique elements: Copyrighted editorial enhancements which enhance attorney productivity and reduce training requirements: Headnotes, synopses, and parallel citations; Key Number System which is considered the standard key number system for legal issues.
The base period of performance is 30 September 2006 – 29 September 2007 for Lexis/Nexis and 1 October 2006 through 30 September 2007 for Thompson/West with up to four one-year optional periods.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals however, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  Numbered Note 22 Applies.

<SUBJECT>--Defense Employment and Purchasing Projection System (DEPPS).
<DESC>Reference FedBizOpps Numbered Note #26.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Interindustry Economic Research Funds, Inc. (IERF, Inc. or Informum).  IERF, Inc. or Inforum is the only responsible source capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services required are unique or highly specialized.  In 1995, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Program Analysis and Evaluation), together with Interindustry Forecasting at the Univer sity of Maryland (IERF, Inc. or INFORUM) developed the Defense Employment and Purchasing Projection System (DEPPS).  IERF, Inc. or INFORUM has developed, maintained and operated the DEPPS.  DEPPS uses an economic input-output model to estimate demands for subassemblies, parts, materials, and services that the DoD generates through its purchases.  The DEPPS output and publication of the 2006 DEPPS is due to Congress by September 2006.
