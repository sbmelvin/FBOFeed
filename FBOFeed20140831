<DESC>Under the Authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), through the U.S.&nbsp;Census Buerau, intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis:<br />Vendor: McDash Analytics, LLC.<br /><br />Description of Requirement:&nbsp;Vendor to provide monthly data on mortgages in order to calculate the effect of mortgage interest paid to improve the rental income estimates, an important component of gross domestic income.&nbsp; <br /><br />The data must be provided in a consistent time series. The data must also be representative of the residential mortgages outstanding in the United States and contain significantly detailed mortgage characteristics.
<p>In&nbsp;addition to having the totals, the data will be classified by interest type, lien position, grade, and product type (list below).</p>
<p>The monthly reports will include the following data for residential mortgages: interest paid, interest accrued, unpaid principle balance, unpaid principle balance for new originations, principal paid via regular amortization, and principal paid via prepayment.<br />The measures provided in these reports will be both units (number of mortgages) and dollars.<br />The reports will be delivered in the form of Microsoft Excel files.<br />The mortgage data reported will be based on the reporting of mortgage servicers.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />&bull; Base Year: Monthly data for September 30, 2014 - September 29, 2015<br />&bull; Option Year 1: Monthly data for September 30, 2015 - September 29, 2016<br />&bull; Option Year 2: Monthly data for September 30, 2016 - September 29, 2017<br />&bull; Option Year 3: Monthly data for September 30, 2017 - September 29, 2018<br />&bull; Option Year 4: Monthly data for September 30, 2018 - September 29, 2019</p>
<p>Data Deliverables:<br />Measures:<br />1. Total count<br />2. Total unpaid principle balance<br />3. This month's new originations count<br />4. This month's new originations unpaid principle balance<br />5. This month's total interest paid<br />6. This month's accrued interest<br />7. This month's principal paid (regular amortization)<br />8. This month's principal paid (pre-payments)</p>
<p>Cuts:<br />1. Interest Type<br />a. Fixed<br />b. ARM<br />c. Other<br />2. Lien Position<br />a. Primary (1st lien)<br />b. Subsequent (2nd or greater lien)<br />3. Grade<br />a. Agency Prime<br />b. Non-Agency Prime<br />c. Subprime<br />d. Alt-A<br />e. Government<br />f. Other<br />4. Product Type<br />a. FHA<br />b. VA<br />c. Conventional<br />d. Other</p>
<p>BEA needs a consistent time series of the effective rate of mortgage interest and total mortgage interest paid. BEA needs the data to calculate rental income and interest estimates, important factors in GDI. The data must come from a large, consistent, representative sample of mortgages across the United States. BEA also needs to receive these monthly mortgage data within 2-3 weeks of the end of the calendar month in order for the data to be incorporated in to BEA's monthly estimates.&nbsp; To meet this rapid schedule, the data must also come from mortgage servicing data because no other source can provide this information so quickly.<br /><br />By purchasing mortgage data for mortgage interest paid, interest accrues, and unpaid principal balance, BEA can produce more accurate, up-to-date estimates of changes in the effective rate of mortgage interest and mortgage interest paid that reflect the mortgage market and constantly changing mortgage products.<br /><br />BEA believes that McDash Analytics&nbsp;is the only vendor that can satisfy this requirement as sited above.&nbsp;&nbsp;This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;A purchase order for the services will be awarded using Simplified Acqusition Procedures.</p>
