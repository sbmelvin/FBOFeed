<CONTACT>Dr. Dana A. Brewer, LWS SET Program Executive, Phone (202) 358-1678, Fax (202) 358-3333, Email dbrewer@hq.nasa.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) solicits  information from U.S. industry, universities, nonprofit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, U.S. Government agencies, and non-U.S. organizations about their interest in partnering as a project or program partner in the Living With a Star (LWS) Space Environment Testbeds (SET) Program.  (Definitions of project and program partners appear below.) The LWS SET Program seeks to develop products that will minimize the requirements for margins in spacecraft design and operations to account for the uncertainties in the space environment in the presence of a spacecraft (i.e., the induced environment) and its effects.  Only induced space environments and their effects that change with solar activity are included in the LWS SET Program.  Minimizing the requirements for margins in spacecraft design and operations may increase the payload fraction in a spacecraft, permit the use of a smaller launch vehicle (thereby reducing mission cost), and/or enable routine operations in new segments of the environment (such as at the altitudes between 2000 km to 10,000 km above the Earth's surface) at costs similar to those for operations below 2000 km.  Several SET projects, one starting about every two years, will seek to minimize the requirements for margins.= =20 Each project contains several investigations, and each investigation includes collecting data in space and using it to develop investigation products.  The LWS SET Program divides requirements for products into five categories of induced space environments and effects as follows:  (1) Characterization of the space environment in the presence of a spacecraft; (2) Definition of the mechanisms for materials' degradation and the performance characterization of materials designed for shielding from ionizing radiation; (3) Accommodation and/or mitigation of space environment effects for detectors/sensors; (4) Performance improvement methodology for microelectronics used in space; and (5) Accommodation and/or mitigation of charging/discharging effects on spacecraft and spacecraft components. Each LWS SET investigation is required to partner in (or provide a contribution to the success of) an LWS SET project or program.  The three types of partnerships are experiment, project, and program partners and are described as follows: =B7      Experiment partners are organizations that intend to contribute resources for their experiment(s) in ways that affect only their experiment(s) on the SET-1 Project.  Successful U.S. experiment partners may obtain funding from NASA.  They should propose to the NASA Research Announcement NRA 02-OSS-04 (in the companion FBO). =B7  Project partners are organizations that intend to contribute resources  to the SET-1 Project (and do not have plans contribute to a follow-on SET project) in ways that affect more than their experiment(s).	NASA will provide no funding for project partners.=20 Potential project partners should respond to this RFI and not to the NASA Research Announcement NRA 02-OSS-04 (in the companion FBO). =B7	   Program partners are organizations that intend to contribute resources to more than one SET project in ways that affect more than their experiment(s) in each project.  NASA will provide no funding for program partners.  Potential program partners should respond to this RFI and not to the NASA Research Announcement NRA 02-OSS-04 (in the companion FBO). To facilitate the shared development, NASA requests that organizations interested in participating in the LWS SET Program as a SET-1 Project or LWS SET Program partner respond to Dr. Dana A. Brewer, Sun-Earth Connection Division, Code SS, Office of Space Science, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC  20546-0001; TEL: (202) 358-1678; E-mail: dbrewer@hq.nasa.gov to express that interest by December 18, 2002.  NASA is not soliciting proposals through this RFI at this time.  NASA expects that responses to this RFI will initiate discussions about the mutual benefit of partnering and, if NASA and the responder agree that a partnership is in the best interest of both parties, the partnership will be documented in an agreement.  If a mutually beneficial partnership cannot be reached, no further action will be taken as a result of a response to this RFI.	Responses should not include proprietary information. NASA and its project and program partners will share in developing the requirements for SET-1 Project and/or the LWS SET Program as applicable.=09=20

<DESC>NASA plans to renew its agreement with IMAX Space, Ltd. ("IMAX"), to enable collaborative production of an additional large format 3D film on the International Space Station (ISS). This collaboration builds upon the recent release of the IMAX 3D film SPACE STATION, produced in cooperation with NASA, which is now one of the top-20 grossing films in the United States. The new film will document completion of Station assembly as the Japanese and European laboratories are attached and the tempo of activities on ISS accelerates.  In the new film collaboration, NASA and IMAX seek to create a sequel of similar technical quality, educational content, and popular appeal. NASA has selected IMAX for this additional ISS film opportunity because IMAX has developed the only space-certified large format 3D camera system available to ensure seamless documentation of the completion of ISS assembly.   In initiating this collaboration, NASA does not seek to preclude, and indeed welcomes, proposals for additional large format film collaborations involving other NASA activities. Moreover, at an appropriate time, NASA intends to announce future opportunities for large format film collaborations on the fully assembled ISS.	This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 09/16/2002.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The MEP's will be used to provide power to support a Mobile Facility (MF) complex, a complex of habitable shelters in an austere expeditionary environment.  The load bank will be used to support the MEP operationally, and for maintenance of the MEP.  In operation the load bank will be used to provide and maintain a minimal level of loading on the MEP to alleviate the wet stacking commonly experienced on under loaded diesel engines.  In the maintenance role, the load bank will be used to perform load testing and periodic operational checks of MEP's. The load bank requirements are 200 kW at 120/208 or 240/416 VAC, 3 phase, 4-wire, and grounding at 50 or 60hz.

A long-term warrantee is desirable.  We intend to procure two (2) First Article Test (FAT) units for functional testing by the government.  Delivery is required within 60 Days After Contract (DAC). The evaluation will last for a period of 90 days. Upon successful completion of functional testing we intend to exercise an option for thirty (30) production units at a rate of three units (3) per month to commence one-hundred-twenty (120) days after exercise of option.  Another option to procure an additional forty (40) units will be available.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government technical, past performance, and price considered.   The solicitation, with details of the technical proposals required to be submitted, will appear on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select "Business". Then "Doing Business with us" and "Open Solicitation." No solicitations will be mailed and no hard copies of solicitations will be made available.

The estimated release of the RFP is 10 Sep 2002, with a closing date of 10 Oct 2002. Phone, fax or e-mail requests for RFPs will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Incyte Genomics, In., 3160 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, to acquire one set of Mouse Unigene I Easy to Spot PCR Products.  Incyte Genomics, Inc., is the only provider of this unique set.  The Center for Cancer Research maintains a state-of-the-art facility for the production of gene microarrays.  The microarrays allow researcher to study simultaneously by differential expression of large numbers of cancer genes in normal and diseased or treated cells.  The CCR Microarray Facility uses modern lab automation and robotic methods to "print" these arrays by spotting small volumes of prepared cDNA clones (PCR products) at specific location on specially prepared glass slides.  (PCR products of cDNA clones from multiple thousands of genes can localized to small glass slide.  The composition of the PCR sets and quality controls used in their manufacture are critically important for the continuation of existing experimental protocols and standards.  The NCI/CCR Microarray facility has ongoing projects utilizing Incyte products previously (263-MQ-211701), having produced thousands of microarrays which are in use by intramural invesitgators and the NIH MouseModels of Human Disease Consortium.  An important aspect is the clones are not full-length copies of the genes of interest, but are biased towards the 3' end of the gene.  In practical terms, this means that clone form the same genes, but generated from other vendors, will have a different composition.  It is critical for experimental continuity and reproducibility that the NCI/CCR continue to acquire from this source.  Incyte Genomics Inc., is the only source known to the government that can meet the required specifications.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Capability statements and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient matieral to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.

<DESC>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Chernobyl Research Unit (CUR) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), NCI, intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Dr. Mikhail Savkin, Zeleonaya St 12, #100 141400 Khimki, Moscow Region, Russia.  The Contract shall be to provide data, data analysis, and an estimation of radionuclide concentrations in samples of milk, milk produts, and leafy vegetables collected in Belarus within two months following the Chernobly accident.  The REB currently sponsors international projects on "Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases in Belarus (BY) and Ukraine (UA) following the Chernobyl Accident".  Thyroid cancer among individuals who were small children at the time of the Chernobyl accident (26 April 1986) seems to be the most important health effect resulting from the accident.  A very important party of the project is the estimation of the thyroid doses for all cohort subjects, as well as an assessment of the uncertainties attached to the thyroid dose estimates.  Thyroid doses need to be reconstructed for tens of thousands of subjects from BY and UA.  The main pathyways of exposure were the consumption of contaminated milk and milk products as well as, to a smaller extent, consumption of leafy vegetables and inhalation of contaminated air.  The thyroid doses were mainly due to Iodine-131 (I-131), a short-lived radionuclide with a radioactive half-life of eight (8) days.  Of particular importance in the environmental transfer approach is the acquisition ad processing of measurements of radioactivity in milk.  It is reported that about 100,000 measurements of total beta activity in milk, milk products, and leafy vegetables were made in May-June 1986 in Belarus. An expert is needed: (1) to locate and obtain these data; (2) to assess their usefulness; and (3) to process in order to derive the I-131 concentrations, and other radionuclides in samples of milk, milk products, and leafy vegetables.  The contractor shall collect the results of at least 10,000 total beta-activity measurements in milk, milk products and leafy vegetables conducted in Belarus in April- June 1986; analyze the consistency of the colleced results; obtain at least 5 of the currently available devices that made were used in 1986 for measurement and test the devices to determine the geometry of measurements and the calibration coefficients; compare the estimates of radionuclide activities reconstrued from the total beta-activity measurements with the results obtained from gamma-spectrometric measurements; analyze the consistency of the reconstructed assessments; and provide a detailed assessment of the uncertainties attached to the estimates.  The contractor shall, every three months, provide progress reports and a final on the analysis.  Dr. Savkin is uniquely qualified to carry out this study because of: (1) his expertise in the techniques of radiation measurements; (2)his personal relationships with the experts who were responsible for the measurements, and (3) his experience in management.  Dr. Savkin has knowledge of the manner in which the samples of milk, milk products, and leafy vegetables taken in Belarus within  two months after the Chernobyl accident were measured, analyzed, and stored.  He has access to a laboratory in which measurements of radionuclides in environmental materials are routinely conducted.  Dr. Savkin has worked for more than 20 years at the Institute of Biophysics (IBP) of the Russian Ministry of Public Health and is currently Deputy Director of that Institute.  The Institute was responsible for the health and safety of the workers and of the public related to the operation of all nuclear facilities, including the Chorobyl nuclear power plant.  Following the reactor accident in 1986, the Institute organized the campaigns of measurements of radioactivity in Belarus and collected a large part of the results for analysis.  Dr. Savkin was an integral part of this effort and has direct access to many of the measurements that were in Belarus.  The Contract period is for one year with one 12-month option period.  FAR clauses 52.217-9 Options to Extend the Term of the Contract and 52.217-8 Option to Extend Servcies, are included by reference.  Dr. Mikhail Savkin is the only known source to the Government that can provide the above requirements specified.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than September 11, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1)and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13. If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), intends to procure on a sole source basis with Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, Texas 78228, services for the Analysis of Iowa corn and soybean herbicides in residential dust.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  NCI conducted a large multi-center case-control study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in Iowa, Detroit, Seattle and Los Angeles.  Data collection was completed in March of 2001.  The study protocol included the collection of dust samples from participants' vacuum cleaners in order to measure residential exposure to pesticides and other chemicals. This analysis is required in support of an ongoing study to determine if crops grown around a residence are a source of pesticide exposures in the home. There has been an increased use of two new chemical classes of herbicides, the sulfonylureas and the imidazolinones.  These types of herbicides require different chemical extraction methods and analysis methods from the pesticides currently being analyzed under the existing contract.  Additionally, the two major herbicides used on soybeans, pendimethalin and trifluralin, also require different analysis methods that were not funded in the original contract.  SWRI has the requisite experience and expertise to conduct analysis of pesticides in house dust.  In order to accomplish this aim, it will be necessary to measure all the major agricultural pesticides in the vacuum bag dust and compare the pesticide levels in dust to the area of crops around the homes and the distance and direction of the homes from crop fields.  The purpose of this contract is to analyze levels of specific sulfonlyurea and imidazolinone herbicides in dust samples and to analyze levels of pendimethalin and trifluralin in dust samples.  Contractor services that are required:  1) Analysis in a maximum of 42 dust samples (including quality control samples) from Iowa of levels of dimethenamid, trifluralin, and pendimethalin using the method developed by SWRI; 2) Analysis of bromoxynil and bentazone using an acid extraction method in a maximum of 42 samples (including quality control samples).  This analysis will also include re-analysis of 5 other acidic target analytes (2,4-D, dicamba, pentachlorophenol, MCPA and 2,4,5-T).  The re-analysis will also allow NCI to compare our detection rates and we will be able to evaluate possible degradation over time as a result of dust storage.  This analysis will also include the re-analysis of acetochlor, alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, metolachlor, and terbufos.  Period of performance: upon award of purchase order through 6 months with one (1) six (6) month option period if exercised.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Service (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington D.C. time) on September 3, 2002.   If you have and questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational Epidemiology Branch (OEB) plans to procure services with Henry Ford Hospital, Science Center, 2799W Grand Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan 48202 for a Pilot Study of Medication Use and Risk of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma and Barrett's Esophagus.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The Occupational Epidemiology Branch plans to examine the association between medications that relax the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus. The analyses must address the following public health questions: 1) the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus related to the use of specific medications, 2) the risk associated with the use of combinations of such medications, 3) the dose-response relations in terms of both duration of use and prescribed dose, and 4) the associations between esophageal adenocarcinoma and certain medical conditions potentially on the causal pathway, such as Barrett's esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Two previous studies have examined the relationship between medication use and esophageal adenocarcinoma have relied on self-reported medication use information, which is subject to both differential and nondifferential misclassification. To overcome the limitations associated with self-reported data, these new analyses must use accurate, objective, and detailed medication use data (including prescribed dose, frequency of prescription refills, and duration of use) in conjunction with detailed information on the cancer and other medical conditions of interest. Minimum Requirements: 1) Contractor shall have access to a large study population of at least 250,000 men and women with prepaid health care, with detailed prospective data on prescription medication use, selected medical conditions, and cancer outcomes. This data must be available for epidemiologic analysis; 2) have sufficient power to assess the relationship between individual medication use and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma; 3) the study needs to have detailed long-term computerized data on medication use, and that data must be linked to patients diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma and other medical conditions being examined; 4) the study population shall include at least 12% of African Americans.  Period of Performance: upon award of purchase order through 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  Henry Ford Hospital is the only known source to the NCI that can provide the aforementioned minimum requirements. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of  Medicine (NLM) to procure professional evaluation services on a sole source basis from MBS Consulting, Jersey City, NJ to conduct online focus groups to evaluate new web products designed by NLM's Specialized Information Services (SIS) division.  The contractor will conduct five online focus groups evaluating three web-based resources being developed by the SIS division of  NLM. Results will be used to guide feasibility and design decisions.  The contractor will submit transcripts of the focus groups and a written report and analysis to NLM.  The contractor will also recruit, screen, and provide incentives to participants according to selection and sampling criteria established with NLM.  Participants may include toxicologists, industrial health practitioners, students, science teachers and the general public.  The contractor will also work with participants to resolve technical problems that may arise in accessing both the NLM products to be reviewed and the web software needed to participate in an online forum.  The contractor will provide NLM with transcripts and a written report and analysis within a 30-day period following each focus group.  Commencing with contract approval, focus groups will be scheduled and conducted as products become ready for evaluation.  Each focus group will be conducted within 6 weeks of SIS's notification to the contractor that a product is ready.  MBS Consulting specializes in conducting nationwide in-depth online focus groups focusing specifically on online health information users.  MBS Consulting also has the capability to recruit focus group participants from health professionals, scientists, researchers and others that are harder to reach for this kind of evaluation, as well as from the general public.  MBS Consulting also offers the possibility of follow-on custom online user surveys and competitive web site analysis with benchmarking to its nationwide in-depth consumer surveys.  MBS Consulting is the only vendor  that has both considerable experience with online focus groups (including a nationwide pool of prospective participants to draw from) and knowledge of  NLM's products, services and evaluation needs.  MBS Consulting also has access to a database of current users of SIS products who have indicated an interest in participating in evaluation activities.  Any other source would not be able to meet NLM's needs.  MBS Consulting successfully completed a very similar contract conducting several online focus groups evaluating NLM's MEDLINEplus web site and NIHSeniorHealth web site in 2001-2.  The cost for this contract is reduced because the questions and methodology used for the SIS focus groups will be very similar to those already developed and used for the previous NLM focus group evaluations.  The period of performance is anticipated for a period of twelve (12) months.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information and staffing criteria.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Living With a Star (LWS) Space Environment Testbed (SET) Program intends to solicit investigations from U.S. industry, universities, nonprofit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, U.S. Government agencies, and non-U.S. organizations for its first project, SET-1.	The investigations will develop products that will reduce the requirements for margins in spacecraft design and operations to account for the uncertainties in the space environment in the presence of a spacecraft (i.e., the induced environment) and its effects.  Only induced space environments and their effects that change with solar activity are included in the LWS SET Program.  Minimizing the requirements for margins in spacecraft design and operations may increase the payload fraction in a spacecraft, permit the use of a smaller launch vehicle (thereby reducing mission cost), and/or enable routine operations in new segments of the environment (such as at the altitudes between 2000 km to 10,000 km above the Earth's surface) at costs similar to those for operations below 2000 km.  Several SET projects, one starting about every two years, will seek to reduce the requirements for margins.  Each project contains several investigations, and each investigation includes collecting data in space and using it to develop investigation products.  Each proposal must contribute resources to its investigation that will complement NASA's contribution.  If the contribution affects only the single investigation contained in the proposal or if the proposer requests NASA funds for the investigation, the proposer is designated as an experiment partner and a proposal to the subject NRA is appropriate.  However, if the resource contribution will affect more than a single investigation in the SET-1 Project and if no NASA funds are requested, the proposer should respond to the accompanying Request for Information (RFI) instead of responding to the subject NRA.  No exchange of funds will occur with non-U.S. experiment partners. The subject NRA will solicit proposals in response to requirements for products from investigations in five categories of space environments and effects as follows:  (1) Characterization of the space environment in the presence of a spacecraft;  (2) Definition of the mechanisms for materials' degradation and the performance characterization of materials designed for shielding from ionizing radiation; (3) Accommodation and/or mitigation of space environment effects for detectors/sensors; (4) Performance improvement methodology for microelectronics used in space; and, (5) Accommodation and/or mitigation of charging/discharging effects on spacecraft and spacecraft components.  NASA will issue contracts for awards to non-Government U.S. organizations and appropriate agreements for other organizations.  Successful proposers will participate in a Study Phase and deliver a Study Report at the end of the Study Phase.  The Study Reports will be used in a peer review process to reduce the number (i.e., down-select) of investigations that will continue with formulation and implementation. The NRA will be accessible on the Internet through the menu listings, "Research Solicitations" and then "Current (Open) Solicitations" starting from the Office of Space Science home page at  http://spacescience.nasa.gov/  on or about September 17, 2002.  Obtain additional programmatic information from Dr. Dana A. Brewer, LWS SET Program Executive, Sun-Earth Connection Division, Code SS, Office of Space Science, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001; TEL: (202) 358-1678; E-mail: dbrewer@hq.nasa.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with the Institute for Regulatory Sciences (RSI) to provide a Peer Review of Radionuclide Transport in the Environment: Research Program Plan March 2002.  The NRC has written a program plan for its research on radionuclide transport in the environment.  The emphasis of the plan is on subsurface radionuclide transport issues that have to be considered in the NRC's regulation of decommissioning facilities, uranium recovery facilities, and low and high level radioactive waste disposal.  The plan was reviewed by many NRC staff, consultants, and experts.  Several commenters recommended that the plan receive a formal peer review.  RSI has 16 years of experience organizing and coordinating anonymous peer reviews using qualified individuals to provide unbiased review of Federal environmental, engineering, and research programs.  This is a unique characteristic of RSI.  The period of performance of this effort is 4 months.  The proposed contract action is for technical assistance for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all capability statements received by September 6, 2002,  will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ)5-83055-946 for one each/WA-1500 IR wavemeter with wavelength range 1.5 to 4 microns, absolute accuracy +/- 0.2 parts per million and one each/GPIB interface option. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Burleigh Instruments at 7647 Main Street Fishers, Victor, New York 14565 only.  A wavelength meter is needed in the Laser/Electro-Optics Branch that meets the following minimum requirements: Wavelength range to include 1.5 to 4 microns.  Vacuum wavelength absolute accuracy +/-0.2 parts per million or smaller; minimum input power 1MW or less; maximum input power 100 MN or greater; Automatic compensation for temperature and atmospheric pressure.= =20 Selectable fiber (FC) and free-space inputs.  Visible tracer beam for free-space input.Free-space input aperture diameter 2 millimeters or larger.  Measurement rate 1 measurement per second or faster.  GPIB interface. A survey was made of companies that sell photonic instrumentation.  The ability to meet two of the listed requirements makes the Burleigh WA-1500 inique: The absolute accuracy and the wavelength range. Other similar instruments on the market claim absolute accuracy of at best 2 parts per million, and wavelength range only into the near infrared (up to about 1.8 microns), therefore, only the WA-1500 from Burleigh Instruments will meet the requirement. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 10, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The COR shall contact the contractor(s) via e-mail, facsimile, and/or telephone with requests for, changes to, or cancellations of interpreter services.  The COR will provide pertinent information related to the assignment (date, time, projected length of assignment, type of assignment, location, consumer?s name, two (2) points of contact (POC) names and their telephone numbers, and language preference.)  Requests shall be made by the COR at a minimum of two (2) business days prior to the assignment between the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  Occasions may occur where the COR is unable to provide the required two (2) business days notice.  When less than two (2) days notice is given, the contractor shall have the right to refuse the assignment.  The contractor(s)? refusal must be given within 2 hours of the time the order was placed during the DLA business day from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  If the contractor(s) accepts the order it shall be billed at the hourly rate established.  No special rates shall be used for orders placed with less than two (2) business day?s notice.  The contractor(s) shall provide the COR the name(s) of the interpreter(s) and the level of the interpreter?s certification at a minimum twenty-four (24) hours prior to the assignment.  C.4 QUALIFICATIONS OF INTERPRETERS  All interpreters should have a National Association of the Deaf (NAD) Level III (Generalist), Level IV (Advanced), or Level V Master) certification and/or a Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Comprehensive Skills Certification (CSC).  If interpreters with these certifications are not provided by the contractor, the interpreters provided must be approved by a cross section of DLA?s employees with hearing impairments. All interpreters shall conduct themselves according to the NAD and/or RID code of ethics.  C.5 NUMBER OF INTERPRETERS REQUIRED  The number of interpreters is subject to the approval of the COR.  In general, two (2) interpreters shall be required for assignments lasting more than two (2) hours, detailed technical assignments, or platform assignment lasting more than one (1) hour.  C.6 ARRIVAL OF INTERPRETERS  Full time and part-time interpreters  Arrival will be 15 minutes prior to assigned duty hours. To enter the McNamara Complex and its buildings and Headquarters, interpreters, full time and  part-time, must have a photo ID that is accepted by DLA?s Security Office; for example, a valid driver?s license.  Ad hoc interpreter  Interpreters shall arrive not later than thirty (30) minutes prior to a scheduled assignment no matter where the assignment is located.  To enter the McNamara Complex and its buildings and Headquarters, interpreters, full time and  part-time, must have a photo ID that is accepted by DLA?s Security Office; for example, a valid driver?s license. Sufficient time must be allocated by interpreters for entrance into the McNamara Complex secured parking area and subsequent secured entrance into the McNamara Complex building.  Interpreters shall access the building through the main entrance.  Upon clearing security, interpreters shall call the POC provided to them by the COR to escort them to the assignment if the POC is not at the security desk to do so.  The contractor(s) shall not bill the Government for any of the time described in this paragraph.   C.7 NO DEAF EMPLOYEES ATTEND ASSIGNMENT  Ad hoc interpreters  If an ad hoc interpreter is on-site for a scheduled assignment open to a general audience and no one requiring interpreter services attend, the interpreter shall contact the POC for the assignment or the Interpreter Services COR located in the DO-S office, Room 1119, McNamara Complex, Fort Belvoir, Virginia thirty (30) minutes after the start of the event.  The COR reserves the option, with notification of the change to the contractor, to assign the interpreter to another request of equal duration without an additional charge or cancellation fee for the original request.  Exception:  If the event is being video taped, the full-time, two part-time and all ad hoc interpreters shall provide interpreting services if requested to do so by the POC for the assignment or COR whether there are people in attendance requiring interpreter services or not.  C.8 LIBERAL LEAVE FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES  Full time and part time interpreters report to work as usual.  Ad hoc interpreters  If the Federal Government is on liberal leave, the contractor(s) shall check with the COR or their POC for the assignment for verification that the event will continue as scheduled.  If the event has been canceled, the contractor(s) may assess the cancellation fee for less than 24 continuous hours notice.   C.9 CLOSURE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER OR EMERGENCY  Full-time and part-time interpreters  If the Federal Government is closed due to inclement weather or other emergency situations, full-time and part-time interpreters will not report to work and no cancellation fee shall be assessed.   Ad hoc interpreters  If the Federal Government is closed due to inclement weather or other emergency situations, ad hoc interpreters will not report to work and no cancellation fee shall be assessed.  C.10 HOURLY RATE FOR SERVICES  The hourly rate includes all travel expenses, evening assignments and weekend assignments.  Attachment J.2 provides the job history for 1996 to date.  The contractor shall bill the Government using the flat rate established in the pricing schedule.  C.11 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES  Ad hoc interpreters requests  Regardless of assignment duration, the contractor(s) shall be reimbursed for a minimum of two (2) hours.  Assignments lasting more than two (2) hours shall be invoiced for the actual duration of the assignment and not the estimated duration called in by the COR when issuing the order.  For billing purposes the contractor(s) shall round up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest hour.  The contractor(s) shall bill in whole hour units only.  For example, if the COR places an order for an assignment that is anticipated to last from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. but the assignment actually lasts from 8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., the contractor(s) shall bill the Government for 4 hours of service.  If the assignment lasted from 8:00 a.m. to 11:15 a.m., the contractor(s) shall bill the Government for 3 hours of service.  C.12 CANCELLATION OF ASSIGNMENT  Ad hoc interpreter requests  The COR shall notify the contractor(s) by e-mail, facsimile, or telephone if an assignment is canceled.  Assignments canceled less than or equal to twenty-four (24) continuous hours shall be reimbursed at the number of projected scheduled hours for the assignment multiplied by the applicable hourly rate.  Assignments canceled prior to twenty-four (24) continuous hours before the assignment shall not be reimbursed.  C.13 FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICE  The contractor(s) shall provide interpreting services upon request as long as the time lines described within this Statement of Work (SOW) are adhered to by the COR.  If for any reason not described in this SOW, the contractor(s) fails to fulfill an interpreter service request at the location and time required, the contractor(s) shall not charge the Agency for the requested service; under these conditions the contractor will provide the organization who requested the service one hour of free service the next time interpreting services are requested by that organization.  C.14 EVALUATION OF SERVICES  Recipients of interpreter services shall provide feedback as they desire and/or as requested by the COR on the quality of the interpreter services received.  The COR will provide feedback to the contractor(s) within 24 hours of receipt of the feedback.  The contractor(s) shall take appropriate action based on the feedback and provide the COR with a response to the feedback within 24 hours of receipt of the feedback.

This examination is to be used as a qualifying requirement for candidates to become Enrolled Agents.  By leveraging the experience, expertise and proven methods of the testing industry, the IRS intends to provide a high-quality test and an efficient, secure testing process.  To this end, it seeks the assistance of a qualified professional testing organization (or an alliance of testing organizations) in developing, implementing and administering the new qualifying examination.  A draft statement of objectives (SOO) detailing the requirement is available at www.procurement.irs.treas.gov.  An SOO is used in lieu of a statement of work to provide the maximum flexibility for offerors to propose an innovative approach to the requirement, which satisfies the objective.  In consideration of this SOO, please respond to the following questions:  (1) What types of services are captured in the SOO? (2) How are these services generally priced and/or what pricing structures are appropriate for this requirement and why, e.g. firm fixed, by module, per test?

(5)  What are the metrics or performance standards that are generally applied to this type of project? (6) Are there any industry practices or other suggestions which may be effectively applied to the requirement or a solicitation?  (7) Identify and discuss any issues raised by the SOO.   Please also include a brief description of the services offered by your firm (no brochures please).  The government may contact respondents for clarification of questions.  As prescribed in FAR 52.215-3, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information provided or any costs associated with providing this information.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government?s requirements to industry.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Incyte Genomics, In., 3160 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94304, to acquire one set of Mouse Unigene I Easy to Spot PCR Products.  Incyte Genomics, Inc., is the only provider of this unique set.  The Center for Cancer Research maintains a state-of-the-art facility for the production of gene microarrays.  The microarrays allow researcher to study simultaneously by differential expression of large numbers of cancer genes in normal and diseased or treated cells.  The CCR Microarray Facility uses modern lab automation and robotic methods to "print" these arrays by spotting small volumes of prepared cDNA clones (PCR products) at specific location on specially prepared glass slides.  (PCR products of cDNA clones from multiple thousands of genes can localized to small glass slide.  The composition of the PCR sets and quality controls used in their manufacture are critically important for the continuation of existing experimental protocols and standards.  The NCI/CCR Microarray facility has ongoing projects utilizing Incyte products previously (263-MQ-211701), having produced thousands of microarrays which are in use by intramural invesitgators and the NIH MouseModels of Human Disease Consortium.  An important aspect is the clones are not full-length copies of the genes of interest, but are biased towards the 3' end of the gene.  In practical terms, this means that clone form the same genes, but generated from other vendors, will have a different composition.  It is critical for experimental continuity and reproducibility that the NCI/CCR continue to acquire from this source.  Incyte Genomics Inc., is the only source known to the government that can meet the required specifications.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  Capability statements and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient matieral to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 11, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If you have any questions, pleae contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on respones to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a compeitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accpeted.  NAICS Code: 325413.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is rescinding the earlier request that sought sources to provide Organizational and Intermediate level aircraft maintenance for the T-2 aircraft and associated equipment used in the training of student naval aviators and undergraduate naval flight officers.  Changes in operational requirements have resulted in a planned reduction of CNATRA?s T-2 aircraft.  Commencing in FY03, a draw down program for the existing T-2 aircraft at NAS Meridian, MS will be implemented.  This draw down will be completed in FY04 with the retirement of all T-2 aircraft at NAS Meridian. Naval Air Systems Command plans to negotiate a one-year sole source extension to the current contract, N00019-98-D-0107 with Sikorsky Support Services, Inc. to provide the needed maintenance and draw down support through FY04.   It is presently undetermined how the T-2 and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft at NAS Pensacola, FL and the AIMD support tasks at Corpus Christi, TX will be supported beyond FY04.  Any questions regarding this update should be directed to Matt Reilly, AIR-2.4.3.2.7 at (301) 757-8979 or Craig Simpson, AIR-2.4.3.2 at (301) 757-9062.

Respondents are asked to provide responses which detail proposed methods for satisfying the above referenced requirement as well as preliminary cost/price strategies/projections associated with the services to be provided. Please identify any previous Government contract experiences that are relative to this request.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Sole Source for Dataprocessing Operations and Validation services for the Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) Program Office of the TRICARE Management Activity
<SOLNBR>DASW01-02-R-0010
<RESPDATE>090502
<ARCHDATE>11042002

<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command - Washington (DCC-W), intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with Altarum for the continuation of data processing operations and validation for the Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) Program Office.  The ven dor will perform operational processing of enterprise Military Health System (MHS) data and validation of the processing.  The Enterprise Data architecture developed, operated and maintained by the EI/DS Program Office is widely regarded as the largest and most complex healthcare data warehouse environment in the world.  Specific and unique skill levels and a thorough working knowledge of MHS data and TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) business rules are required to maintain the EI/DS enterprise data architecture.  The distinctive knowledge and experience acquired via this contract involves the processing and validation over one  billion military health records each year. These records are transmitted via dozens of data feeds from over 20 disparate systems and non-system sources for the purpose of centralizing MHS health record data storage.   The MHS health care record formats and the associated record codes are frequently modified and are unique to each military Service.  Every record must be manually processed against complex business rules to normalize the data.  This is unique to the MHS; c ommercial health records have been standardized with the use of the HCFA1500 and UB92 forms. This contract is the sole vehicle by which the maintenance and operation of the processors needed to ingest, handle, and produce data sets for use by reporting sys tems and end users is performed.   Failure to accurately perform the data processing procedures or precisely execute the quality control function at all times would result in at least one of the following: 1.	Rejection of data.  The ability to populate the EI/DS enterprise data architecture (the MHS Data Repository) is dependent upon records being consistent with the Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) process. The MDR feeds all downstream systems a nd sources.   Failure to populate the MDR will result with the inability to populate EI/DS datamarts, and to transmit data to each of the military Services, the Veterans Administration, and other Government organizations. 2.	Disintegration of EI/DS data integrity and data quality.  Improperly applying business rules or failing to discover quality issues following the processing will create inaccurate data records.  Data integrity and data quality are the cornerstones of the  EI/DS Program.  The Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) use EI/DS data to manage the delivery of health care.  The Department of Defense uses EI/DS data to monitor, assess, and manage the business of the MHS (i.e., base closures, resource leveling, etc.).   The GAO uses EI/DS data to assess and report on the MHS in response to congressional guidance.  Inaccurate data can have catastrophic effects when decisions are made based upon erroneous assessments. The Governments requirement is to have one knowledgeable and independent company responsible for the quality assurance and process improvement activities for EI/DS Enterprise Data, as the program is used to feed information into other programs being manag ed by EI/DS Program Office.  Altarum has been selected by the Government to provide the services outlined in the tasks due to the complex nature of the data, Altarums extensive experience and knowledge of MHS data, business rules, and comprehensive unders tanding of the end user requirements.  In many instances, these business rules are not documented and manual intervention and data processing decisions are made based on the knowledge of the end user application of the data.  Altarum has acquired this know ledge over many years of interaction with MHS data. EI/DS has undertaken considerable efforts to automate the data ingest processes required to support the EI/DS architecture. Automation of these pr ocesses is a tedious and lengthy progression.  At this time, very few data feed processes have been automated. EI/DS requires a parallel manual processing be executed as each data feed is automated, to ensure the integrity and quality of the data has not b een impacted.  EI/DS estimates that the data ingest processes will be fully implemented by FY05.  Automation of the ingest function will result in the cessation of this contract requirement. The risks associated with the award of this effort to another ven dor are extremely high.  Inaccurate processing of the MHS data would have impacts measured in millions of dollars. Altarum's QA work has set the standard for the review of processed data and for the future handling of data as MHS processing and repository systems evolve.  QA and improvement activities are integrated as a part of and not overlaid upon tasks performed by  Altarum.  Strictly enforced and monitored, these processes have resulted in the error-free production of data sets, reports, analysis and other services and products on a repeatable and consistent basis.  The continuance of Altarum in this role is fundame ntal to the successful, cost effective, and timely execution of the EI/DS Program Office operational and quality assurance missions.  The amount of time to train a new vendor would impact the Military Health System (MHS) data collection schedule and proces sing quality. As the sole provider of functional verification and validation services to EI/DS, Altarum's products have served to confirm, clarify, or point out inconsistencies with processes, procedures, and policies that impact the operation of data processing and use  of the MHS data.  Verification and validation activities are an integral part of each task undertaken and have specifically resulted in cost and time savings in the area of data processing cycles.  The continuance of Altarum in this role is vital to the s uccessful, cost effective, and timely execution of the EI/DS Program operational, analysis, and quality assurance missions.  Each time EI/DS has experienced a shift in vendors and organizations responsible for the maintenance of data type processors, the Government has suffered unacceptable loss of data, lag time in data set production, errors in processing, lack of quality cont rol, and significant user dissatisfaction and resultant distrust of the content of the reporting system(s) that use the processed data sets. Therefore, Altarum is the only responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)/FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Contract award will consist of one 6-month base period and three 6-month option periods.  The Government anticipates this requirement to conclude at the end of the contract option periods.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541511.  A Justification fo r Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  Fifteen (15) days from the date of the issuance of this notice, the Contracting Officer will proceed in accordance with FAR regulations to award a contract to Altarum for EI/DS Operational Data Processing  & Validation.  This announcement is for informational purpose only.  No solicitation is available.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATIONS ? ORPHAN WASTE.  Kaiser-Hill Company, LLC (Contractor), is the Integrating Management Contractor at DOE's Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) near Denver, Colorado. Kaiser-Hill Company is requesting Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) from prospective Subcontractors who are interested in treating and disposing of Orphan Waste identified herein.  The Offeror's SOQ shall discuss the regulatory and technical requirements identified herein.  As regards to regulatory requirements, Offeror's SOQ shall 1)discuss its permits and licenses with respect to treating the identified waste; 2)demonstrate that its permits and licenses allow each aspect of treatment of these wastes at an approved offsite DOE facility; 3)alternatively, if necessary, Offeror's plans for obtaining revisions to its permits shall be provided; 4)Offeror's shall provide a copy of its most recent Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) and any standard profiling forms used. As regards technical requirements, Offeror's SOQ shall 1)provide a description of the pre-treatment and treatment steps proposed to successfully meet the LDR requirements and waste acceptance criteria; 2)identify the types and capacities of all equipment to be used for handling, pre-treatment, and treatment of the waste; 3)identify the batch volume, process control points and frequency of measurements, as well as sampling points and expectations for the process demonstration; 4)describe how the Offeror will develop and implement procedures and administrative and engineering controls to minimize and/or eliminate contamination as a result of handling and treating the waste; and 5)Offeror's SOQ shall demonstrate that it has the capability to meet all RFETS requirements and deliverables to demonstrate treatment and disposal of the waste.  In addition to regulatory and technical requirements, Offeror's shall provide a summary of previous experience on removal, treatment, and disposal of similar wastes.  Offeror's shall demonstrate in its SOQ that its treatment and methodology will result in a treated waste form that meets radiological, RCRA, and other WAC associated with the respective offsite waste facility.   The following comprise the orphan waste streams at RFETS that will require treatment and disposal:  
Trench 1 DU Fines: approximately 220 cubic meters of depleted uranium (DU) chips and DU-contaminated soil retrieved from Trench 1.  This waste stream was primarily generated from machining and tooling residues and the chips are pyrophoric.  Characterization data collected during the Trench excavation indicated detectable concentrations of VOCs, PCBs, cyanides and cadmium. 
Solified TRU Organic Solids: There are approximately 550 drums of solidified Transuranic organic waste with the potential to generate excessive quantities of hydrogen and volatile organic gases when subjected to WIPP-required elevated temperature gas-generation testing. These waste drums were produced primarily from the treatment of TRU oil and organic liquid wastes through the old Oil and Solvent Immobilization System (OASIS).  The TRU contaminated oils and solvents were mixed with Envirostone emulsifier, gypsum and water, which would produce an immobilized, solid waste form.  Small-scale testing of these type-IV wastes at Argonne West indicated that the waste would exceed the permissible WIPP Waste Acceptance and transportation (TRUPAC-II transporter) limits when tested at the required temperature.  This has been substantiated at INEEL and RFETS with full-scale testing of actual waste drums.
Solidified By-Pass Sludge: approximately 450 cubic meters of drummed solidified bypass sludge with a transuranic activity primarily between 10 nCi/g and 100 nCi/g.  The Building 374 (process waste water treatment building) solidification process was designed to absorb water from the B374 wet slurry.  Portland cement was ?layered? in drums with the wet slurry; the resulting matrix is a non-LDR compliant dried sludge with varying moisture content.  
LDR non-compliant waste and heterogeneous LLMW >10 nCi/g - up to 5,000 cubic meters of legacy and newly generated LLMW D&D debris with a transuranic activity greater than 10 nCi/g.  Debris requires macroencapsulation (40 CFR 268.45); RFETS is interested in evaluating alternative macroencapsulation technologies.
This advertisement is NOT A SOLICITATION for services.  Responses to this advertisement will be evaluated for the purpose of developing a list of subcontractors to provide a presentation to Kaiser-Hill in October 2002.  The presentations may result in solicitation(s) being issued to one or more subcontractors for treatment/disposal of the identified Orphan Waste.  SOQ submission is limited to 50 pages.  Telephone calls will not be  accepted.  Any questions shall be submitted in writing to Karen Fairchild at FAX number (303) 966-8322 or e-mail address Karen.Fairchild@rfets.gov by close of business September 6, 2002.  Offeror's SOQ  submittals are due by 4:00 p.m. local Denver time on September 16, 2002.  All SOQ submittals shall be sent to Karen Fairchild, Kaiser-Hill Company, L.L.C., Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, Bldg. 460, 10808 Highway 93, Unit B, Golden, CO  80403-8200, faxed submittals will not be accepted.*****

<DESC>Purpose The Naval Sea Systems Command (NSSC) is issuing a Request For Information (RFI) from all interested companies, traditional defense as well as non-traditional commercial entities, who have conceptual and/or technical understanding in the areas of software and electronics development.  The information is being collected under the auspices of Open Systems Architecture (OSA); a concept that will incorporate common engineering, information, protocol, computing and interface standards such as IEEE, ANSI, ISO, IETF, TCSE, POSIX, OMG, COBRA and other standards across various shipboard environments and platforms. In addition, an understanding of electronic, computing, and operating system characteristics such as real-time determinism and boundedness, responsiveness to asynchronous events, and mechanisms for synchronization and ordering in complex systems is required. This technic al interchange will assist NSSC in establishing OSA requirements. OSAs missions include: Anti Air Warfare (AAW), Ship Based Missile Defense (SBMD), Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW) Anti Surface Warfare (ASUW), Strike (STK), Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Electronic Warfare (EW) and others.  Commercial contractors and vendors as well as defense contractors are strongly encouraged to respond to this notice.  Additional information or clarification is available upon request from Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: LCDR John H. Windom SEA02511W, 1333 Isaac Hall Avenue SE, M/S 2040, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040 at (202) 781-4965 or by e-mail at windomjh@navsea.navy.mil.  Due to the classification and/or sensitivity of the information interchange, no responses from foreign owned companies will be accepted. Company security clearances may be required for parti cipation in future OSA related activities. Description Open Systems Architecture (OSA) is a systems design approach [supported in theory and in principle by verifiable governmental testing platforms such as the Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE)], that seeks to implement open specifications for interfaces, services and supporting formats. OSA will enable properly engineered components to be utilized across a wide range of systems with minimal change requirements necessary to interoperate with components on local and remote systems. In addition, the OSA concept will promote interaction between designers, suppliers and end users that facilitates portability. Through OSA, the Government will select common standards and products in the areas of frameworks, middleware, resource management and operating systems, utilizing established and evolving industry standards, a nd under the OSA premise, avoid proprietary solutions. The Government will ultimately decide on the standards and specifications of products to be incorporated into its systems. This notice is intended to open channels of communication and promote interaction between industry, government and the cognizant technical authorities.  OSA Approach The objective of OSA submissions and subsequent meetings with industry is to define a technical and management approach to develop a non-platform specific, multi-mission, open system architecture using Government organized Integrated Product/Process Teams (IPTs), with a formal mechanism to obtain industry input for consideration by the IPTs. Responses Responses to this RFI should be limited to 10 pages or less and include supporting materials that lends for an effective evaluation of your companys technical competence and understan ding of electronic, computing, and operating system characteristics such as real-time determinism and boundedness, responsiveness to asynchronous events, and mechanisms for synchronization and ordering in complex systems.

In addition, submissions should include company history, major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience.  Responses should be submitted no later than September 13, 2002. In early October 2002, the Government will invite those companies evaluated to have the requisite technical expertise to participate in a series of collaborative meetings on OSA during the subsequent 120-day period.  This process is designed to assist the Navy in defining its future across th e entire fleet. The submitted information and data packages will not be returned, and may form the basis for future Navy requirements. This Request For Information (RFI) does not, in anyway, constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP), and as such, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for information or items solicited or for contractor attendance at future meetings.  Small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a high security United States Penitentiary (USP) and Federal Prison Camp (FPC) to be located near Tucson, Arizona.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed high security USP and FPC is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a ?campus plan? arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The high security facility and camp will have a gross building area of approximately 62,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The anticipated performance period of this project is approximately 945 consecutive calendar days after notice to proceed is issued.  The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Arizona.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Arizona to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, and subcontractors located within the State of Arizona is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration?s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about January 7, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, evaluation factors (Past Performance, Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Technical Approach) and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals  will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel Consultants and Subcontractors, Management Approach, Small Business Subcontracting, Project Schedule Development and Monitoring, and Construction Quality Control and Assurance) are significantly more important than price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

<DESC>To more fully understand the occurrence of acrylamide in the food supply, FDA is testing foods in the U.S. market to determine the presence and levels of this chemical.  This testing has two overall goals, estimating the exposure of U.S. consumers to acrylamide in food and gathering information on how different processing methods affect formation of acrylamide.  As a first objective toward these goals, a survey across foods will be undertaken to determine the range of foods that contain detectable acrylamide.  The second objective will be to estimate variability within and across food types so that more comprehensive sampling and monitoring plans can be designed.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Covance Laboratories to perform approximately 400-500 analyses of food samples that will be gathered nationwide by FDA and shipped directly to Covance.  The 400-500 sample analyses shall include method validation using standard approaches and samples provided by FDA.  Following the method validation work, the food samples that FDA sends for analysis will be either commercially prepared products purchased at supermarkets throughout the country, ingredient commodities such as dried powdered milk products purchased at distributors, or composited samples of table-ready foods prepared for FDA's Total Diet Study.  In addition, evaluation of method and product variation shall be undertaken through multiple sample composites and analyses using protocols to be determined by FDA.  The contractor shall log in the following information to send to FDA with the results: sample number assigned by FDA, date and location of sampling (information provided by FDA with samples), names of the products, lot numbers/production codes and expiration dates (where applicable), and sampling portion where applicable (e.g., center or heel slice of bread, whole breaded fish fillet as packaged).  The contractor shall take readable digital photographs of the ingredient list and bar code.  The contractor shall use a method developed by FDA for analyzing the samples, and send FDA the results in a spreadsheet provided by FDA, including the following information: analytical results in ppb, sample size, serving size, and the information logged in when the samples were received.  For commercially prepared products, the contractor shall use the serving size listed on the package as the sample size for homogenization.  The contractor shall monitor three ions for confirmation, as described in the FDA method.  The ion used for quantitation shall have a signal/noise (s/n) ratio of 10:1 or greater (s/n less than 10:1 for ion m/z 52) and the two ions used for confirmation shall have an s/n ratio of 3:1 or greater. The results shall be either a "non-detect" for samples below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) or a numerical value for samples above the LOQ. The LOQ shall be 30 ppb or better.  Other parties interested in and capable of performing this work shall submit their capability statement on or before September 4, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items under the procedures in FAR Part 12.0, Commercial Supplies and Services. This requirement is for the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB). INTERESTED PARTIES MUST FAX AND EMAIL THEIR REQUEST FOR THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO Shanda.georg@mms.gov AND Salina.Alexander@mms.gov by 12:00PM Noon, (EST), August 29, 2002. All inquiries must include the solicitation number, your full name, organization name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers. Closing date for submission of all questions concerning this RFQ, shall be sent via email no later than 4pm, September 4th, 2002. Closing date for submission of the technical and price proposal is no later than 2pm, September 20, 2002. BACKGROUND: Comprehensive molecular analysis technologies such as gene expression profiling produce vast amounts of data that can be applied in cancer research and tumor classification. However, interpreting this data requires the development, evaluation and export of analytic tools. NCICB has identified the current lack of open source tools for the analysis of gene expression data as a barrier to the advancement of science and bio-medical research. SCOPE: The contractor shall pursue the development of a vendor-independent software platform for the integration, analysis, and management of gene expression data. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this project is to provide NCICB with a flexible and extendible framework that will facilitate the development and integration of gene expression data management and integration tools. The project will involve three main aspects: 1. Development of a data representation, analysis and visualization object model. 2. Development of an extensible Java Software development kit that implements the model in an open source context. 3. A Java-based application that will implement a workbench for the analysis of gene expression data, the integration of algorithms for data analysis, and the integration of gene expression data with other biologically relevant information as provided by caBIO. The application needs to be closely integrated with NCICB's caBIO API, providing access to a subset of NCI's information resources to be defined jointly by NCICB and contractor during the course of the project. YOUR QUOTE MUST CITE in your proposal submission your tax identification number (TIN) and Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) and Standard Product Code (SIC code is no longer valid). Offerors shall provide a technical quote that includes: (1) discussion of the background, objectives, and work requirements of the statement of work as analyzed by the offeror, (2) discussion of proposed methods and techniques for completing each task, (3) discussion which supports how each task will be evaluated for full performance and acceptability of work from the offeror's viewpoint, (4) discussion of any anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, along with potential recommended approaches for their resolution, and (5) discussion on major logistical considerations. Please include a (1) staffing plan and (2)resumes for key personnel and (3) a description of your current personnel resources for this, which addresses their capabilities and experience relating to the attached Statement of Work. Please provide (4) three references of similar efforts performed by your organization for the last three years. (5) Include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address and telephone number. (References will be checked) Your quote must demonstrate that both your organization and proposed key personnel can successfully complete this project. ASSUMPTIONS, CONDITIONS, OR EXCEPTIONS: Offerors must submit, under separate cover, all (if any) assumptions, conditions, or exceptions with any of the terms and conditions of this statement of work. If not noted in this section of your quote, it will be assumed that the offeror proposes no assumptions for award, and agrees to comply with all of the terms and conditions as set forth herein. It is not the responsibility of the Government to seek out and identify assumptions, conditions, or exceptions buried within the offeror's quote. PRICING QUOTE: Your cost proposal shall be a separate volume from your technical proposal. The contractor will propose a FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACT. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is for an 8 month period beginning at award of contract : The Offeror must identify the labor category(s) to be utilized for this effort, a description of the skills and experience per category, and the firm fixed hourly rate(s) proposed, and any other proposed associated costs, for calculating the proposed cost for this effort.
