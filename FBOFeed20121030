<a href="mailto:Jeannette.Albiez@nasa.gov">Jeannette  Albiez</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA08AF13C (Ames Research Center Information Technology Support & Services 2, commonly referred to as ACITS 2) with Dell Services Federal Government (previously Perot) on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Ames Research Center's (ARC) Code I, Information Technology Directorate. The performance period will be extended for a maximum of nine (9) months (January 1, 2013  September 30, 2013), consisting of one three (3) month base performance period and six (6) one-month option periods. A contract modification reflecting this extension and resultant increase in the estimated Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) of the contract will be issued on or before December 31, 2012, the expiration date of the ACITS 2 Contract NNA08AF13C. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services under ACITS 2: IT Systems and Facilities Support: The contractor is responsible for providing System Administration, IT Security, Facility Support, Hardware/Software Maintenance, Application Management, Data Storage and Retrieval, Customer Support, Technical Planning, Analysis, and Training Network/Communications Systems and Support: The contractor is responsible for providing Network Design and Development, Network Services, Distributed Systems, Audio, Video, and Voice Communication Systems, Wireless/Emergency Communication Systems, Network/Communication Infrastructure Business Systems and Support: Financial Services, Human Resources, Security, Logistics, and Business Systems Infrastructure Scientific Computing Systems and Support: Scientific Computing consists of designing, developing, installing, modifying, configuring, operating, and maintaining software and computing systems in order to solve computationally intensive and/or complex engineering and scientific problems in support of ARC missions, programs, and projects. The contractor is responsible for providing Scientific Applications, Data Acquisition and Analysis, Modeling and Tool Development. Outreach/Informational Systems and Support: This information technology area is dominated by rich content that needs to be distributed efficiently and effectively to customers, whether they are internal to ARC, to NASA, or for the general public. These needs include web applications, information-based systems for the design, development, installation, maintenance, operations, upgrades, configuration management, archiving, customer support, and security for content-rich, IT based data systems. Examples include scientific databases and collections, geographical information systems, and digital image archive and retrieval systems, Library Systems, Conference/ Presentation/Advocacy Support. This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts to supported programs while competitive follow-on acquisition NNA10301939R is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA08AF13C, for a period of nine months, from January 1, 2013, through September 30, 2013, and increase the contract value accordingly. The current contractor, Dell Services Federal Government (previously Perot), is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for the extension. Awarding a nine-month contract to another source, at the same time procurements and associated phase-in for NASAs Agency-wide Information Technology Infrastructure Integration Program (I3P) and ARCs follow-on ACITS 3 requirement are in process, would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The purpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the current contract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement. Offers have been received for evaluation in response to NNA10301939R, the solicitation for the follow-on contract, which was set aside for small business. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 4 PM PST on November 9, 2012. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Questions regarding the extension can be sent via email to Jeannette Alabiez at jeannette.albiez@nasa.gov. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is available at http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for three inch prepolarized microphones. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from PCB Piezotronics, Inc. PCB Piezotronics is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the prototype microphones. The required microphones contain PCB Piezotronics' proprietary technology. Due to the proprietary technology and special technique and experience in fabrication of the infrasonic microphones, PCB Piezotronics is the only source that can manufacture the required microphones. The Government will save time, NRE cost, and obtain quality assurance by purchasing the items from PCB Piezotronics, Inc. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide similar microphones, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/02/12.Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), has a requirement for a multi-vessel charter (three (3) vessels) for the Biennial Bottom Trawl Surveys of Alaskan Groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, and Continental Slope of the Eastern Bering Sea.<br />AFSC requires three (3) commercial stern trawlers with experienced crew to conduct stock assessment bottom trawl surveys of groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska (2013 and 2015) and in the Aleutian Islands and the upper continental slope of the eastern Bering Sea (2014 and 2016). Each vessel will need to be completely rigged for trawling with a stern ramp and gallows or gantry, two net reels each with capacity for one standard, four-seam Poly'NorEastern bottom trawl, and be equipped with modern navigation, fish-finding, and communications electronics. The AFSC Resource Assessment &amp; Conservation Engineering Division will provide the trawls, bridles, and trawl doors. The survey areas comprise stations at depths that range 10 up to 1,200 m (6-660 fm) requiring each vessel to have split trawl winches with a minimum of 1,463 m (800 fm) of 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter steel core trawl cable in good condition and available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) but a preference for vessels having 1,830 m (1,000 fm) of 2.53 cm- (1 in-) diameter steel core trawl cable or more available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) to ensure complete coverage including the deeper sites in the study areas. An experienced skipper and a four-member fishing crew will be needed to operate each vessel and the fishing gear, while a team of six scientists will direct survey operations. The Gulf of Alaska survey spans up to 75 days and will be conducted from mid May to late July where approximately 280 tows will be conducted by each of the three vessels involved in the survey. On alternate years, two vessels will conduct trawl surveys off the Aleutian Islands that span up to 70 days, completing approximately 210 tows for each of the two vessels involved, from early June to early August. The third vessel will conduct the upper continental slope survey of the eastern Bering Sea, completing approximately 200 tows as part of the survey, also from early June to early August. Further specifications and full details will be provided in the Solicitation Package.
<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to perform the requirements for the Biennial Continental Slope Bottom Trawl Survey of Groundfish Resources in the Eastern Bering Sea, except as noted in the Statement of Work.</p>

Currently, fuel is planned to be provided via Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract. Should the DLA not be available, then fuel shall be reimbursed at cost.<br />The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this procurement is 483114 and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract. Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about December 12, 2012 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Southern California and Arizona 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Ana, CA; and Phoenix, AZ) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to one additional year, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts.  The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
  In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.219-7009 the 8(a) firm shall not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of the contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and the Contracting Officer.  Additionally FAR Clause 52.219-14 defines the limitations on subcontracting should approval to subcontract be obtained.  Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts.
 The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items). Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year.
 Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised.
 Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation.
 Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, James E.

Potential offerors will be required to demonstrate their total solution for ground up establishment and operation of a CBOC to include providing and building out space for a medical facility, staffing, and overseeing day to day operations of the CBOC.  The resultant medical care provided will be expected to be seamless in that a beneficiary cannot differentiate between the quality of care and services provided at a VA operated CBOC and the Contractor operated CBOC.  The purpose of this special notice is to announce VA's requirement to potential Contractors so that they are aware of and begin to prepare for the forthcoming issuance of the solicitation.
Additionally, VA will be utilizing this special notice to collect Contractor data which will assist VA with market research and planning.  Potential offerors are asked to submit their company's information to the Contract Specialist listed within this notice, to include the following:
"	Company Name
"	Address
"	Company Point of Contact to include email address and phone number
"	Company Size (Large, Small, Non-Profit)
"	Company Socio-Economic Status (Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Veteran Owned, Woman Owned, etc)
"	Brief Capability Statement

Interested Contractors should submit this information to the Contract Specialist by 4:30 P.M. on Friday, November 9, 2012.  Only the information listed above is required by this date.  This announcement is not a request for a complete proposal.
The type of work required may include, but is not limited to any of the disciplines listed in sector 62 of the Small Business Administration Table of Small Business Size Standards for medical services.

The corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) is 8011, classification code:  Q201.
After award of the contract the successful offeror will be required to implement their total solution to open and operate a brand new CBOC in a county where there is currently no VA presence.  The preferred area for the CBOC will be along the 119 Corridor to include the cities of Blairsville and Indiana.  Other areas within the county will be considered.  The Contractor will be required to recruit and retain staff from appropriate disciplines to ensure that services offered at the other CBOCs operated by the Altoona VAMC are offered at the Contractor's CBOC.  The Contractor will be responsible for ensuring that all patients are seen timely per VA's scheduling standards without jeopardizing patient safety. 
This special notice may be followed by subsequent special notices seeking additional information from industry.  The issuance of pre-solicitation and solicitation notices for this procurement will be released during the Summer of 2013.

<p><br />TAIS Description</p>
<p>The TSQ-221A(V)1-4 TAIS is a mobile, airspace management system providing combined air-ground operational environment management based on joint service and information system inputs. It is the Army's system of record for the integration and synchronization of Airspace Command and Control (AC2) and Air Traffic Services (ATS) within the Army Mission Command System of Systems (SoS). TAIS provides situational awareness of friendly and enemy air activity and is interoperable with joint, coalition, and civil aviation forces. It is currently employed by the United States Army in every theater of operation.</p>
<p>TAIS provides automated AC2 planning, enhanced AC2 execution, and improved enroute Air Traffic Services support across the range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict to synchronize and integrate operations in the third dimension of the battlefield. TAIS also provides civil and government inter-agency capabilities and a direct link to the Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) through interface with the Joint Force Air Component Commander's (JFACC) automated airspace planning and communication systems.</p>
<p>TAIS is directly responsive to command-level operations organizations (S-3/G-3). The TAIS system is co-located with the command and control element at the main command post for Army corps and divisions, and with Army air traffic services units organic to aviation units from brigade to theater levels. The system coordinates use of the battlefield airspace for the purpose of supporting force operations in a force projection role, while minimizing fratricide through improved operational environment synchronization including non-automated airspace users and aircraft.</p>
<p>The TAIS is a slightly modified Standard Army Shelter (SAS) mounted on an Expanded Capacity Vehicle (ECV) - High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The system consists of one TAIS shelter vehicle towing a trailer-mounted tactical generator, and one cargo HMMWV for transporting TAIS personnel and equipment such as camouflage and ground support equipment. TAIS is designed to be roll-on, roll-off capable. It can be airlifted by medium-lift helicopters and is transportable by C130 aircraft. The heart of the TAIS system is the mission computers containing unique, powerful TAIS software optimized for the AC2 and ATS missions.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released.</p>
<p>In responding to this RFI, please adhere to the numbering and areas of concentration. If you do not respond to a specific statement, please acknowledge by placing a "NA" by the applicable number.</p>
<p><br />General</p>
<p>Identify the commercial and military sales history to include the date, customers, and economic price quantities.</p>
<p><br />Desired response format</p>
<p>The Government desires that responses be submitted via email in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Windows/Office and/or Adobe Acrobat and addresses each of the above characteristics and any other important technical aspects of the product. Submit email response to: Brittany Honaker, Contract Specialist, brittany.e.honaker@us.army.mil.</p>

A-E FIRM SELECTION:
Firms responding to this announcement by submitting a SF 330 will be considered for initial evaluation.  Following initial evaluation of submitted SF330s,  discussions/interviews/negotiations will be held with at least three (3) A/E firms that are determined  "MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED" to provide the type of services required.  Selected firms will be notified by telephone or email of selection and provided further instructions.  

Selection of firms for discussions/interviews/negotiations shall be made by a Preselection Board by evaluation of PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERIA:
PRIMARY SELECTION CRITERIA in Order of Preference:  Note: Failure to address all selection criteria in sufficient detail will result in a low a rating or exclusion.  Selection criteria (See FAR Subpart 36.6 and VA Acquisition regulation 836.6) as follows:
1.	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required service.  A board will evaluate, as appropriate, the education, training, registration, certifications overall and relevant experience, and longevity with the firm of the key management and technical personnel. This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel. The lead designer in each discipline must be registered as required by FAR 36.609-4 and 52.236-25.
2.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials. A board will evaluate the specialized experience on similar projects and the technical capabilities (such as design quality management procedures, CADD, equipment resources, and laboratory requirements) of the prime firm and any subcontractors. The Board will evaluate where appropriate the effectiveness of the proposed project team (including management structure; coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors; and prior working relationships) will also be examined. 
3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  A board will consider a firm's experience with similar size projects and the available capacity of key disciplines when evaluating the capacity of a firm to perform the work in the required time. The board will consider the full potential value of any current A/E contracts that a firm has been awarded when evaluating capacity.
4.	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Information obtained for Government Past Performance Information Systems may be accessed and utilized in the evaluation process.
5.	Location in general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of the criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.  Examples of knowledge of the locality include knowledge of geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique.  
6.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
7.	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.
8.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
9.	The area of consideration for an Offeror is a 500-mile driving radius between principal place of business and the Orlando VA Medical Center, Orlando Florida 32803-8208.   Determination of mileage eligibility will be based on www.mapquest.com. .
10.	Demonstrated ability to follow Sources Sought instructions to include, clarity, accuracy and the organization and completeness of the Offeror's SF330.

All SF330 submissions must include the following information either on the SF330 or by accompanying document: 
1) Dun & Bradstreet Number  
2) Tax ID Number  
3) The e-mail address and phone number of the Primary Point of Contact 
4) A current copy of the firm's VetBiz Registry.
5) SF 330 MUST CLEARLY INDICATE THE PERCENTAGE of the contract performance cost that will be expended by the prime firm's employees and in which discipline(s) and subcontracted percentage of contract performance cost to be expended (and in what disciplines).  Any subcontracted or otherwise business entity(s) used must be identified by name, office location and size/type of business (i.e. SDVOSB, VOSB, 8(a), large, etc).  This is in order to assure compliance with FAR Clause 52.219-14(b)(1) Limitation on Subcontracting.  Failure to provide this information will deem the Firm as nonresponsive and preclude SF 330 submittal from being included in the evaluation process.

Information Used by Boards.  Boards will only consider the following information: SF330 Parts I and II; any required supplemental information; documented performance evaluations. A board will not assume qualifications which are not clearly stated in a firm's submission.  A board will review the entire submission of each firm and not excerpts or summaries. A firm will not be contacted to clarify

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit two (2) hard copies and one (1) CD - digital SF 330 for Parts I and II SF 330 for Parts I and II no later than 10:00 AM EST, December 6, 2012.  EMAIL SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

The project contributes to the Office of Rural Health's strategic plan by addressing the following:  Access of Rural Veterans to VA healthcare services, Education and Training in Rural Areas and Building Collaborations in Rural Areas.  This project requires extensive knowledge of the and spiritual needs of Veterans who have suffered physical, emotional or psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, symptoms of combat stress, depression and risk for suicide.   The period of performance is November 1, 2012 through September 30, 2013 and must be completed during Fiscal Year 13.   This proposed procurement is for a service for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than November 7, noon local time.

<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:Jason.G.Harvey@navy.mil">Jason.G.Harvey@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, has a requirement to provide acquisition and life-cycle support for existing and future Navy Navigation, Seamanship, and Shiphandling (NSS) training systems including, but not limited to: NSS Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) trainers fielded at the Surface Warfare Officer School Command (SWOS) in Newport, RI; Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Bridge simulators and Common Mission Package Trainer located at the Shore-Based Training Facility (SBTF), San Diego, CA; and NSS trainers located at various fleet concentration areas (FCAs).  Computer Sciences Corporations (CSC) Virtual Ship (VSHIP) proprietary software is the core simulation engine that supports the NSS COVE scalable family of trainers.

A Class Exception to Fair Opportunity (EFO) under the Training Systems Contract (TSC) III is being pursued to meet the requirements noted above.
  This acquisition strategy is pursuant to the authority provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part FAR 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(B), which states Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.

A sources sought was posted regarding this effort under solicitation # RFI-NSS-COVE on 8 March 2010.  Subsequent to the sources sought, the Government conducted a Business Case Analysis (BCA)/Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) to further investigate available alternatives to meet the Navy NSS training system requirements noted above.  The BCA/CBA results identified that only the NSS COVE software baseline is fully capable of satisfying the entirety of the Navys current NSS functional training requirements.
  Additionally, the BCA/CBA documented the unique and highly specialized NSS functional requirements that are exclusively available in the NSS COVE software baseline and concluded that implementation of any alternative NSS software product would be cost prohibitive as a result of the investment required to replicate the unique functionality currently available in NSS COVE.  The unique and highly specialized functionality available in the NSS COVE software baseline includes, but is not limited to: Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) bridge trainer functionality, LCS unmanned craft launch and recovery trainer functionality, integration of LCS bridge trainers with Combat Systems and Engineering Systems trainers, bridge trainer functionality enabling 90-degree look-down from ownship, enhanced voice recognition functionality, enhanced Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) functionality, enhanced radio and radar functionality, integrated Intelligent Tutor and Intelligent Aggressor functionality, and Department of Defense Information Assurance (IA) compliance.
  These BCA/CBA results coupled with the original sources sought responses have led the Government to revise its acquisition strategy and pursue the class EFO noted above.

A series of TSC III Delivery Orders are anticipated at an estimated total cost of $19M across a period of four years.  Proposed actions are anticipated to begin immediately after posting of the EFO.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  No contract or task order will be awarded on the basis of responses to this notice. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed via email to Jason Harvey at Jason.G.Harvey@navy.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 13 November 2012.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS</span> <br />AS THIS WORK WAS ISSUED AGAINST AN EXISTING AGENCY CONTRACT <br />AND IS NOW COMPLETED.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 34 is to deobligate $17,801.92 in ARRA funding from Option Period 4 as these funds are not anticipated to be needed at this time and all work is complete. The funding was associated with Work Assignments 4-100 and 4-101 each of which had a period of performance of August 24, 2011 through July 31, 2012. The objectives of these work assignments have been previously posing in www.fbo.gov. The total dollar value of the support provided in Option Period 4 for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) projects was $441,291.95. Option Period 4's period of performance ended July 31, 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) seeks interested parties for commercializing patented technology for packaging and integrating heterogeneous microsystems devices onto a single chip in a cost-effective and efficient manner. The technology is described in US patent 7,335,972. Potential applications may include microelectronics, sensors and surveillance devices.
<p>Microsystems packaging requires the assembly and interconnections of microelectronics, MEMS, photonics, RF/wireless, fluids and other microscale devices onto a system-level board or chip to form an integrated microsystems product. Because the microsystem package provides environmental protection, thermal management, testing and power distribution, the packaging controls the microsystems performance, cost, size, and reliability.</p>
<p>The stacked wafer technology provides a heterogeneously integrated, ultra-miniaturized, high performing, robust and cost-effective microsystem package. This highly integrated microsystem package can be miniaturized both in volume and footprint and provides all of the needed system level functions.</p>
<p>Sandia seeks to transfer technology for the benefit of the US industry. It is anticipated that commercial licenses may grant rights on a competitive basis to qualified interested parties for appropriate consideration. Licensing options may include grants for defined fields of use, non-exclusive rights, exclusive, or sublicensing rights.</p>
<p>Sandia National Laboratories is a multiprogram laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT SURVEY ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, REQUEST FOR QUOTE, OR INVITATION FOR BID. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</strong>
<p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this notice. The Corps of Engineers Mobile District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the MacDill Air Force Base, FL and surrounding area. This market survey is being posted for the SOF Joint Special Operations University, MacDill Air Force Base, FL.  Description of Work:  Construct a multi-story facility with precast concrete exterior wall panels.  Project includes site improvements, landscaping, communications and anti-terrorism/force protection.  Construction consists of concrete pile foundation, structural steel framing, reinforced concrete slab, fire protection, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, security system, assured telecomm architecture, HVAC and built up roof.  Additionally furniture and audio visual equipment will be included in this procurement.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Offerors are requested to respond to this Special Notice regarding PLA with the following information.</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in MacDill Air Force Base, FL and surrounding area?<br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a<br />Mobile Engineer District contract?<br />(8) Please provide a list of recent (2-5 years) construction projects in the local labor market of the project under consideration. Include the following items:</p>
<p>Project Name/Location	<br />Project Description	<br />Initial Cost Est/Actual Final Cost<br />Was the project completed on time?<br />Number of craft trades present on the project<br />PLA (Y/N)<br />Were there any challenges experienced during the project?</p>
<p>(9)Which trades are expected to be employed on this project? Are you likely to need some union skilled trades for at least part of this project?<br />(10) What market share does union labor have in the geographic area for this project or type of construction?<br />(11) Does the local market contain the sufficient number of available skilled workers for this project? Are there other projects in the vicinity going to limit the pool of skill labor available for your project?<br />(12) Has a project like this been done before in the local market?<br />(13) What investments have been made to support registered apprenticeship programs?<br /> (14) Have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by the public sector in this geographic region? Have PLAs been used on this type of project in other regions?<br />(15) Which CBAs are likely to expire during the course of the project under consideration that might cause delays?<br />(16) How do open shop and union wage rates influence prevailing wage rates in the local market and compare to Davis Bacon rates? What impact does unionization in the local market have on wages?<br />(17) Could a PLA contribute to cost savings in any of the following ways?<br /> -Harmonization of shifts and holidays between the trades to cut labor costs?<br /> -Minimization disruptions that may arise due to expiration of CBA?<br /> -Availability of trained, registered apprentices, efficient for highly skilled workforce?<br /> -Allowing for changes in apprentice to journeyman ration.<br />-Serving as management tool that ensure highly skilled workers from multiple trades are coordinated in the most efficient way.<br />-Others?<br />(18) Could a PLA minimize risk and contribute to greater efficiency in any of the following ways?<br /> -Mechanisms to avoid delays<br /> -Complying with Davis Bacon and other labor standards, safety rules and EEO and OFCP laws.<br />-Ensuring a steady supply of skilled labor in markets with low supply or high competition for workers.<br />(19) Are there ways in which a PLA might increase costs on this particular project?</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Special Notice no later than 14 November 2012.  Mail, or E-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Mobile, Attn: CESAM-CT/Ms. Rosemary Hall, P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628; E-mail - rosemary.c.hall@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>The 88th Communications Squadron has a requirement for the acquisition of hardware maintenance for Hewlett Packard (HP) 4730 Printers. The 88th CS currently utilizes 24 each HP 4730 printers on the network systems. These printers are used on all the networks that are supported by the 88th CS. . In order to ensure that these printers are maintained in accordance with manufacturer's specifications, and to maintain continuous support coverage, the manufacturer requires that certified HP maintenance providers be utilized. The 88th CS has continued maintenance support with HP since the procurement of these printers. The use of non-certified technicians would invalidate any warranty coverage and place continued operations of these printers in jeopardy should any of the supported printers fail. In addition, maintaining existing coverage for these printers eliminates the potential costs of having to purchase new, replacement libraries.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />COMMANDANT (GG-9131)<br />United States Coast Guard<br />2100 2nd Street SW, Stop 7112<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

Request for Information (RFI)<br />Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Design Study Plan
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) and Special Operations Forces Directorate, ISR Sensors and Foreign Military Sales Division (AFLCMC/WIN), Contracting Offices 2530 Loop Road West, Rm 215, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7106, United States.</p>
<p>Request for Information: Airborne LIDAR Design Study Plan</p>
<p>Synopsis: Recent success with 3-Dimensional (3-D) LIDAR technology in Iraq and Afghanistan and the current maturity level of the technology indicate a need to investigate designs and a more definitive way-ahead for future Air Force airborne LIDAR capabilities. The Geospatial Intelligence Capabilities Working Group has initiated a study on the utility of airborne 3-D LIDAR in support of the Air Force ISR mission. The Air Force mission includes providing 3-D LIDAR data/products to several users within Department of Defense. The overall objective of this study is to identify potential materiel solutions, design concepts, key technologies, and cost/schedule/performance parameters for an enduring DoD LIDAR capability. Additionally, the Air Force is interested in the different types of products derived from airborne LIDAR data and how they could support or enhance Air Force operations. Air Force operations can include supporting DoD military and peacetime operations such as disaster relief and assessment.</p>
<p>Purpose: The intent of this RFI is to solicit information on airborne LIDAR technology and the capabilities of industry to produce LIDAR systems and products. Systems should meet the study operating conditions and performance requirements in support of both airborne tactical and strategic missions. This is a Sources Sought announcement only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up request for information, if applicable.</p>
<p>Background: 3-D LIDAR systems and products are the primary focus for the study. System parameters either measured or calculated from current LIDAR sensors, which are of interest, include:<br />&bull; Size, weight, and power (SWaP) of the system<br />&bull; Operating range<br />&bull; Maximum slant angle as a function of altitude<br />&bull; Cross-range ground sampling distance<br />&bull; Range-precision<br />&bull; Collection rate and platform flight constraints<br />&bull; Visibility/atmospheric conditions (e.g., 20 km, mid-latitude summer atmospheric model)<br />&bull; Probability of detection against 10% Lambertian target<br />&bull; Intensity information (if measured)<br />&bull; Multiple return capability and range resolution (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A baseline assumption for the study was that any LIDAR concept would deliver the required performance mounted on the MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft for medium altitude missions, and on the RQ-4B Global Hawk, and/or the U-2 for high altitude missions. The system might be mounted in either a pod (preferred for the MQ-9 application) or in an internal configuration. For the high altitude missions, it should be noted that an internally- mounted sensor system is expected. It is anticipated that the LIDAR systems would be required to operate at the nominal altitudes and airspeeds at which these aircraft normally fly. For the purposes of this RFI, altitudes of 20,000 ft and 50,000 ft above ground level are of interest.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the functional concepts or capabilities available within the industry, the Air Force is also interested in understanding the maturity of the technologies needed to support those concepts. For the purposes of this study, the focus is on mature/maturing technologies or operational capabilities that can meet Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL-6) within 24-36 months. However, the Air Force would also be interested in an assessment of technologies that require more than 36 months to reach TRL-6, but might provide improved performance, reduced SWaP, etc.</p>
<p>Responses: In responding to this RFI, interested parties are requested to submit a short, 3-5 page, white paper. The white paper should describe the LIDAR sensing mode or design that the offeror uses in the systems they produce, the experience the offeror has in producing those types of systems, and integrating them onto airborne platforms. The offeror is also requested to identify any less mature technology that could be further developed and how those technologies might impact the systems that the offeror produces. Responses should include known information regarding:</p>
<p>1. Operating range<br />2. System SWaP<br />3. Mission profile (open area imaging, mountainous terrain, heavily foliated terrain) <br />4. Flexibility in trading; <br />a. cross-range Ground Sample Distance (GSD) for coverage rate, and <br />b. collection rate for penetration through foliage of varying density and any procedures used to enhance &lsquo;below foliage' imagery (e.g. the stacking of multiple looks)<br />5. The size of raw data files and memory requirements for storing mission data (use a nominal 10 km2 frame size to estimate sizes) <br />6. On-board processing architectures for near real-time downlink of 1 km2 areas nominal GSDs of 20 cm.<br />7. Estimated cost and development/integration schedule</p>
<p>Interested, qualified sources are invited to respond to this Sources Sought announcement by submitting information as outlined below. Please do not submit a company brochure or other marketing material. Please submit the following information:</p>
<p>1. Professional qualifications of staff. Information shall document the staff's experience in the development and implementation of airborne 3-D LIDAR systems.<br />2. Specialized recent experience and technical competence of the firm in airborne 3-D LIDAR sensor and system development.<br />3. Information on your firm's ability to support the integration LIDAR systems onto an airborne platform and the use of LIDAR to collect 3-D data. Include project title, project description, dollar value, and a point of contact with phone number and email address.</p>
<p>NOTE: Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is under contract to develop and publish the Airborne LIDAR Design Study Plan. GTRI's contract includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest clause governing the use of the proprietary information of other companies. This clause requires GTRI to enter into company-to-company agreements to (1) protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company and (2) to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.

All proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets Qualification Requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The Government is NOT required to delay contract award to review a pending Source Approval Request (SAR). Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit SARs AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If the Government has not completed review of a SAR when the contract is awarded the SAR will be retained and the source will be reviewed for possible source approval for future awards. First Article testing is required to ensure the reliability and integrity of the item and operational safety of the weapon system that uses it. First Article testing is waived if the offeror is the prime contractor, Pratt and Whitney.

Note: Determination of acceptability of 'or similar' items may only be made by the engineering office initiating this First Article requirement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to contact the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. technical specifications, etc.) may be requested, pricing shall be entered in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the awardee may be required to complete the solicitation documents at the time of award. <BR> <BR>This is a "brand name or equal" procurement. To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must: (1) meet the salient functional, physical, and performance characteristics of the brand name product (see attached product specifications); (2) clearly identify the brand name and make or model number; (3) INCLUDE DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make to the product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of the information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. Please note that an "equal" offer will not be considered responsive unless the offeror submits product literature that allows the Contracting Officer to determine compliance with the specifications of the requested product. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation <BR> <BR>To be considered for award, the quoted gas machine and accessories must be 100% compatible with the Draegar Innovian Anesthesia Record Keeping (ARK)System.  With each quote, offerors shall submit documentation that certifies that the quoted items are 100% compatible with the ARK. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for implementation of a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the radar pedestal in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D.
<p>GENERAL: WSR-88D Pedestal Description: The National Weather Service (NWS) maintains and operates 165 (qty) NEXRAD WSR-88D radars throughout the continental United States, and an additional 15 radars outside the continental United States. The radars were installed between 1992 and 1997. The WSR-88D was designed in the 1980's with a projected 20-year service life. With an average run-time of 17 years, the pedestals are expected to begin experiencing metal fatigue failures in the gears, gear boxes and other mechanical systems. Pedestal motors, slip rings and other electromechanical devices have been refurbished and put back into service, but the time is approaching when these aging parts can no longer be economically refurbished and they must be replaced with new hardware. A Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the fleet of radars is being considered. Although the basic pedestal design will remain the same, the NWS will use the SLEP as an opportunity to introduce new technology into the design given the return on investment is obvious.</p>
<p>This SLEP will require the disassembly of the antenna and connecting waveguide and removal of the radome prior to removal of the pedestal and immediately replacing with a remanufactured, overhauled/certified pedestal, also provided by the SLEP contractor. The SLEP contractor shall provide all cranes, personnel, resources necessary to remove, replace, and transport all material required to support this task. The SLEP contractor will disassemble and evaluate the condition of each pedestal and make recommendations regarding replacement, overhaul, etc. of each pedestal element. Upon authorization from the Government, the SLEP contractor will complete the actions approved by the Government. The NWS will provide available spare WSR-88D pedestals to begin the replacement and factory refurbishment process on a round-robin basis.</p>
<p>The major pedestal components subject to evaluation, overhaul, or replacement include: <br /><br />&bull; Pedestal Cables<br />&bull; Azimuth Bull Gear<br />&bull; Elevation Bull Gear<br />&bull; Elevation Bearing<br />&bull; Gear Box<br />&bull; Servo Motor<br />&bull; Data Package<br />&bull; Slip Rings<br />&bull; Azimuth Rotary Joint<br />&bull; Elevation Rotary Joint</p>
<p>Responses to this market survey must include; (1) Company profile, (2) a description of similar work performed under other contracts, (3) a statement regarding current industrial and logistical capabilities relative to this requirement, (4) customer points of contact for similar work cited in (2) above, and cost summary for similar work cited in (2) above. Additional information on the proposed WSR-88 SLEP program can be found at:</p>

<p>This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. All information should be submitted to the attention of Chad Hepp, NOAA Contracting Officer, via email at Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov Responses should be received no later than the date indicated on this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The E-2C Hawkeye provides carrier-based and land-based airborne early warning and command and control to Carrier Strike Groups and joint operations ashore. On board crew communications are conducted using the AIC-14A Intercommunications System (ICS). The C-2645D/AIC-14A ICS Control Panel (Master Interphone Control Panel) and the multi-aircraft version of the C-4952, known as the C-12156/AIC-14A ICS Radio Select Panel (R/T Interphone Control Panel), have been identified as significant degraders for the E-2C fleet, experiencing high failure rates due to reduction in reliability as the systems age. In addition, repair costs for these components are expected to increase significantly due to impending obsolescence.
<p>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INITIAL ORDER AND THE FOLLOW-ON ORDER: : In September 2004, DMEA/MEE awarded Multiple Advanced Technology Support Program III (ATSP3), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts with a combined ceiling of $4.6 billion; a five (5)-year tasking period, and two 5-year options through September 2019. <br />This task is a logical follow-on to the ATSP3 task 10-089 C-2A (Delivery Order 0176), which was posted for fair opportunity; however, only Raytheon proposed. The previous order was awarded on 21 Sep 2010 for $4,500,000 and was modified on 16 Feb 2012 to add $423,338 for a total ceiling of $4,923,338. The modification was accomplished to correct the prototype dimensions due to error in the government supplied documentation. The current task uses the C-2A design as a basis of design and testing methods developed for the C-2A task will also be used for this task. Qualification testing requirements will be fulfilled by similarity to the qualification testing done for the C-2A task. <br />RATIONALE FOR FOLLOW-ON EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY:<br />Raytheon's inherent familiarity, unique skills and capabilities are derived from their development of the predecessor C-2A task. Further, throughout the course of numerous development, testing, and fielding efforts Raytheon has cultivated a uniquely, highly qualified workforce possessing the skill-set necessary to efficiently and expeditiously conduct this task. The last facet of Raytheon's unique qualifications resides in Raytheon's extensive facilities located at its Indianapolis facilities housing program management, engineering, systems engineering and functional test resources.<br />Design, qualification test, aircraft ground test data developed on the C-2A will be shared with the E-2C task. The sharing of this data along with expertise and experience gained on the C-2A task will yield better and more cost effective E-2C units in a compressed schedule. Because of the sharing of this test data, the Government will save at least $250,000 for the Qualification Testing.</p>
<p>An award of this requirement to a source other than Raytheon, would also cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's need. Efforts to award this requirement competitively would require spending at least $350,000 for replication of engineering development, test labs, test equipment, documentation, manufacturing processes and testing under the E-2C aircraft.</p>
<p>Due to the learning curve, a new start would include technical risk of the ICS failing to perform properly when integrated with E-2C. Raytheon's previous expertise will allow them to perform successful integration of the ICS with the E-2C aircraft as well as demonstrate capabilities through aircraft ground test. If another contractor was selected, the integration of the ICS would cause unacceptable schedule and cost risks.</p>
<p>lt is in the Government's best interest to leverage Raytheon's current successful experience to ensure the best possible technical performance, lowest cost, and lowest schedule risk for this requirement.</p>

<DESC>Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity<br />Advanced Technology Support Program III (ATSP3) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Delivery Order Contract
<p>I. Contracting Activity: Defense Microelectronics Activity, Contracting Office (DMEA/MEE), McClellan, CA<br />II. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:<br />The Naval Air Command (NAVAIR) has requirement for timely deployment and aircraft integration of the Smart Multifunction Color Display (SMFCD), as a limited production effort (Contractual Engineering Task (CET)) 12-228. This new requirement of 62 units will bridge the gap from system development completion until a full production contract may be established. This requirement will be procured as a cost-plus-fixed fee logical follow-on delivery order, estimated at $17,225,000. The delivery order period of performance will be 14 months from award, and is anticipated to begin in May 2012 (concurrent with existing developmental flight testing) and be completed by July 2013.<br />The requirement will consolidate all the aircraft survivability information, all the blue force tracking situation information and some time sensitive threat information onto one display. Currently, all of this data is available to the aircrew; however, not having the data on one display requires the aircrew to look at several different places in the cockpit to review this information. The Command desires to reduce the number of lost aircraft and personnel due to poor situational awareness experienced in flights operating in Afghanistan and Iraq. Raytheon, performing under their initial delivery order will modify the existing SMFCD system to meet the updated requirements, integrate a prototype SMFCD system into a CH-53E helicopter, perform SMFCD qualification and aircraft developmental flight testing, build and install prototypes as a initial production effort, and validate and verify assets. <br />III. Description of the Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Need (including the estimated value):<br />The U.S. Marine Corps has an immediate need to deploy 60 of the integrated SMFCD's on a rotational basis linked to squadron deployment. Two (2) additional units will be integrated into trainer systems. The delivery order will provide a stop gap limited production run of these 62 units. The units will then be integrated into the CH-53E aircraft and trainer systems on an aggressive schedule that is rotationally based upon squadron deployment and training over a 14 month period beginning in September 2012. <br />The current SMFCD production ramp is estimated to be five (5) to six (6) months to first article testing. The first month production is expected to produce four (4) units, ramping to a steady state of eight (8) units until completion of the limited production run. The first product integration is estimated to begin six (6) to seven (7) months from award of the delivery order. The initial production and integration requirement is estimated to be $17,225,000 (using Navy FY11 17506, Aircraft Procurement funds) provided by NAVAIR, who manages funding for all Marine aircraft programs. The funding is available until completely expended. <br />IV: Identification of the Exception to Fair Opportunity (Authority Cited):<br />FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), the delivery order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, wherein all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the original order.</p>
<p>V: Supporting Rationale for Exception to Fair Opportunity:<br />BACKGROUND: In September 2004, DMEA/MEE awarded Multiple Advanced Technology Support Program III (ATSP3), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts with a combined ceiling of $4.6 billion; a five (5)-year tasking period, and two 5-year options through September 2019 (see Attachment 1). <br />Late in Calendar Year 2010, NAVAIR came to DMEA/MEE with an urgent requirement (CET 11-127) for initial design, non recurring engineering work and testing to replace the existing CH-53E Pilot Display Units (PDUs) with the Smart Multifunction Color Display (SMFCD). DMEA sought competition on the requirement under their existing ATSP3 ID/IQ wherein all contractors were given a fair opportunity to be considered for award. Raytheon Systems is the only ATSP3 ID/IQ contractor who provided a proposal. The proposal included an excellent technical approach, was determined to be fair and reasonable. The original delivery order was awarded on 8 February 2011, under Contract Number H94003-04-D-0006, Delivery Order number 0182, in the amount of $9,713,900. The delivery order was modified to add Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) capability on 14 September 2011 in the amount of $4,689,370 for a total delivery order ceiling of $14,403,270.<br />RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INITIAL ORDER AND THE FOLLOW-ON ORDER<br />Under the initial delivery order, Raytheon has previously developed proprietary data rights for items such as the Interface Control and the SMFCD Electronics Architecture. Use of those proprietary rights is required for performance under the follow-on delivery order.</p>
<p>RATIONALE FOR FOLLOW-ON EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY<br />a. Due to Raytheon's proprietary data rights under the SMFCD, it is not considered viable (in terms of technical approach, cost and schedule) to solicit and award the CET 12-228 requirement to another firm. The CET 11-127 data/documentation and processes are proprietary to Raytheon. No other supplier (contractor) is capable or would be capable of integrating the CET 12-228 requirements for production and integration of the SMFCD (CET 11-127) system into the CH-53E aircraft, and produce, integrate and test this system on the aircraft.</p>
<p>b. An award to a source other than Raytheon, would also result in substantial duplication of cost (estimated at $5.5 million) to the Government to acquire or redevelop the Interface Control and SMFCD Electronics Architecture. In response to the Government's data rights questions, <br />Raytheon provided a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate of approximately $5.5 million for the acquisition of these data rights. The cost of redevelopment would be the same <br />order of magnitude. Unless the data rights are acquired or redeveloped, cost in both time and money to develop a competitive source would be prohibitive. Additionally, the lifetime sustainment cost is estimated to be $5.16 million, which supports a sole-source decision rather than procuring the data and developing a competitive source. See attachment for operation and supportability costs.</p>
<p>c. An award of this requirement to a source other than Raytheon, would also cause <br />unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's need. The integration of CET 12-228 into the SMFCD is essential to troop deployment. Redevelopment of the Interface Control and SMFCD Electronics Architecture, from a schedule perspective, will be in excess of six (6) months. Efforts to award this requirement competitively would require replication of engineering<br />development, test labs, test equipment, documentation, manufacturing processes and testing under the CH-53E aircraft.</p>
<p>d. Due to the learning curve, a new start would include high technical risk of the SMFCD failing to perform properly when integrated with CH-53E. Raytheon's previous expertise will allow them to perform successful integration of the SMFCD with the CH-53E aircraft as well as demonstrate capabilities and reliability through flight test. This delivery order can be duplicated only with unacceptable increased schedule and cost risk. No other contractor can meet the requirements for production and integration within the CH-53E acceptable cost and performance risk.</p>
<p>e. lt is in the Government's best interest to leverage Raytheon's current successful experience, ensuring the best possible technical performance, lowest cost, and lowest schedule risk is realized during performance of this new requirement.</p>
<p>f. Performance under the initial delivery order has been very good despite complex requirements of software with the existing system dependencies. The performance is expected to continue in a very close interdependent manner with the requirements under the follow-on delivery order. This will be accomplished by allowing a schedule overlap between the end of the design effort (under the initial delivery order 0182) with the follow-on delivery order limited production ramp. This will allow the contractor to flow through design data to the limited production effort at the earliest point possible. The contractor will also gain knowledge and experience in the integration of this specific system into the aircraft that can be effectively leveraged with the Marine troop deployment/training schedule. The period of performance for delivery order 0182 ends on 31 August 2012. Since CET 12-228 will provide a limited number of prototypes and mission essential integration and testing of the SMFCD, the work under the new delivery order is planned for completion by 31 July 2013.</p>
<p>g. Raytheon's experience with the SMFCD system and production capabilities allows them to provide an aggressive ramp to limited production and successful integration of the system to meet this urgent need.</p>
<p>OTHER ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:<br />Competition under the existing ATSP3 ID/IQ contracts was considered. However, upon further analysis and program definition, it became clear that due to proprietary data rights, Raytheon is the only feasible alternative.</p>
<p>IMPACT IF THIS EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY IS NOT APPROVED:<br />lf not approved, the Government would essentially have to redesign or acquire the Interface Control and SMFCD Electronics Architecture from Raytheon. As annotated above, the estimated cost to acquire those data rights is $5.5 million. It would also result in additional testing prior to integration into the CH-53E, thereby precluding integration prior to troop deployment as early as September 2012. Any delay in approval will increase the schedule risk associated with the urgent CH-53E SMFCD deployment, which will increase the likelihood of personnel and aircraft loss or damage.</p>
<p>VI. Effort to Obtain Competition: None. Based on information in above paragraph 5, competition for this action was not feasible. <br />VII. Actions to Increase Competition: Future requirements will be procured by the Naval Air Command.. DMEA will not be involved in any future production contract actions for this program.<br />VIII. Market Research: Market research was accomplished by analyzing the ATSP3 contractors' capabilities and expertise to determine which contractors could meet the technical, cost and schedule requirements of this program. All contractors, other than Raytheon, would need to re-develop the technical requirements; or the government would have to acquire the proprietary Interface Control Document and the MFCD Electronics Architecture data owned by Raytheon to complete this effort. The cost and schedule impacts required to achieve that re-development would be prohibitive and add unacceptable risk to the program. <br />IX. Interested Sources: No other known sources.<br />X. Other Facts Supporting the Exception to Fair Opportunity: None.</p>
