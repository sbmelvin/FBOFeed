<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a TCON Thruster computer software program, including:  (1) Source code written in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. The Source code is to be delivered on a CD.  (2) A license to modify and distribute the program freely.	Other requirements:  (1) 1 day of instruction on the use of the program and the logic of the source code, to be provided within 60 days of the software purchase, at NASA/GSFC's convenience.  (2) 8 hours of telephone support, within 90 days of the software purchase, at NASA/GSFC's convenience.	(3) The software must be Y2K compliant.	NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Frederick A. Costello, Inc. The TCON software is proprietary software developed and sold exclusively by Frederick Costello as a user friendly package, capable of importing CAD models of spacecraft structures to allow for quick analysis of thruster plume interactions with the structure. Frederick Costello's software package is the only package currently available for importing the CAD models of spacecraft structures. Frederick Costello's software package is the only package that has been verified to be accurate on several NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center missions, which include TRMM, MAP, Triana, and EOS. Other plume analysis approaches use more costly CFP software packages, which require extensive training and modeling experience to implement and to allow for easy import of actual spacecraft CAD models.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. The Authority is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 8, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has a requirement for the lease of an aircraft hangar (capable of safely and securely housing a Gulfstream II) with accompanying storage and office space within a 25 mile radius of the MSFC in Huntsville, Alabama.  The lessor should also be capable of moving a Gulfstream II into and out of the hangar facility, fueling the aircraft, and providing a passenger waiting area suitable for executive business travel of approximately 15 individuals on a per trip basis. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the leased hangar space and associated services from Signature Flight Support operating at the Huntsville International Airport in Huntsville, Alabama.  The authority for this sole-source award is FAR 6.302-1 which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	Competition is impractical because there is currently no known building of sufficient size within a 25 mile radius of MSFC aside from that owned and operated by Signature Flight Support that can house the NASA/MSFC Gulfstream II. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 9, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit capabilities/qualifications as identified above. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The solicitation will be available at http:// ideasec.nbc.gov on December 24, 2003. A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The National Parks Service is currently using the Pitney Bowes postage meters in all of its park areas for outgoing mail. Many NPS areas are in remote locations, the Park Service requires postal meters which are capable of being set from a remote location. It is a logistical impracticality for many park areas to take their meters to a post office each time additional postage funds are needed. Some of these areas such as Pacific National Park and Virgin Islands are located in overseas areas which also need to be served via phone modems for postage requirements.   Pitney Bowes is the only company that maintains a worldwide automated setting network for the type of meters the used by NPS. Maintenance to this equipment is provided by Pitney Bowes company- trained company employed personnel who are located at 720 sites throughout the United States. In addition, Pitney Bowes equipment is manufactured in the United States, further adding to the ability to support field service requirements with prices and practices consistent with one corporate vision and policy.                                              A determination not to open the requirement to competition based on responses received to this notice is solely within the discretion of NPS.  Questions must be faxed at (202) 354-1990 or emailed to Billy.Rowland@nps.gov. In order to download a copy of the solicitation the vendor is asked to register their company with the electronic commerce website. Be prepared with your company's DUNS number, available from Dun and Bradstreet at 1-888-546-0024, and your Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN).  To save time the vendor should pre- register by logging onto the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at the internet site http://www.ccr.gov. gov.  POC: Billy Rowland Contracting Officer National Parks Service Office Of Contracting and Procurement 1201 Eye St. NW, Washington DC 20005.TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.    The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation. This announcement does not constitute the solicitation. End of Announcement.

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to successfully award a contract for the demolition and construction of a new two-story interior of Building 175, located at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC.

Building 175 was constructed in 1919 as steel framed industrial high-bay shop area with a monitor on the roof and large windows (later filled-in with brick) on the three sides facing Parsons Avenue and N and 10th Streets.  The building is located in a prominent area close to the main entrance to the Washington Navy Yard.  Historic preservation concerns were guiding the appearance of the renovated facility. 

This work includes the demolition of most interior components of a historically significant existing building.  The new work consists of constructing a second floor on existing joists within the building envelope, opening the bricked-in windows and installing curtain wall type in-fills, reglazing the monitor, installing new building environmental systems, and finishing the interior for a medical clinic on the first floor and a dental clinic on the second floor.  It also includes the replacement of most of the existing exterior brick and construction of a stair and elevator tower on N Street to serve
as main patient entrance.


This procurement is UNRESTRICTED and the resultant contract will be acquired through Source Selection Procedures.  Award will be based on best value to the government considering price and non-price factors stated in the solicitation.  The approximate Solicitation Release Date is 12 January 2003. This solicitation will be posted to the ESOL Website http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Contractors are encouraged to register for the solicitation when downloading from the NAVFAC
 E-Solicitation website. Only registered contractors will be notified by email when amendments to the solicitation are issued. The site visit is tentatively scheduled for 27 January 2003.  The approximate closing date for this solicitation is 12 February 2003. The cost range for this requirement is more than $10,000,000.00.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is   236220.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for  an 8 kW PEM fuel cell stack to support a developmental rover testbed project.  This acquisition involves the purchase of one fuel cell stack that operates on hydrogen and oxygen delivered 20 weeks after award of contract with one design review.  Reliability and durability are the highest priorities of this fuel cell procurement.  Preference for this contract award will be given to vendors with reliable experience with PEM fuel cell stacks that operate on hydrogen and oxygen (not air).  The power plant system requires the fuel cell to produce at least 8 kW at a minimum of 48 Volts for at least one hour and 4 kW for at least 10 hours and be capable of responding to load demands increasing from 300 Watts to 8 kW in less than one second.  The power plant also requires the fuel cell stack to weigh less than 100 lbs, be capable of water cooling, include instrumentation for temperature and individual cell voltages, operate at anode and cathode pressures between 5 and 20 psig, and contain bus plates electrically isolated from the endplates.  The fuel cell stack will eventually be operated with reformed methane and therefore membranes and catalyst materials should be capable of tolerating up to 10 ppm of CO in the hydrogen.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to cancel the presolicitation notice for DTCG83-04-Q-3WF131.  Because of an increase in the Government's estimated cost to perform the project, the solicitation will not be issued under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB);   subject to Sealed Bidding procedures.  The solicitation number will be changed to DTCG83-04-B-3WF141.  In addition to the solicitation being changed from an RFQ to an IFB, the solicitation will be changed from a Total Small Business Set-Aside to a Total HUB-Zone Set-Aside.  The Government reasonably anticipates that 2 or more certified HUB-Zone concerns will be interested in bidding on this project.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:
The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. 
** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **
Source of Occupational Title and Descriptions:
The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations," Fourth Edition, January 1993, as amended by the Third Supplement, dated March 1997, unless otherwise indicated.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}
Conformance Process:
The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.
The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate). 
2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.
3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.
5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 
6) The contractor informs the affected employees.
Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.  
When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.  Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

<DESC>RESPONSE DUE DATE EXTENDED TO JANUARY 15, 2004

The NHLBI plans to release a Request for Proposals for a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center to establish a patient and device data registry to track patients receiving mechanical circulatory support for end-stage heart failure.  The registry will also establish a tissue and blood repository.  The registry will benefit the research and practice communities as well as federal agencies concerned with patient safety and oversight.

The NHLBI would like information from academic institutions, professional groups and private industries that develop and apply mechanical circulatory support devices to identify optimum parameters to establishing a registry and ways to design and implement an effective program.  Specifically, NHLBI seeks advice concerning core information to be collected, concerns and solutions to protect rights of patients, facilities, providers and support teams and manufacturers.  Also important are independence of data analysis, access to data and data sharing, and potential strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.  Ways to involve private industry without undermining the independence of the program governance are also sought.

BACKGROUND:

Over the past two decades, mechanical circulatory support devices, such as ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts, have been developed to augment or supplant failing myocardial performance.  This therapy has been used successfully as a bridge to heart transplantation, a bridge to recovery, and, most recently, as destination therapy for intractable heart failure.  Although cardiac transplantation offers life-saving therapy for selected patients, its use is limited by a supply of donor organs that currently meets less than one-tenth the need, and which is steadily decreasing.  As a consequence, the number of mechanical circulatory support device implantations has increased from a cumulative total U.S. experience of 1,000 in 1990, to approximately 1,000 per year in 2000.  The latter figure is expected to increase greatly following the 2002 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a destination therapy device and the October 1, 2003, CMS approval for reimbursement for this indication.  Despite favorable survival and quality of life outcomes, mechanical devices have severe and sometimes life-threatening complications associated with infection, thrombosis, and device failure.  Development of new procedures and devices to reduce these complications would be expedited by a systematic, independent analysis of mechanical support device implantation procedures and outcomes.  Cooperation among the federal agencies involved in the development, regulation, and use of circulatory support devices, including NHLBI, FDA and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), will permit development of standard reporting of patient characteristics, indications, implantation procedures, and adverse events.  Such cooperation will facilitate clinical evaluation and patient management and aid better device development. 

Heart failure is a malignant cardiac disorder affecting over 4.5 million people in the U.S.; it is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis, exacting substantial morbidity and mortality, and health care resources and costs.  Current therapies improve symptoms, but have only a modest impact on long-term survival. The NHLBI-supported Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) study evaluated the implantation of left ventricular assist devices and optimal medical therapy, versus optimal medical therapy alone, in randomly assigned end-stage heart failure patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation.  REMATCH results demonstrated better survival and quality of life in patients who received the assist devices.  Because the cost of mechanical assistance in REMATCH was similar to transplantation, mechanical assistance offers an important therapeutic alternative to transplantation.  Nevertheless, device therapy can be improved.  Better patient selection, device design and patient management are possible, but require careful evaluation that would be facilitated by data centralization and independent analysis.  A tissue and blood repository would encourage studies of heart failure using cutting-edge approaches, such as genomics and proteomics, the response to mechanical assistance, and the mechanisms underlying the reported improvement in native heart function with these devices.  Information obtained by the registry will aid in the development of improved surgical implantation procedures and patient management paradigms, and also point the way for future research studies.

The registry will support a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center, a tissue and blood repository, and a scientific advisory group to develop protocols for standard procedures to collect patient and device data, tissue, and blood samples for genomic and proteomic investigations.  Registry data would be analyzed to permit understanding of clinical outcomes, complications, and associated therapies.  The registry would serve as a resource to encourage research investigations using centrally collected tissue or data, and would provide information critical to the design of clinical investigations or trials of specific therapeutic interventions.  The proposed registry would build on the progress of the existing registries, and facilitate transfer of federally required data sets without compromising confidentiality of proprietary information.

INFORMATION REQUESTED 

NHLBI seeks comments and suggestions as requested below.

1. Patient outcomes are determined by patient characteristics, surgical provider and facilities support, and device performance.  Please suggest data elements you consider essential for collection by the registry.

2. Abstracting hospital and out-patient data and checking accuracy of submitted data will be required.  Please provide concerns you have about the registry collecting data on patients, devices, hospitals and medical providers.  Please suggest ways the NHLBI can design registry protocols to minimize those concerns.

3. Please identify ways for NHLBI to encourage industry to participate and support the registry.

4. Please suggest ways to design the registry so that participants do not have duplicate reporting requirements.

5. Please provide methods to ensure accuracy and security of data in the registry.

6. Please suggest strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.
 
7. We would appreciate any additional views or opinions that you think would be useful to develop a registry that will improve outcomes for patients receiving mechanical circulatory support.

RESPONSE AND PROCESS:

Responses in any of the areas are welcome; respondents should not feel compelled to address all items.  Please respond no later than December 30, 2003.  We look forward to your thoughts, opinions and suggestions and hope that you will share this document with your colleagues.  All responses will be kept confidential.  Thank you for your assistance.

<DESC>BACKGROUND.  Under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (AMFA), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct), the federal government has demonstrated its resolve to reduce petroleum usage by promoting the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs).   The objectives of the legislation are to clean up the environment, achieve energy independence, and improve national security. Through Titles III, IV, and V of EPAct, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) is charged with developing and implementing rules in support of the above legislation to require the acquisition of AFVs by federal agency fleets, certain state government fleets, and private alternative fuel provider fleets.  In addition to this, Section V of EPAct directs DoE to assess whether sufficient progress is being made towards achieving the goals of EPAct, and, if not, to determine if and how the goals and/or the existing rules should be changed (e.g., expand covered fleets to include municipal and private fleets other than alternative fuel providers). 


ACTIVITIES. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) provides technical and analytical support to help DoE implement various parts of AMFA and EPAct.  NREL is seeking organizations to assist it in this effort, specifically as it relates to state and fuel provider fleets, by participating in the following categories of activities: 1) annual reporting; 2) fleet communications; 3) fleet information development and dissemination; and 4) compliance analysis.  Examples of specific activities include: providing technical assistance  to covered and potentially covered fleets on the annual reporting process; analyzing fleet data for  quality assurance and identification of trends and issues; providing data for the NREL database that tracks AFV purchases for each fleet; performing queries of the report database for required status reports and other programmatic needs; preparing content for  fleet guidance and general awareness documents; reviewing interactive web-based tools that provide EPAct-related information for fleet managers and government officials and allow web-based submission of data and reports; attending designated meetings and conferences and preparing presentations and meeting summary notes for same.


QUALIFICATIONS. Organizations that respond to this Sources Sought request will have the following capabilities, attributes, and skills: 1) extensive knowledge of the EPAct legislation and regulations pertaining to AFV acquisition requirements for state and fuel provider fleets; 2) extensive experience with quality assured data entry and customer service via internet and phone assistance; 3) extensive knowledge of the alternative fuels industry; 4) knowledge of and experience with internet-accessible, Unix-based Oracle databases and associated web forms; 5) high comfort level in working on the Internet and high quality access/connectivity to the Internet.


RESPONSE. Respondents will supply contact information and a summary of their qualifications (not to exceed seven pages in length).  NREL will review all responses, and will select only those it deems qualified to receive the request for proposal.

<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541690 "Other Scientific Technical Consulting Services".  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The proposed study would generate a 2005 air emissions inventory of criteria pollutants- carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter-10 (PM10), particulate matter-2.5 (PM2.5), all VOC including exempted compounds (40CFR51.100), as well as greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), for all sources in the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  This emissions data is needed to support ozone and regional haze modeling efforts promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their more stringent ambient air quality standards for ozone and new regulations for regional haze.  Specific objectives of this study are to provide support services and to recommend any modifications of the Gulfwide Offshore Activities Data System- Version 1 (GOADS-1) and the Database Management Software- Version 1 (DBMS-1), to collect, describe, quality control, and archive 2005 activity data from platform and non-platform sources on the OCS, and to calculate and archive emissions data for calendar year 2005.  Activity data from all equipment sources must be collected from all major platforms on the OCS.  Surveys will have to be performed to gather activity data from non-platform sources, such as support vessels and helicopters.  In addition, estimates shall be made of emissions from commercial shipping, tanker lightering, commercial fisheries, geogenic/biogenic sources, and other emission sources on the OCS.  Scientific personnel must possess extensive expertise in the knowledge of air quality of the Gulf of Mexico region, oil and gas industry, oil production platform equipment, non-platform air emissions sources on the OCS, conducting air emissions inventories, and EPA regulations and submittal procedures.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one and authorship in peer-reviewed scientific publications.  Specific knowledge of Visual Basic Windows and Oracle are needed to support the existing software used to gather platform activity data (GOADS-1) and calculate the total emissions (DBMS-1).  This knowledge should include programming to revise the existing software if necessary, plus understanding the programming languages and software to perform the necessary actions to calculate the high quality emission inventory.  The total performance period of this study is estimated at three (3) years. A description of an on-going emission inventory study sponsored by MMS can be found on the following web page: "Gulfwide Emissions Inventory Study for the Regional Haze and Ozone Modeling Efforts" (GM-99-08) at http://www.gomr.mms.gov/homepg/regulate/environ/ongoing_studies/gom-as.html.  SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting monitoring projects of similar scope and complexity and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 pm Eastern Time on January 9, 2004.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Sharon Teger, Contracting Officer, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2500, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.; or if hand delivered or using a courier service - 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.  Please include with your questions your full name, the RFI number (33205) & title (Year 2005 Gulfwide Emissions Inventory Study), your organization name, complete address, and phone and fax numbers.  PHONE CALLS ARE STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

<DESC>“Sources Sought Synopsis.”  This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition for a Request for Proposal.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package no longer than 5 pages demonstrating ability to provide the hardware listed below.  Include any pertinent information on contracts that have been performed by the company, similar in size and complexity to this effort.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), St. Inigoes, Maryland is seeking potential sources capable of manufacturing Mode 5 (Mark XIIA)-capable Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) equipment that are capable of modifying said equipment to support the planned Mark XIIA Air to Ground Identification Capability (MAAGIC) Advanced Concept/Technology Demonstration (ACTD). With the information gathered from this announcement, the government may solicit competitive proposals for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The hardware required is as follows: (1) Modified XIIA–capable airborne transponder system and (2) Modified XIIA–capable interrogator system.  Neither system will require cryptography-compatibility for this ACTD.  Software changes for both the transponder system and interrogator system will focus on changes in sequence of operations.  This effort is for the equipment and software changes to the equipment to support the proposed ACTD system, and will not require any electric or electronic integration.  A complete concept of system operation will be available.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intend to establish a Clinical Trials Program for the Prevention and Treatment of Infections after Cardiac Surgery, conducting two parallel trials that will focus on prevention and treatment of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections in cardiac surgery patients.  There are a number of new antimicrobial agents with activity against antimicrobial-resistant Gram positive bacteria on the market (Linezolid, Quinupristin/Dalfopristin, etc.). Other investigational drugs such as Lysostaphin show promise as adjunctive therapies or preventive agents.  Use of newer agents may allow earlier discharge of patients or prevention of the spread of multi-drug resistant infections in the ICU environment.  The information obtained from these trials will provide a rational basis for safe and effective therapy for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This will be important because of the increasing resistance to antibiotics. Both trials will also provide scientific insight into the role of bacterial pathogens in the long-term clinical outcome of these type of patients. Furthermore, the results will be evaluated for significant health care cost implications. The trials will address two key questions of therapeutic strategy in the management of cardiac surgery patients: 1) Trial of Sternal Infection Prevention (TOSIP): does a strategy targeting prevention of bacterial infection confer long-term morbidity and mortality benefits in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.   TOSIP will compare three interventions: a) usual care consisting of prophylactic antibiotic; b) nasal decolonizing agent (such as Lysostaphin) in addition to usual care antibiotic; and c) anti-staphylococcal vaccine in addition to usual care antibiotic.  It is anticipated that 6,189 patients will be recruited.  This trial will also provide scientific insights into the role of bacterial suppression in the long-term clinical outcome and the cost and quality of life implications associated with the proposed strategies.  2) The Treatment of Major Infection Trial (TOMIT): does a novel strategy employing immunotherapy and targeted to alleviate infection, confer long-term morbidity and mortality benefits beyond usual anti-bacterial therapy for those patients who have a major wound infection requiring two days or more of antibiotic treatment with 30 days of intervention.  TOMIT will compare two interventions: a) usual care with antibiotic; and b) antibody-based immunotherapeutic agent (such as hyperimmune globulin or humanized monoclonal antibody) in addition to antibiotic.  The trial will also provide scientific insights into the role of immunotherapy in the long-term clinical outcome of patients with postoperative sternal wound infections requiring systemic antibiotics and the cost and quality of life implications associated with the proposed strategies.  It is anticipated that 1,244 patients will be recruited. The program will be composed of a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) with over 100 participating clinical sites, and a Core Microbiology Laboratory (CML).  The NHLBI intends to release separate Requests for Proposals (RFP’s) for the DCC, CCC & CML. The CCC will select, manage and coordinate the efforts of the clinical sites, including reimbursement for their protocol stipulated activities, and assure best clinical practices.   The DCC will coordinate all aspects of the research and manage and analyze the patient and research data.  The CML will be responsible for coordinating the collection of Staphylococcal isolates and clinical specimens from clinical sites, developing standard operating procedures for handling, verification, characterization and distribution of specimens to internal and external investigators. The DCC, CCC & CML and a representative of the NHLBI will form a Steering Committee that serves as the governing body of the program. The CCC will participate in the preparation and finalization of the protocol, including the design of study, selection of treatment strategies and endpoints, and definition of adverse events. The CCC will be responsible for the selection and management of clinical sites and ensuring high clinical performance of the sites.  The CCC will monitor and ensure that adequate number of patients is enrolled into each trial. The CCC in collaboration with the DCC will arrange and conduct site visits to the clinical sites. The CCC will collaborate with DCC in preparing confidential reports and analyses for NHLBI review committees including a Protocol Review Committee (PRC) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  This announcement is a market survey to assess the availability and technical capability of small businesses as defined the NAICS code 541710 for research and development in the physical, engineering and life sciences.  The appropriate size standard is 500 employees.  Small business firms having demonstrated experience in meeting the requirements described above are invited to submit capability statements in original and two copies.  Capability statements must provide evidence of 1) the availability of professional staff qualified in recruitment and management of clinics taking part in clinical trials, 2) the experience of the organization to manage a program of this  scope, 3) facilities for performance of the requirements listed above, 4) the CCC personnel should be knowledgeable and experienced in the conduct of clinical trials in critically ill patients, and 5) the organization’s status as a small business under NAICS 541710.  Capability statements in response to this sources sought synopsis that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is not a request for proposals and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is anticipated on or about March 31, 2004. The Government intends to award one contract for a period of 5 years, on or about April 30, 2005.  Firms responding to this market survey must provide pertinent information to the requirements described above by January 9, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to support a repository for the National Children’s Study.  The support services being sought are related to the establishment and operation of a large repository to receive, store, and aliquot biological, medical, and environmental samples that will be collected throughout the study (as described below).  It is anticipated that the repository will distribute samples to investigators at the direction of the Government.  It is also desirable to include storage of data from sample analyses and completed data collection forms in an integrated repository system.  NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities and limitations of organizations interested in providing one or more of the services described below.  Given the broad scope of materials being considered for this repository, NICHD may consider both single company/single site or integrated multi-company/multi-site offerors.

BACKGROUND:

The Children’s Health Act of 2000 authorized the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and a consortium of other Federal Agencies to “…plan, develop, and implement a prospective cohort study, from birth to adulthood, to …incorporate behavioral, emotional, educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial environmental influences of children’s well-being.  That Study is now known as the National Children’s Study (NCS).  Investigators in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), including NICHD, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as at other Federal agencies, have begun to plan and implement this study.

The NCS will study the complex relationship between health and the environment for approximately 100,000 U.S. children and their families.  Enrollment of subjects will begin before birth (and possibly before conception) and follow-up will continue at least until each child is 21 years of age.  Study planners have identified the following child health areas as priorities for the NCS:  pregnancy outcomes, neurodevelopment and behavior, injury, asthma, obesity and physical development.

As a result of the many study hypotheses being considered for the NCS, as well as the anticipation that other hypotheses will emerge during the course of the Study and afterward, a very significant number of diverse specimens (2 to 20 billion) will be collected over the life of the project.  Specimens will include a wide variety of biological and environmental samples.  Biological specimens may include, but are not limited to, blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva, stool, semen, buccal cells, breast milk, amniotic fluid, colostrom, placentas, cord blood, meconium, nasal swipes, teeth, autopsy tissues and slides.  Environmental samples may include, but are not limited to, duplicate diets, dryer lint, household dust (vacuum and wipes) mattress dust, water, allergens, pesticides, handwipes, soil, air samples, mold/mildew, toys, carpets, and floor mats.

Because Study planning is still underway, plans for a repository for the study are still evolving.  Concepts that are being discussed include shipping all samples from a sampling technician to a central receiving repository where they will be processed and aliquoted, and then sending aliquots to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories. Alternatively, most or all samples may be shipped first to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories where they will be aliquotted, with remaining material sent to the main repository.  Discussions also relate to having regional sub-repositories for dynamic handling and storage with a central repository for long-term storage.  In all cases, having a second repository to handle some fraction of material for disaster mitigation is being discussed.  Given the long-term nature of the study, the repository will need to have the capability for testing to ensure the long-term integrity and viability of the stored samples.  It must also have the capability for testing outside investigator-suggested analytic procedures for compatibility with the storage conditions of the NCS samples, to ensure that the valuable stored samples are not wasted.  Included in this concept is developing or verifying thawing procedures, etc., as necessary, removing the samples from the repository and getting them to outside investigators in an appropriate condition/form.

EXPECTATIONS OF A FUTURE CONTRACTOR:  A service contract is anticipated to be used as the National Children=s Study Sample Repository, which shall be located in a dedicated facility(ies) owned or operated by the contractor for the specific purpose of this contract.  The successful contractor shall possess the following qualifications, or meet the following requirements at the time of proposal submission:  

1) Have extensive experience managing large biological and/or environmental sample repositories;
2) Have the capability to rapidly develop the capacity to process and store a large number of samples.  [The estimated maximum number of samples is 2 - 20 billion over the 20+ years life of the study, with the heaviest sample load being during the early years of the study.]
3) Have experience in archiving environmental samples, such as:
·	soil samples, filters, bags, molds, sediments, ampulated extracts,
·	special samples such as carpet sections, floor mats, toys, food;
	4) Have experience in archiving biological samples, such as:
·	Blood, urine, hair, nails, teeth, buccal cells, breast milk, meconium, cord blood, umbilical cords, autopsy samples, tissues such as placentas;
	5) Have experience in archiving documents and/or other materials, such as: 
·	Questionnaires, paper records, electronic images/pictures, 3D ultrasounds, X-rays;
	6) Have the ability to aliquot and do general laboratory analyses on the various types of samples;
	7) Have the capability to handle unfrozen, frozen, and liquid nitrogen frozen samples (e.g. –20°C, -70°C, -80°C);
	8 Have the capability to handle raw samples and extracted samples;
	9) Possess, or show evidence of, the ability to develop, a computerized sample tracking system;
	10) Have the capability to handle emergency situations, such as problems with:
·	Control of room temperature and humidity
·	Control and backup of freezer conditions
·	Hardware and software failures of computer systems;
	11) Have the ability to provide the appropriate climate controlled space for the repository needs over the life of the Study.  This is to include sample receiving and shipping facilities, sample storage facilities, laboratory facilities and office and computer space. The total required space is not needed initially, however the facility must be expandable to the total estimated capacity;
	12) Have personnel with the demonstrated ability to manage a large long-term project like the NCS repository.  This includes personnel with expertise in the handling, storage, and analysis of the sample types as indicated in items #4 and #5 above.  Expertise in computerized data management is also required.

<RESPDATE>020304
<ARCHDATE>04032004
<CONTACT>David Culp, 410-278-5033
<DESC>Qualified, interested sources sought for R&D Project entitled, Joint Manned-Unmanned System Team Concept.  The successes of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in recent conflicts and the rapidly developing capabilities they provide have led to the devel opment of a large number of UAVs and initiation of additional UAV programs within the Services and by our historic coalition partners.  Significant numbers and varying types of UAVs may be deployed in areas that also contain manned aircraft.  Lessons learn ed from these conflicts indicate that air power supported by ground observers becomes much more effective.   This mandates the ability to integrate and coordinate UAVs with Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and manned assets.  Integrated Command and Control (ICC) of all these assets is apparently needed.  The critical operational need is to provide the capability to manage and apply multiple assets, manned and unmanned, ground and air, in a combat environment when a common UAV/UGV manned architecture does not  exist or is not completely implemented.  It includes separation of manned systems from unmanned systems, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) issues (particularly as it pertains to use of lethal unmanned systems), relay of critical information, and general Command and Control issues.  The proposed concept is to integrate existing components to develop a mobile ICC suite that will be capable of controlling and/or coordinating the activities of a large numbers of varying assets:  ground and air; manned and unm anned.  This suite will be interoperable with similar suites to provide asset hand-offs.  This will not be based on a common architecture, but will instead be based on direct control when feasible; communication with the operator; or other appropriate meas ures when neither of the previously mentioned possibilities is feasible.  These other tactics may include jamming, destruction of the asset, or rerouting of controlled assets around the problematic asset.  Computer-assisted visualization of the environment  will be required, with the ability to project paths and possible solutions.  Control translators will be provided to allow the Controllers/Pilot to provide direct control to various assets without having to learn multiple control schemes or inputs.  Prima ry new technologies to be demonstrated include:  Software to provide Common Regional Operating Picture (CROP); software control translators; collaborative tools; communications and ADP equipment integration in a mobile capability; 3-D visualization tools; UGVs; UAVs; and mission planning and execution integration.  An important design parameter will be the capability to readily add new platforms to the ICC suite as they are developed and fielded.  The Government is considering the initiation of a project to  explore alternatives and to develop an  ICC suite or other appropriate integrated system.  Contractors interested in the requirement shall provide a brief description of their capabilities to perform this study and their relevant experience, not to exceed  three typed pages, as an MS Word attachment to an email addressed to david.culp@us.army.mil.  Include the Government contract number, nomenclature, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and his or her phone number if the company gained the experience u nder a Government contract.  There is presently no firm requirement for this study.  The contracting office does not have funding for this potential action, and there is not an available solicitation or statement of work.  We do not have any definite infor mation regarding plans to issue a solicitation or award a contract, and do not know if or when the statement of work or solicitation will be available.  Also, we will not provide potential contractors with the identity of the requiring activity or technica l point of contact at this time.  Please direct questions to David Culp, Contract Specialist at 410-278-5033 or at the email address above.

A. INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Force Protection Battlelab (AFFPB) mission is to identify innovative concepts for protecting Air Force personnel, facilities and weapon systems; rapidly measure the potential for advancing Air Force core competencies; and to explore joint warfighting by using field ingenuity, modeling, simulation, and actual employment of exploratory capabilities in operational environments.  The AFFPB invites solution based quad charts with rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates that address Air Force Force Protection mission needs in the following areas:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection. This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals. Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.” A secure website has been established to provide public access to the BAA package, collect unclassified submittals, and track classified submittals. All submitters responding to this BAA are required to register at the secure BAA Information Delivery System (BIDS) website https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. Click on “register” under the “account center” heading. The submitter must complete all mandatory fields on the BIDS submitter registration form.

(1) Technical Description: This BAA solicits innovative quad charts addressing solutions to identified Air Force Force Protection needs. The Force Protection Battlelab has divided its focus into three distinct areas: force health protection, counterterrorism/antiterrorism, and force protection.  This broad agency announcement is only looking for concepts that fall within these three areas.  Submit quad charts that address:  Force Protection, Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism, and Force Health Protection Force.  
Subgroup Description	Subgroup/Requirement Designator
Force Health Protection 	FHP-100
Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism	CTAT-200
Force Protection 	FP-300

a.  Force Health Protection (FHP-100) - Force Health Protection is defined as all services performed, provided, or arranged by the Services to promote, improve, conserve, or restore the physical well-being of personnel.  The Force Health Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Preventive and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded, injured or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit
§	Blood management and immunization methodologies
§	Field expedient first aid, hemorrhage control, emergency wound treatment, management of fractures and treatment of burns
§	Processes to address injuries resulting from nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological and conventional weapons
§	Personnel training, insertion of capability at the point of need, interoperability with other service and civilian assets
§	Medical surveillance of non-battle injuries and illnesses, endemic infectious diseases and exposure to nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons or materials.
§	Methods for decontamination of personnel and equipment
§	Medical first responder communications and reachback/reachforward capabilities.  
Specific areas of interest in the area of Force Health Protection can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb. 

b.  Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism (CTAT-200) - Counterterrorism is defined as offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism.  Antiterrorism is defined as defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military forces.  While this area of interest applies to military it also focuses on solution sets that would apply to homeland security and homeland defense.  The Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism subgroup focuses on identifying concepts to improve:
§	Security of personnel, assets and facilities
§	Prevention of unauthorized access to equipment, installations, and material
§	Vulnerability assessments; command and control; training and equipment for first responders; personnel and vehicle access control; biometric identification devices
§	Law enforcement operations
§	Intelligence operations as they apply to terrorist threats.  This includes the collection, analysis, and dissemination of all forms of available intelligence.
Specific areas of interest in the area of Counterterrorism/Antiterrorism can be viewed in the Other Downloads section at https://bids.acqcenter.com/affpb.
c.  Force Protection (FP-300) - Force Protection is defined as actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.  These actions conserve the force's fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.  The Force Protection subgroup focuses on concepts to improve:
§	Methods or tools to improve emergency response operations  
§	Methods or tools to improve explosive ordnance disposal operations, to include locating, reconnoitering, accessing, identifying, rendering safe, removing, and disposing of large and small quantities of unexploded ordnance 
§	Ability of personnel to operate in a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) environment 
§	Methods or tools to increase the resistance of buildings, shelters, and areas to terrorist attacks
§	Methods or tools to improve the physical security of installations worldwide
§	Methods for the NBC agent detection, identification, and warning

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for proposal and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.              


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Infectious Disease (NCID), Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases (DBMD) through its component Branches has lead technical responsibility for a number of Category A, B and C bioterrorism agents and their associated toxins (Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium botulinum, Brucella sps., Burkholderia sps., Staphylococcus entertoxin B, other food- or waterborne bacterial pathogens, and other bacterial agents).   DBMD uses epidemiologic, laboratory, clinical, and biostatistical sciences to control and prevent bacterial and mycotic infectious disease.   The Division also conducts applied research in a variety of settings, and translates the findings of this research into public health practice.                
 

DBMD is seeking to evaluate commercial products, or products in development, for in vitro comparison of immunotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic antibody treatments for anthrax. Specifically these may include monoclonal and polyclonal antibody toxin inhibitors and inhibitors of intracellular anthrax toxin function.  CDC will coordinate the evaluation of products in a range of in vitro and in vivo models.  Data obtained from this comparative analysis will be used by CDC and DHHS in making recommendations and decisions on development of an appropriate procurement strategy to meet the Nation’s bioterrorism defense needs.                


Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit documentation for CDC to assess whether the offered product(s) are at a sufficient stage of development to be included in this comparative analysis.  As a minimum, submitted information should be sufficient for CDC to assess the following for each candidate product:     
a.	Pre-clinical animal efficacy studies.       
b.	Pre-clinical pharmacokinetic studies.       
c.	Biochemical analysis to include;     
Binding affinity measurements for monoclonal antibodies.
Animal species (if applicable).
Epitope or domain binding targets (if available).
Mass value assignment for antigen-specific antibody levels (e.g. Anti-PA specific IgG concentration).                


Organizations that have products selected by CDC for this comparative analysis will be required to submit data packages with as much detail as possible for the pre-clinical studies, and to enter into an appropriate agreement prior to the transfer of any material to CDC.  Sample agreements may be viewed at the following web site:  http://www.cdc.gov/od/ads/techtran/forms.htm
All information submitted to CDC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905).

<SUBJECT>A -- Data Coordinating Center for the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN)
<DESC>The Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate for a multiple-year contract with Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), Unique Capabilities.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competitive unfeasible for this requirement.  PPD has provided statistical, data management, and safety monitoring support for the DAIT’s Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) under a subcontracting agreement with the EMMES Corporation under contract number N01-AI-95382.  The proposed contract will permit PPD to continue providing statistical, data management and safety monitoring support for the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  Interruption of these activities will lead to complete paralysis of clinical data collection and processing, analysis of results, development of further scientific concepts and publication. Therefore, DAIT has determined PPD is the only source to satisfy agency requirements to avoid unacceptable delays in developing and initiating new immune tolerance studies.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and must respond by submitting the information on/before the closing date noted in this announcement.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort.  See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

6.  Terms/Conditions/Attachments added, deleted, or modified:

ADD: SPECIAL REQUIREMENT.  


ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall result in a corresponding increase in the time afforded to Charterer to accept delivery of the Vessel.

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD: FORCE PROTECTION.  

(1) Owner agrees that U. S. Armed Forces personnel may board the Vessel at any time at any location for U. S. national security purposes, gives consent for such boarding, and agrees to cooperate fully with such U.S. Armed Forces personnel in the boarding party.  Owner also agrees to permit U. S. Armed Forces personnel to search without limitation any and all vessel spaces for U.S. national security purposes.

(2) Owner agrees to render all necessary assistance to U. S. Armed Forces personnel with respect to the identification and screening of crew members or such others as may be aboard the Vessel.  Owner consents to the immediate removal of crewmembers or such others as may be aboard the Vessel deemed unsuitable for any reason by the Contracting Officer or U.S. Armed Forces personnel.  Owner agrees to replace any such crewmembers promptly and that such replacements will fully comply with all crew screening requirements.  Charterer agrees to bear proven and reasonable costs incurred by Owner associated with replacement, if necessary.

(3) Charterer reserves the right, at Charterer’s sole option, to embark U.S. Armed Forces personnel and their weapons at any time during the period of the Charter to protect U. S. Armed Forces personnel, cargo or equipment on board the Vessel.  These force protection personnel will provide security in accordance with rules of engagement established by competent U. S. military authorities and will operate under the command of such authorities.  Charterer agrees to reimburse Owner for cost of such personnel at the rate set forth in the Charter for Supercargo.

(4) Owner agrees to comply fully with the current ship threat condition measures required by relevant Navy and MSC Force Protection instructions and messages for the threat condition of the area.  See paragraph IV(ae) for additional requirements, although the requirements of COMSC instruction 5530.3 shall apply only to time charters of six months or longer.   

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.  The MSCHQ Command Center should be contacted if the Area Command cannot be reached.  Contact numbers will be provided upon award.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: IMMUNIZATIONS. (U.S.-flag only)

(1)  U.S. flag time chartered vessel services are considered essential contractor services to the Department of Defense in support of military and associated support missions.  As a result, Masters, officers, crewmembers, and other individuals who are embarked on such vessels for Owner’s purposes, including but not limited to subcontractors, are considered contractor personnel performing mission essential services under DODI 3020.37, November 6, 1990, (Change 1, January 26, 1996), and are subject to the following:

    a.  Masters, officers, crewmembers and other individuals, as described above, who are embarked on any vessel subject to this charter must be medically pre-screened and immunized in accordance with Commander, Military Sealift Command (COMSC) policy, and any changes thereto, in effect or made during the period of this charter, including any options or extensions.  Owner shall ensure that all Masters, Officers, crewmembers, and other individuals embarked on any vessel subject to this charter comply with all such immunization programs.  Notification of immunization requirements pursuant to this section shall be provided to Owner by the Contracting Officer.

    b.  When immunizations are required pursuant to this clause, Owner must provide notification, as directed by the Contracting Officer, of the immunization status of all embarked personnel within 24 hours of fixture or award.  Further, at any time during the contract period, the immunization status of any relief personnel scheduled to board the vessel is required no later than 96 hours prior to the personnel change, unless authorized otherwise by the Contracting Officer.

    c.  Any Master, officer, crewmember or other individual who refuses to comply with the immunization requirements, or who is ineligible for a particular required immunization as provided herein, shall be removed by Owner from the vessel as soon as possible, but not later than the next port call unless authorized by the Contracting Officer, and replaced with personnel who either have the required immunization or are eligible and will comply with the policy.  Any removal and replacement of personnel pursuant to this clause shall be solely at Owner’s expense, including, but not limited to, travel, per diem, wages and associated administrative expenses.

    d.  Crew shortages resulting from the application of this section may subject the vessel to being placed off-hire.
