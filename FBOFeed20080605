<CONTACT>Patrica Richmond, Email patricia.richmond@usafa.af.mil
<DESC>Intent to Award Brand Name Diego Powered Dissector and Drill System   

10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06. The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423450 and the size standard is 500 employees. The requirement is to purchase: 2 each Product number 70339001 Diego Handpiece, 1 each part number 7035-3001 Somnus Machine (G3) and 1 each shipping and handling.  These items will require identification adhering to DFARS 252.211-7003 (http://farsite.hill.af.mil).  The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:

a. Currently, the OR Department and ENT clinic have a problem of double booking cases because the two Departments have to use the same equipment.  The purchase of this equipment will eliminate this problem.  However, the two areas will still be able to share equipment.  Therefore, the equipment must be the same so it can be interchangeable and be utilized by both the OR and clinic.  The OR also needs to increase the number of Diego Shaver Hand pieces to support the increased caseload after the hospital transitions to a Surgery Center.   

b.  The ENT surgeons use various Gyrus products on a weekly basis for most of their surgical procedures.  Certain minor procedures utilizing Gyrus products are also used in the ENT clinic.  All equipment must be interchangeable with existing pieces.  Our surgical technicians, nurses, and ENT doctors have been trained on and are proficient with the Gyrus Somnus Machine and Diego Hand pieces.  In addition, skills are maintained by yearly training that is provided by Gyrus.  If any other equipment were purchased there would be an unacceptable learning curve required to become proficient to a level that would not jeopardize a patients safety.  If other brand hand pieces and machines were purchased, new compatible equipment would also have to be purchased.  This would be a duplicated cost, plus would render the Gyrus equipment useless.    

Technical Data:     

The Gyrus G3 System Generator has two principal
modes of operation:

- The monopolar mode has controls for maximum
temperature and energy delivered. The unit has
readouts for total energy delivered, impedance,
temperature for two thermocouples and time of
energy delivery.

- The bipolar mode has controls for output waveform
type and power. The unit has readouts for set power
and waveform.
Connectors on the front panel include the monopolar
connector for active electrode and dispersive electrode
and separate dual bipolar connectors for PlasmaCision
electrodes and bipolar instruments. The foot pedal is
connected on the back panel.
Accessories included with the generator are the
electrodes, connector cable, footswitch and a power
cable.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the procurement of the Nose Gear Extension Thrusterand the Pressure Cartridge.  The Space Shuttle Orbiter uses the Thruster and PressureCartridges each flight to ensure that the Nose Landing Gear is down and in the lockedposition prior to landing.  The Thruster is classified as Critical 1/1 for failure tofunction, and the Pressure Cartridge Critical 1/1 for inadvertent operation and Critical1/R2 for low pressure output.  As such, the hardware must be manufactured by arecognized, qualified source.NASA/JSC intends to purchase these 15 Thrusters and 40 Pressure Cartridges from AircraftInterior Products, Goodrich Corporation, in Fairfield, California through a  firmed fixedprice contract. The proposed period of performance is for July 1, 2008, through September30, 2009. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as contemplated by the provisions of FAR 6.302-1. This provisionstates that full and open competition need not be provided for when the services requiredby the agency are available from only the original source in the case of a follow-oncontract for the continued development or production of a major system or highlyspecialized equipment. The provision also states that this exception is applicable whenit is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication ofcost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or therewould be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agencys requirements.Currently the only available source qualified to produce flight certified Thrusters andPressure Cartridges per the NASA specification SKD26100100 (Design and PerformanceSpecification for Orbiter Nose Gear Extension Thruster and Pressure Cartridge) isAircraft Interior Products, Goodrich Corporation. The Thrusters and Pressure Cartridgeswere qualified for Human Spaceflight almost 30 years ago and have only been procured afew times. Aircraft Interior Products, Goodrich Corporation possesses the specialtooling, processes and procedures, necessary to produce and deliver units that meet thedemanding requirements of this hardware. These Thrusters and Pressure Cartridges are notproduced on a regular basis.  Enough units shall be purchased in this procurement tocover the current estimated flight-life of the Orbiters. The cost and schedule impactsrelated to qualifying another source to manufacture this hardware would be prohibitiveand not in the best interest of the Government.  Also, these Thrusters and PressureCartridges are not produced on a regular basis and enough units shall be purchased inthis procurement to cover the current estimated flight-life of the Orbiters.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local timeon June 20, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC> By way of this Notice and in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, the Chicago District, US Army Corps of Engineers, announces its intentions to award a sole source contract to Renewable Resources of 265 Dean Road, Barnesville, Georgia.  Services to be acquired pertain to the mitigation of wetlands in T36N; R8W; S19, which is located between Clark Road and Chase Street in the city of Gary, Lake County, Indiana. This work will constitute fulfillment of mitigation requirements for the Cady Marsh Ditch deep tunnel project at Arbogast Street in Griffith, Indiana.  UNDER THE CONTRACT SET, the Contractor will responsible for providing all necessary labor, equipment, facilities and materials to perform the following work:  PHASE I WORK: Restore 2 acres of native wet savanna, including the clearing, herbiciding and removal of invasive woody and herbaceous plant material and the seeding and planting of native species; and  PHASE II WORK: Monitor and Maintain the 2-acre wet savanna planting for a period of 5 years from the date of contract award.  To its credit, Renewable Resources has a broad knowledge base in the area of wetland mitigation. As the original service provider to the Chicago District-USACE, Renewable Resources performed mitigation work at the 2-acre Cady Marsh Ditch (CMD) mitigation site.  The site is isolated and has no access except directly through the adjacent 89-acre Little Calumet River mitigation project, which is currently being implemented and maintained by Renewable Resources and nearing completion (Plate 1). Renewable Resources has demonstrated that they have the capability and expertise to clear, BY HAND, areas that are extensively overgrown by invasive trees and shrubs. The light equipment necessary to undertake such hand clearing (chain saws, loppers, back pack herbicide sprayers) can be carried through the existing mitigation area on foot without harm to the plantings. Mechanical clearing, on the other hand, is not feasible here. It would be impossible to reach the CMD mitigation site with the heavy equipment (tractors, Timber Ax or other type of tree mower/chipper etc.) that typical native plant community restorationists use without causing significant damage to the native wet prairie already established. Award of the CMD mitigation contract to Renewable Resources is in the Government’s best interest because the firm is uniquely qualified to perform the highly complex mitigation work made necessary by unique site conditions. These unique qualifications are demonstrated by their adjacent 89-acre Little Calumet River mitigation work as well as their many years of wetland ecology experience. Awarding this work to a firm that does not hold these unique qualifications would cost the tax payers large sums of money by significantly reducing the likelihood that the CMD mitigation project could be successfully implemented and, furthermore, by jeopardizing the already-established Little Calumet River mitigation project.


The period of performance is for approximately 5 years.  It is anticipated that the resultant contact will be a firm-fixed price service contract (the proposed contract will also include a liquidated damages clause and the requirement for a performance bond).  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers, proposals, etc.  However, interested firms may send a capabilities statement, including the following information: 1) A brief description of the education and experience of the Project Manager, the Site Supervisor and field staff; 2)  A brief description of three (3) natural area restorations, including a discussion of the type of project, size of the project in acres and cost, completed by the interested firm;  3)  A brief description of three (3) natural area restorations, including a discussion of the type of project, size of the project in acres and cost, currently being carried out by the interested firm, and  4) A brief discussion of the firm’s natural area assessment abilities.  STATEMENTS/RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JUNE 23, 2008.  Statements should be sent to the attention of Regina G. Blair at regina.g.blair@usace.army.mil; ENSURE THAT THE SUBJECT LINE OF YOUR EMAIL INCLUDES THE TITLE/DESCRIPTION OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Award is anticipated on or about August 15, 2008. This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  The point of contact is Regina Blair at (312) 846-5371.

The US Army Project Manager for PM Command Posts (formerly Tactical Radio Communication Systems) is conducting market research to identify potential qualified vendors capable of providing technical services and support of U.S. Army Mission Critical Communication Equipment and Systems Acquisition Management Support.  

An anticipated contract will be a 5 year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vehicle that provides engineering and technical services in support of U.S. Army mission-critical communication equipment and systems.  Services include: system engineering, software engineering, logistics support, fielding support and training support, as well as unique depot repair and test bed capabilities required to support mission-critical communication equipment and systems.  

The equipment delineated further below are all part of the Mission Critical Defense System (MCDS).  These equipments are used by the Joint Services, primarily the Army. The hardware/software designs and configurations for these systems are technically complex and dynamic due to the rapidly changing military communications environment.  Remote Training and other applicable peripheral/interface devices and equipment will be included for all future upgrades.  Requirements are specified for the physical establishment, utilization, management, control inclusive of a contractor maintenance support of a Test Facility for these systems at a contractor designated location.  Government objectives and requirements are for the establishment and performance by the contractor of necessary program management and control (cost, task execution and schedule factors), for the performance of software quality assurance management and for the configuration management functions of the MCDS equipments.  The Government does not own the data rights and therefore can not organically support these MCDS systems at this time. 

The supported MCDS systems and equipment include, but are not limited to High Mobility DGM (Digital Group Multiplexer) Assemblages (HMDA) / HS(High Speed) HMDA,  AN/TTC/TYC-39 Switch, AN/TTC-56 Single Shelter Switch (SSS) and MSE Family of Switches, Compact Digital Switch (CDS), Switch Multiplexer Unit (SMU), Line Termination Unit (LTU), Vantage, Single Row Nest (SRN) switch components, and derivative variants such as Baseband Node (BBN), Network Operations Center Vehicle (NOCV) and  Tactical High Speed Data Network (THSDN)).  This equipment operates Mobile Subscriber Equipment and its derivative systems (communications networks) which are crucial to Army global communications.  

Key technical and program management criteria are established based on the primary capability requirement of potential contractors to perform the technical efforts identified in the Government’s draft Statement of Work (SOW).  Criteria elements that will be utilized in an evaluation are Program Management, System Engineering, Logistics Support, Software Engineering, Training Devices Upgrade, Fielding Support, Depot Support and Testing Support.  

An anticipated 5 year IDIQ contract Period of Performance is projected to be on or about 27 August 2008 for a three-year base period between 28 August 2008 – 27 August 2011 and two additional one-year options for continued services.  The POP will facilitate continued coverage of essential technical support for mission-critical communications equipment used by the Army, as well as the Joint Services.   Tasks may be placed under this IDIQ contract as needed on a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) or Time and Materials (T&M) basis. 

Any and each potential contractor response to the FedBizOps sources sought announcement will be reviewed to assess the extent to which the contractor’s current technical and management capabilities, as well as past performance, would enable the contractor to perform the key program management and technical tasks identified by the criteria elements indicated above.  Possible subcontracting opportunities to a prime vendor are unknown at this time.

Any interest should be conveyed with a title page containing the vendor name, date, and the name and telephone number of the author and/or other points of contact. A description should provide evidence of vendor experience and briefly summarize the capabilities to support above cited systems.  A description should also reflect the vendor's previous demonstrated performance in managing and supporting similar systems comparable in size and complexity. Vendors must provide all such information in writing.  
Questions and/or comments regarding this notice and SOW may be submitted via e-mail to charles.ade@gsa.gov or charm.yeung@gsa.gov.  Verbal questions and/or comments will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Indian Health Services (IHS) is performing market research to identify sources capable of assisting the IHS Head Start Program with 1) Planning and facilitating meetings, cluster training and teleconference training; 2) Coordinating and identifying speakers and consultants for specific program activities and audiences and for workshops; and 3) Disseminating health information for national and tribal programs. The estimated performance period for this project would be approximately September 25, 2008 through September 24, 2009, with 3 additional option years.  

The purpose of this project is to provide support for building the capacity of Indian Head Start grantees in maintaining an infrastructure for providing Head Start health services for approximately 23,000 infants, toddlers and pre-school Indian children. The Head Start Program Performance Standards serve as the foundation for effecting quality health services and establishing partnerships and linkages with health providers within local Tribal communities administering Head Start services. The delivery of quality Head Start Health Services requires local partnerships and effective management of Head Start Health services.  The 154 Tribal governments and consortia administrating Head Start programs along with their Head Start directors and managers of health, mental health and disabilities services must have access to accurate, timely information and resources on the health concerns of infants and toddlers and preschool Indian children within their communities, as well as Head Start employees.  Head Start program employees must have an opportunity to build their knowledge and skills in order to work with Head Start children, families and community service providers.  Employees working with young children must meet staff safety requirements in addition to maintaining their own health and mental health. Creative efforts will be implemented to provide cost effective delivery of resources, information and training so that Head Start programs can access IHS Head Start services inexpensively.  Based upon the needs of Indian Head Start programs, the project will use a variety of approaches and methods for delivering the services required within the scope of this project.  The project will disseminate resources and information through the use of electronic communication, autographic teleconferencing and web based conferencing, web page knowledge dissemination, convening and participating in workgroups, planning and facilitating cluster training events.  Targeted areas of health issues and related health topics addressed by the vendor may include: mental health, oral health, childhood obesity, health and safety, substance abuse, institutionalizing and integrating staff wellness as a human resource service, and personnel management in meeting employee background screening and checks.
____________________________________________________________________________
Tasks:

Task 1:  Plan and facilitate meetings, cluster trainings and teleconference trainings.
The vendor will communicate with Head Start program directors and program managers for determining cluster training ideas, e.g., topics, location, and methods of delivery of cluster training programs.  This information will be used to plan cluster training programs either localized to the greatest number of Head Start programs or by autographic and web based conferencing training programs and Indian Head Start regional or national conferences.  The vendor will work closely with the IHS Head Start Director and will not implement the training program until approval is received on announcements, consultant trainers, method of delivery, etc.  All programs will be identified as an IHS Head Start function and meet the dissemination requirements of IHS.  The vendor will plan and facilitate 4 cluster training programs throughout the12 month period.  As an example, training programs will be implemented covering the topics of oral health and mental health.

Vendor will plan and arrange for autographic teleconference training programs.  The vendor will provide the necessary networking systems, bridges and lines for the programs.  Topics for the autographic training programs will be IHS Head Start Program driven or may be selected by the IHS Head Start Program as topics of the greatest need based upon growing health concerns or programmatic issues experienced by Head Start programs.  The programs can be single focused covering only one topic or can be arranged so that multiple topics are offered focusing on specific geographic areas within IHS Service Areas.  Four (4) teleconference programs are planned.  Each training program will be scheduled for 90 minutes with the project arranging for a sufficient number of lines for grantee call in, dissemination of announcements, agendas and training support materials.  The vendor will provide the conference bridge and grantees would be responsible for paying the cost for their telephone calls. Vendor will facilitate at least two workgroup meetings, to include facilitation and logistical support.

Task 2:  Identify speakers and consultants for specific topics and audiences.
The IHS Head Start Program, in carrying out its charges, taps numerous health experts for workgroup activities, cluster trainings, conference workshops, teleconference programs and resource material development.  Vendor will maintain a directory of expert consultants to be used by the project and the IHS Head Start Program.  All consultants contained in the directory will have the approval of the Director of the IHS Head Start Program.  Consultants will be deployed by the project as guided by the Director of the IHS Head Start Program. It is anticipated there will be circumstances that will necessitate the use of health consultants that may not be included in the directory. Workshops may include health workshops for the Southwest Consortium of Indian Head Start Programs, Inc., National Indian Head Start Directors Association, Northwest Indian Head Start Coalition and other groups associated with Indian early childhood development programming. 

Task 3:  Share and disseminate IHS Head Start and Tribal Head Start program information and serve as a clearinghouse in disseminating information from IHS Head Start Program to national and Tribal programs.

The IHS Head Start Program provides guidance, support and directives on infant, toddler and preschool children’s preventative health concerns.  IHS’s principal target audiences are Head Start and Early Head Start programs operated by Tribal governments in 27 states scattered throughout the nation.  Electronic communication methods are the most cost effective approach in communicating with the Indian Head Start and Early Head Start programs.  The key Head Start employees that could be provided information are directors and health services mangers, but other Head Start employees often have a need for health information.  All of the Indian Head Start programs have access to the World Wide Web and email services.  Managing a listserv of the 154 programs requires constant diligence in maintaining correct email addresses due to the high attrition rate of Head Start directors and program managers.  Direct communication with Head Start employees can be effective and can be augmented and supported by the IHS Head Start Program’s web page.  Guidance and directives disseminated via a listserv to Head Start programs can then be posted to the IHS web page and easily downloaded by programs, other groups and early childhood providers.

Vendor will maintain an email directory of Head Start directors and health services managers.  This email group will be used to distribute the IHS Head Start Program’s training announcements, information and resource guidance, as examples, seeking information on the health issues and concerns which challenge local Head Start employees in carrying out their responsibilities. Vendor will, on a quarterly basis, seek the advice and assistance from local programs. Reports will be developed from the information gleaned from the local programs and submitted to the Director of the IHS Head Start Program.   Prior to seeking input from local programs, project staff will collaborate with the IHS Program staff for determining the types of information sought from the local programs.  Concurrence will be required prior to seeking any information from local programs. From time to time, vendor will work with other IHS contractors as directed by the IHS Head Start Program Director to assist with the local program input into service delivery.

The newly developing IHS Head Start Program’s web page will serve as a valuable source of health and mental health information and resources for working with infants, toddlers and pre-school children.  The information posted on the web page will be available to the general public, IHS health providers as well as Head Start programs.  Additionally, IHS has mechanisms for direct mailings to local programs that provide hard copies of resource materials developed by IHS contractors and staff.  An organized system for using available methods of distributing information is required. 

Vendor will establish a system for the timely distribution of resource materials to Head Start and Early Head Start programs that will link with the IHS Head Start Program’s web page and the established email directory of local program staff. Vendor will provide support for IHS Health specialists and consultants for researching and writing 10 health specific bulletins.  Topics may include: staff wellness; employee background checks; childhood communicable diseases; child nutrition; oral health; early prevention; home and program environmental safety, as examples.  The bulletins will be emailed and posted on the IHS web page following the appropriate IHS procedures.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY OF INTERESTED CONTRACTORS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR QUOTATION OR PROPOSAL.
The purpose of this sources sought is to determine the availability of interested contractors to provide consultation services to the National Park Service Concession Management Program on the appropriate types of insurance and amount of coverage the NPS should require in various concession contracts, commercial use authorizations, and real property leases.  
The National Park Service manages approximately 600 concession contracts constituting more than $800 million of business annually.  The NPS estimates it issues over 2,000 commercial use authorizations and a number of leases (where the NPS is the lessor and a private party is the lessee) as well.  As part of these federal contracts and authorizations, the private party operator must obtain insurance for, among other reasons, protecting real property improvements, visitors to units of the National Park System, and the resources of the parks.  As the federal government is a self-insured entity, the NPS has determined that it is necessary to obtain professional consultative services on a routine basis to determine the scope of coverage it should require for each new contract or type of services provided as well as to obtain accurate and timely estimates of the cost of such coverage in order to accurately evaluate the financial profile of each concession opportunity.  The NPS also has determined that it is necessary to obtain professional consultative services on a routine basis to review and potentially revise the minimum required insurance limits or additional types of insurance on existing contracts, provided that any additional requirements are reasonable and consistent with the types of insurance a prudent businessperson would purchase in similar circumstances.  In addition, from time to time, the NPS receives questions regarding the characteristics and nature of various types of insurance held by our concessioners, lessees, and permit holders.  The services provided would include the ability to respond to request such as these on a routine basis.  Finally, the NPS has determined that the consultant would develop and provide training to federal employees in the program from the park to headquarters levels.
Interested contractors must possess a thorough understanding of insurance products and the state of the insurance industry in commercial liability, environmental liability, casualty (including marine casualty), and other categories that may be appropriate for concessioners and other commercial operators in the National Park System.  The range of services provided range from high-end hotel operations, food and beverage services, and merchandise retail to high risk recreational services such as mountain climbing and white water raft trips.  The types of structures leased range from residences to large historic structures.  A familiarity with federal law and regulations under the Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 and the leasing provisions of 36 CFR Part 18 is useful but not necessary.  For additional information, interested contractors should go to:  http://concessions.nps.gov

The NPS requests all interested parties submit information that addresses the following:  (1) Experience: The contractor must describe their experience in (a) evaluating risk and insurance coverage requirements in the hospitality and recreation industries; (b) defining appropriate coverage for leased structures; and (c) training on insurance; (2)  Small Business Status:  It is anticipated that the NAICS code for this acquisition will be 52498 with a small business size standard of $6.5M; and (3) The services related to this Sources Sought, if any, that are available from interested contractors on GSA Schedule.
This sources sought request is due to the POC identified herein no later than 8 July 2008, close of business.  You must submit your responses electronically via email to the attention of Eric Nolte, Contract Specialist at eric_nolte@nps.gov, phone number 303-987-6977.  The response may not exceed twenty (20) pages.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND A CONTRACT WILL NOT BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCenter (SPAWARSYSCEN), Charleston,hereafter referred to as SSCC, issoliciting information from potentialsources to provide Single Battery PowerUnits (SBPU) and Triple Battery PowerUnits (TBPU) for use with the MarineCorps Tactical Remote Sensor SystemsSystem-of-System (TRSS SoS).  TheTRSS SoS uses hand-emplacedsensors to support the fieldcommanders intelligence collectioneffort by providing continuous, widearea surveillance of the battlefield.Two battery powered unit configurationsare required.  The SBPU has beendesigned and only requires full rateproduction in accordance with the SBPUTechnical Data Package (TDP).  TheTBPU has not been designed; SSCCrequires the awardee to design,develop, test, qualify, and produce theTBPU in accordance with the TBPUSystem Specification.The SBPU is a lightweight enclosurethat houses a single BA-5x90/U seriesbattery to provide 12 VDC power toTRSS SoS devices.  The SBPU has twointegrated 13-pin connectors that allowfor cable connection to equipment andfor daisy-chaining up to three SBPUtogether to extend the TRSS SoSmission duration.  The SBPUconfiguration items include the batterybox and two cables.  The SBPUincludes a data pass through featurethat allows data signals to be passedconcurrently while power is beingsupplied.  SSCC requires that the SBPUbe built as prescribed by the SBPU TDP.The TBPU will house three BA-5x90/Useries batteries and is functionalequivalent to the SBPU.  The TBPU willhave two integrated 13-pin connectorsthat allow for cable connection toequipment and for daisy-chaining up totwo TBPU together to extend the TRSSSoS mission duration.  The TBPUconfiguration items will include thebattery box and two cables.  The TBPUincludes a data pass through featurethat allows data signals to be passedconcurrently while power is beingsupplied.  SSCC requires that the SBPUTechnical Data Package be utilized asa baseline for the design anddevelopment of the TBPU.  SSCCrequires a TBPU TDP to be deliveredprior to Low Rate Initial Production(LRIP); this TDP shall be a completeProduct Level Drawing Package thatcomplies with ASME Y14.100, ASMEY14.24 and ASME Y14.34M and includeassembly drawings and detaileddrawing down to the piece part foritems designed and developed atgovernment expense.Major Milestones.  The SBPU majormilestones include First Article Test andProduction Acceptance Test; bothrequire government approval.   TheTBPU major milestones includePreliminary Design Review, CriticalDesign Review, FunctionalConfiguration Audit, First Article Test,Physical Configuration Audit andProduction Acceptance Test; all requiregovernment approval.General Delivery Requirements.  TheSBPU effort requires the manufactureof up to 2,000 SBPUs, which are built inaccordance with a prescribed set ofProduct Drawings (Qualification andProduction only).  The TBPU requiresthe manufacture of up to 1,200 TBPUs,which are built in accordance with aprescribed system specification(design, qualification, and production).Both battery box efforts also includethe delivery of data associated withsystem design, development,production, and logistics support.Intended Application of Battery Boxes.The battery power units are required topower unattended devices for aminimum of 120 days in outdoorenvironments within the temperaturerange of 30 to +62 degrees C.  Twoconfigurations are required - one thatholds a single battery, and one thathouses three batteries.  The batteryboxes are TRSS devices that allow theattachment of external power sources.The systems ability to be lightweightand man-packed to remote locations isessential.The Government desires SBPUs to bebuilt per an existing Product Drawing.Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS)solutions for the TBPU, if available,and in compliance with the TBPUspecification are required.Industry firms capable ofaccomplishing the required services, inwhole or by teamed effort, are invitedto submit an affirmative response tothis notice.  The Government isinterested in rapid delivery of low-weight solutions that can withstand theenvironmental requirements, whichinclude a 24-hour immersionthreshold.  Partial solutions will not beconsidered.It is anticipated that a solicitation willbe issued for a Commercial typecontract issued under the testprocedures of FAR Part 13.5.  Theapplicable NAICS code is 335999 with asize standard of 500 employees.Firms are invited to submitdocumentation (any literature,brochures, and references) necessaryto support that they possess therequired capabilities necessary to meetor exceed the stated requirements.There is a five-page limitation for alldata submitted.  Responses mustinclude the following: (1) name andaddress of firm; (2) size of business,including: average annual revenue forpast three years and number ofemployees; (3) ownership (includingCountry of Ownership), indicatingwhether: Large, Small, SmallDisadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned,HUBZone, Veteran- Owned and/orService-Disabled- Veteran-OwnedBusiness, and Central ContractorRegistration (CCR) information; (4)number of years in business; (5) twopoints of contact, including: name,title, phone, fax, and e-mail address;(6) DUNS Number; (7) affiliateinformation:  parent corporation, jointventure partners, potential teamingpartners, prime contractor (if potentialsubcontractor) or subcontractors (ifpotential prime); (8) Product literaturein PDF format that identifies the abilityto meet the requirements listed aboveor identify proposed unit that meets allrequirements listed above.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this synopsis.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small and Large Business Community to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract.  The Government is seeking qualified, experienced sources capable if executing a wide variety of environmental projects.<BR><BR>The Army has developed six program areas to meet these goals:  Restoration, Compliance, Prevention, Conservation, Technology and Real Estate.  These programs form the basis of the Norfolk District's Management Support Program.  The goal of restoration is to clean contaminated sites based on health and safety risks.  By applying good business practices, a results-oriented cleanup program allows for more viable use of the land for the military, Federal agencies, states and local communities.  Compliance activities ensure that current operations comply with Federal, state, local and applicable host nation environmental requirements and regulations.  Such laws and regulations include but are not limited to wastewater discharge, other point and non-point source controls, drinking water quality, endangered species, noise abatement, wetlands, air quality attainment, above ground/underground storage tanks, radon, asbestos, historic properties, solid and hazardous materials/waste management, pest management and sewage treatment.  Prevention activities focus on proactively eliminating the potential for pollution to the greatest extent possible, and require the reduction of hazardous materials use and hazardous waste generation.  This includes life-cycle management, accident prevention and response, source reduction, implementation of a materiel and waste tracking system (such as the Hazardous Substances Management System (HSMS)), and the use of products, processes, practices and other measures that reduce or eliminate hazardous materials use and hazardous waste generation.  Conservation activities focus on conserving, protecting, and enhancing natural and cultural resources.  The main purpose of conservation is to ensure the long-term integrity of valuable resources, such as air quality, local and regional water supply, wetlands, forestry, flora and fauna, soil sediment, endangered species habitat and historic and cultural properties.  Focused science in environmental technology has become an increasingly critical area of support to our present and prospective customers.  Existing technologies are used to support each of the above programs, but as Federal mandates to protect our environment increase and resources decrease, it is vital to develop and leverage innovative technologies and processes to solve recurring and foreseeable issues.  Support may also be necessary for real estate programs of Federal agencies, requiring the need to develop strategies for acquisition, excessing and disposal, and transfer of real estate to and from government agencies.  We may also request real estate requirements be developed for implementation and execution of activities and programs that have an impact on acquisition, management and/or disposal of real property.<BR><BR>Capacity and capability to perform work on a wide variety of site located within the United States, its territories and possessions in a manner that complies with Federal, State and Local regulations and laws.  It is anticipated that multiple projects may be awarded simultaneously to the selected firms.  Firms shall demonstrate adequate team capacity to coordinate and manage multiple task orders concurrently to meet requires milestones.  This is indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for a base period of twelve months with four option periods of twelve months each.    <BR><BR>The Government is requesting that interested firms furnish the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address. (2) Type of Business Size under NACIS Code 541620.  (3) Provide a general statement of your capabilities.  (4) Demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence relevant to management support programs and provide a minimum of three examples within the past two years.  (5) Describe ability to perform work in various geographic locations and how that pertains to ability to performance nation-wide<BR><BR>Submit all responses by fax or email to ATTN: Veronica McGuire, Fax 757-201-7183, Ph 757-201-7366, veronica.a.mcguire@usace.army.mil.  <BR>

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in developing aproposal addressing the goals and objectives of NASA Research Announcement (NRA)NNH08ZDA001N-ACT Appendix A.21 Advanced Component Technologies. The NRA, Appendix A.21can be accessed at http://esto.nasa.gov/obs_technologies.html	.  Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses andwomen-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation by non-U.S.organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, in whicheach government supports its own national participants and associated costs.The objectives of the ACT Program are to research, develop, and demonstrate component-and subsystem-level technology developments that:	Reduce the risk, cost, size, volume, mass, and development	time of Earthobserving instrument and platforms, and	Enable new Earth observation measurements.This segment of the overall ESTO program advances core component technologies to atechnology readiness level (TRL) that enables them to graduate to other programs, suchas the Instrument Incubator Program, or to directly infuse them into a mission.This opportunity focuses on advancing the components and subsystem technologies necessaryto implement the measurements that are described in the National Research Council'sDecadal Survey (Reference: Earth Science and Applications from Space: NationalImperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, ISBN: 0-309-66900-6 (2007) or access a freepdf download from http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html   ). Measurements called for inthe Decadal Survey have been assembled into fourteen (14) mission concepts with startdates ranging from 2010 to 2020 for implementation by NASA. The favored sensor for the 3-D Winds mission is a pulsed, hybrid, Doppler lidar system inearth orbit. A hybrid Doppler lidar consists of both a coherent-detection anddirect-detection Doppler lidar subsystems. The long ranges from orbit to the atmospherecreate the requirement for a large diameter beam expanding telescope, relative toground-based applications.Specifically, LaRC is seeking potential partner(s) with capabilities in the followingareas:1. Development of optical engineering software capable of modeling a space-based coherentDoppler lidar system. The software must allow many kinds of optics to be modeledincluding beam splitters and optical coatings. Modeling of the transmitter and localoscillator laser beams is required. It must include coherent beam propagation and lightfield phase and polarization effects. It must include calculation of the far-fieldtransmitted and back propagated local oscillator fields. Calculation of the heterodyneefficiency of the coherent lidar system is required, which uses the two far-field opticalfields. It must have a WYSIWYG display and user interface that permits any opticalcomponent to be specified to have any chosen level of any aberration type. 2.  Space mission optics design, specification, procurement, and fabrication for opticsup to 50 cm in diameter. Optical design for coherent lidar systems. Expertise in the areaof all types of optical aberrations. Understanding of the procurement of space opticswith diameters up to 50 cm, and the tradeoffs between specified aberrations levels of thedifferent types of aberrations, the cost, the risk, the delivery time, and the number ofavailable sources. It is expected that selected partner(s) will work with NASA Langley Research Centerscientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal and perform the proposed tasksif the proposal is selected. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules andcost estimates. Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria inthe following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of keypersonnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, pastperformance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform thedevelopment and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidenceof successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposers ability to controlboth cost and schedule. The ability of the proposer to complete projects on time andwithin the modest, fixed budgets that are characteristic of Advanced Component Technologyis key. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost andschedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes inthis area.   RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to eight(8) pages in not less than 12-point font. Responses must address each of theaforementioned evaluation criteria. All responses shall be submitted to LaRC via e-mailby 5:00 PM EST on June 19, 2008 to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov. Technical and Programmatic questions should be directed to: Rosemary Baize atRosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov.  Procurement questions should be directed to:Liliana.j.Richwine@nasa.gov.

<DESC>On behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Investigations (OI), the Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center plans to award a sole source simplified acquisition to Clearwell Systems, Inc. located at 2901 Tasman Drive Suite 100 Santa Clara, California 95054-1137. The purpose of this requirement is to purchase the following products: (1) Search Only License Upgrade for 3 Email Intelligence Platforms; (2) Support and Maintenance Upgrade from 450 Gigabytes to 1 Terabyte through 3/30/09; and (3) Support on the Hardware and Software purchased in the previous order with Clearwell to end co-terminus on 3/30/09.

In August of 2007, HHS OIG purchased an additional Clearwell Server and Hardware Maintenance to support additional investigative data. In order to support additional Clearwell cases, OIG needs to upgrade their software license from 450 GB to 1 TB. Their cases are currently backlogged, pending this upgrade. By purchasing the software license upgrade, they will be able to process cases faster and lessen the wait time on existing cases.

The OIG, Office of Investigations (OI) conducts investigations of fraud and misconduct to safeguard the Department’s programs and protect its beneficiaries. OI concentrates its resources on criminal investigations, but its activities are also aimed at deterring fraud and abuse by identifying systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be mitigated through corrective management actions, regulation, or legislation; and by pursuing criminal convictions and recovering damages and penalties through civil and administrative proceedings.

Due to the ever increasing amount of electronic data, in particular, e-mail, which is obtained pursuant to our criminal, civil, and administrative investigations, the OI, Seized Computer Evidence Recovery Staff (SCERS) is finding it more and more difficult to sift through the data and provide useful results to case agents in a timely manner.  Current e-mail analysis methodologies require time consuming searches of individual e-mail accounts which must be manually linked from one e-mail account to the next.  In addition, the number of search warrants conducted by OI results in SCERS personnel being in travel status for a large percentage of their time.  This reduces the amount of time they have to spend conducting analysis of the evidence obtained. 

To address this shortfall, OI implemented a software solution that is capable of analyzing multiple e-mail accounts, can associate/link e-mails contained in multiple accounts based on both content and metadata, is server based, has an easy to use web interface, and can log actions so as to easily identify and replicate search methods used.  

In early 2006, SCERS purchased 2 copies of Clearwell Systems Inc.'s standalone e-mail analysis software.  The software was purchased to complete e-mail analysis for an investigation requiring the case agent to sort through large amounts of e-mail data.  The case was overwhelmingly successful using the stand-alone version of the software.  Since the initial procurement, the stand-alone units have been utilized to aide in additional investigations.  However, since each license is installed on a stand-alone laptop, OI is unable to use each license for any more than one case at a time and one agent at a time.  By taking this technology from a standalone version to a server based solution, it allowed OI to take full advantage of this technology by allowing up to 3 investigations per license and allowed multiple agents to conduct search/analysis on an investigation from anywhere within our organization without requiring units to be shipped from one person to the next.  In addition to the 2 upgrades in August 2007, OI purchased a third license to establish an initial operating capability of a minimum of 9 investigations at a time.    

The OIG completed a thorough assessment of multiple network based e-mail analysis vendors to fulfill our mission need.  Products from Clearwell Systems Inc., Kazeon, and Attenex were reviewed.  During the assessment one vendor stood above the rest by providing a single web based interface for discovering, analysis, and case management. Clearwell was the only product to provide discussion threads to link together all related messages into chronological threads which capture the entire email discussion. This enables agents to quickly identify information for their case instead of sifting through a lot of false positives.   

Clearwell - Key Capabilities:

•	Discussion Threads Visualization - Discover WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN 
•	De-duplication - Analyze duplicate emails & documents only once 
•	“Google-like” Relevance Ranking - Review the most relevant emails/files first 
•	Communication Flow tracking - Automatically track Group-to-Group, Internal-to-External or External-to-Internal, Domain–Domain communications
•	Nested Search - Easily construct complex searches and searches within a search 
•	Data Classification/annotation – User defined Tagging & Classification of data 
•	Export pertinent emails/documents to PST and/or PDF formats 
•	Collaborate across investigation teams and prosecutors

Since the Clearwell product has already been implemented as a stand-alone solution, many Seized Computer Evidence Recovery Staff and case agents are already utilizing the software.  This will reduce training requirements.  Also, the cost to upgrade the three existing licenses is significantly less than buying a new license, reducing the overall cost to reach our initial operating capability.  Finally, Clearwell has offered a 40% discount on all items, including the upgrades6+
 and annual support.  Based on our assessment, the OIG selects Clearwell Systems as its preferred vendor for price, functionality, and overall best value to the government.

Interested concerns capable of providing compatible products to the ones identified in the first paragraph may submit a capability statement outlining their products and the content of those products. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Following evaluation of capability statements, a determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer shall proceed with award to Clearwell Systems, Inc.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.<br />5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (JAN 2005) - This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment.<br />6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)<br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled<br />(i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and <br />(ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to<br />exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.<br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br />10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to-<br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or <br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />a.(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the fifth working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.<br />12.

If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.<br />15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees. <br />16.

TAXES (JAN 2005)<br />a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.<br />b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.<br />18.

If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.<br />b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to<br />(i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.<br />19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.<br />20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) - Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.<br />21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.<br />22. INVOICES (JAN 2005):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered.

Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.<br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

1.0		PROJECT TITLE
	EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPLEMENTAL ASSISTANCE
2.0	BACKGROUND
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has tested the FEMA trailers and found that there is a possibility of dangerous levels of Formaldehyde inside of the FEMA trailers.  Due to these tests, FEMA has decided to relocate as expeditiously as possible the remaining citizens who are still occupying FEMA trailers.  Part of accomplishing this task is providing for supplemental food assistance for households that do not have access to kitchen facilities while in interim housing, and that can show a need for assistance.
3.0	SCOPE
The goal of this SOW is to provide the necessary supplemental food assistance needed by eligible applicants placed in interim lodging that lacks kitchen facilities.  The intention is to provide renewable food vouchers for the purchase of food.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

1.0	Basis for Award:
Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government as determined by the evaluations described in this section.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the low price offeror or offeror with the highest merit rating after consideration of all factors.
2.0	Evaluation Guidance:
2.1	Selection of the successful offeror will be made based on the evaluation criteria stated below.  However, any proposal that is unrealistic, in terms of technical approach, schedule commitments, and or costs (high or low), will be deemed to have an inherent lack of technical competence, or to have failed to comprehend the complexity and risk of the Government’s requirement stated in the solicitation.
2.2	Evaluation Factors:  Selecting an offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three primary Factors:  (1) Past Performance, (2) Technical, and (3) Cost/Price.  Sub-Factors within these areas are detailed below.  A proposal that receives an “unacceptable” rating in any of the technical Sub-Factors will not be awarded a contract.
2.3	Evaluation Approach:  A team of Government personnel will evaluate all proposals.  The content of written proposals, as well as information derived from discussions/negotiations, if discussions are held, will be evaluated to determine the degree and extent to which the requirements and objectives set forth in the solicitation are satisfied.  The government reserves the right to award without discussions. No assumption will be made by Government evaluators regarding areas not defined in the offeror’s written material/information provided to the Government for evaluation.  The Factors will be evaluated using the following criteria:

Factors and Sub-factors	Criteria Description
Factor 1	Past Performance
Factor 2
Sub-Factor 1
Sub-Factor 2
	Technical
Technical Scenario
Management Approach

Factor 3	Cost/Price

2.4	Relative Order of Importance:  Past Performance is more important than Technical and Cost/Price.  Technical and Cost/Price are of equal importance.  Within Technical, Sub-Factor 1 is more important than Sub-Factor 2. 
3.0	Evaluation Criteria:
3.1	Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated by the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and be given an adjectival rating of Low Risk, Moderately Low Risk, Moderate Risk, High Risk, or Unknown Risk.
3.1.1	The Past Performance volume will be evaluated to assess the relative risk associated with the offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the solicitation’s requirements as indicated by the offeror’s record of past performance.
3.1.2	The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the quality of the offeror’s past performance and its proposed subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.  When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the offeror and its proposed major subcontractors as it relates to all solicitation requirements.
3.1.3	In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Offerors with good past performance will be a lower risk than offerors with no past performance.  But, offerors with poor past performance will have a higher performance risk than offerors with no past performance.
3.1.4	A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process.  A negative finding under any element may result in an overall higher performance risk rating.  Therefore, offerors are reminded to include all relevant past efforts, including demonstrated corrective actions, as appropriate, in their proposal.
3.1.5	Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the government may use data provided by the offeror in its proposal and data obtained from other sources.  Since the government may not interview all sources provided by the offeror, it is incumbent upon the offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in proposals.  The burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors.
3.2	Technical:  The technical approach will be evaluated by the appropriate evaluation committee(s) of the SSEB and be given an adjectival rating of Excellent, Acceptable, Marginal, or Unacceptable.
3.2.1	Technical Scenario:  The offeror’s response to the Technical Scenario will be evaluated for the following:
a.	Understanding of Requirements:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which the proposed solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the logistics support required to include solving problems, and the extent to which uncertainties are identified and resolutions proposed.  Proposals that are found to be unrealistic in terms of the performance and schedule will be considered as indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexities inherent in the requirement.
b.	Feasibility of Approach:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which successful performance is contingent upon proven methods and techniques, and the extent to which the offeror’s methods and approach to the Technical Scenario are expected to result in successful completion of the proposed tasks and technical requirements within the required schedule.
c.	Completeness:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which requirements have been considered, defined, and satisfied, rating each proposal strictly in accordance with its content as presented in the offeror’s proposal for the Technical Scenario.  Evaluators will not assume that the offeror’s performance will include areas of investigation, or any effort not specified in its proposal.
3.2.2	Management Approach:  The offeror’s response to the Management Approach will be evaluated for the following:
a.	Understanding of Requirements:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of all management features involved in meeting the requirements.
b.	Feasibility of Approach:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which the proposed management approach is capable of satisfying requirements and is realistically achievable.  
c.	Completeness:  The proposal will be evaluated based upon the extent to which management requirements have been considered, defined, and satisfied, based upon the offeror’s written proposal.
3.3	Cost/Price
3.3.1	Contract Price will be evaluated using the offeror's overall contract proposal, the Government's Independent Estimate, and various Price Analysis techniques.  The Price Evaluation will consider Cost Realism Analysis.  In addition, the proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical approach proposed can be accomplished at the cost proposed.  The results of the Cost Realism Analysis will be applied to the evaluation of the technical area to aid in assessing the offeror's understanding of the magnitude and complexity of the contract requirements.
3.3.2	Cost may play an additional role since considerations of cost in terms of best value and affordability may be controlling in circumstances where two or more proposals are otherwise adjudged equal or when a technically superior proposal is at a cost that the Government cannot afford.

4.0	Evaluation Methodology:
4.1	The following adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate the offeror’s Past Performance.

Risk	Description
Low Risk	The Offeror’s past performance record provides little doubt that the Offeror will successfully provide performance that meets or exceeds our requirement.  Little Government intervention is expected to be required in obtaining the required performance.
Moderately Low Risk	The Offeror’s past performance record indicates the Offeror can successfully provide performance that meets our requirement.  Some Government intervention is expected to be required in obtaining the required performance.
Moderate Risk	The Offeror’s past performance record provides substantial doubt that the Offeror will successfully provide performance that meets our requirement.  Substantial Government intervention is expected to be required in obtaining the required performance.

High Risk	The Offeror’s past performance record provides extreme doubt that the Offeror will successfully provide performance that meets our requirement.  Regardless of the degree of Government intervention, obtaining the required performance is doubtful.

Unknown Risk	The Offeror has no relevant performance record.  A review was unable to identify any relevant past performance information (see FAR 15.305).  This is a neutral rating.  It does not hinder nor help the Offeror.

4.2	The following adjectival ratings will be used to rate the Technical Factors and Sub-Factors.

Rating	Description
Excellent	Evaluated with virtually no doubt that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. There are no significant weaknesses.  The levels of insight demonstrated in the Offeror’s proposal are such that little or no Government intervention is expected to be required in achieving the proposed level of performance.
Acceptable	Evaluated with certainty that the Offeror can successfully perform the required effort.  There are no significant weaknesses.  The levels of insight demonstrated in the Offeror’s proposal are such that some, but acceptable levels of, Government intervention may be required to meet the contract requirement.

Marginal	Substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  There are weaknesses that may be correctable. The levels of insight demonstrated in the Offeror’s proposal are such that substantial Government intervention is expected to be required to meet the contract requirements.  Changes to the Offeror’s existing approach may be necessary in order to achieve performance requirements.
Unacceptable	Extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  There are unacceptable weaknesses. The levels of insight demonstrated in the Offeror’s proposal are such that regardless of the degree of Government intervention, successful performance is doubtful.

The participants in this three-year program are competitively selected and are classified as contract specialists.  OCPO has identified areas of study that are now required for career placement and advancement in the 1102 Contract Specialist job series.

L	EVALUATION FACTORS:
Award will be made to the responsible quoter submitting an overall quote that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  Award will be made to the firm whose quote meets the Government’s requirements and whose technical performance and price represent the best value to the Government. The evaluation of quotes will be based on a technical evaluation of the Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, Experience in Successful Delivery of the Required Classes and Past Performance non-price evaluation factors.  Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements and Experience are equally important to the Past Performance.  When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (1) Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements, (2) Experience and (3) Past Performance are significantly more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions.  Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoter’s best terms. 
Ability to Meet the SOW Requirements:  The quoter must demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements as set forth in the SOW.  Provide evidence of Defense Acquisition University (DAU) course equivalency and evidence of American Council on Education (ACE) accreditation.  Include a statement of how many college credits will be awarded for each course.  Provide resumes that demonstrate the qualifications of the instructors who are available to teach the courses.  Based upon this, the quote will be evaluated on:  Demonstrated ability to meet the requirements in the specific areas specified under Description/Scope of Work F. REQUIREMENTS Training Specifications, Program Requirements and Instructor Qualification Requirements.  Resumes must be received for all instructors being offered under this RFQ.  Resumes shall not exceed 3 pages in length.  All resumes must include a signed statement by the offered individual that they either currently work for the educational institution and will work under the resulting award or will accept employment if the quoter receives the award based upon the resume submitted.  
Experience in Successful Delivery of the Required Classes:  The Government will evaluate the experience of each quoter.  The quoter shall discuss its experience in providing CON 100 – Shaping Smart Business Arrangements and CON 110 – Mission Support Planning.  Based upon this, the quote will be evaluated on:  Demonstrated experience in successful delivery of the courses specified under Description/Scope of Work B. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE. 
Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate relevant past performance of each quoter.  The quoter shall identify five (5) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government or commercial organizations that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.  Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.  Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.  Please include the following information:  a) Course Title, b) Description of the Course, c) Contract/Task Order Number, d) Contract/Task Order Amount, e) Government Agency/ Organization, f) COTR’s name, address, phone number and email address, g) Contracting Officer’s name, address, telephone number and email address, h) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates, i) List of courses delivered to customer including delivery date and j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task. 
Quoter’s shall not include any price information in the technical quote.
PRICE:  The price quote shall include the Firm Fixed Price for each required course and the Total Firm Fixed Price.  The firm fixed price shall include all costs required to deliver the courses including facilities, travel of instructor to exclude local travel, training materials, etc.  The Price Quote must contain the Firm Fixed Price information along with the Representations and Certifications identified in Paragraph K of this combined synopsis/solicitation.  
The technical quote submission shall be limited to 12 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.) and the past performance section shall be limited to 2 one-sided pages (also inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.)  The price quote has no page limitations.  All quotes should be provided with a cover page and table of contents for both the Technical and the Price sections.  No pricing information is to be provided within the quoter’s technical quote.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Filing Agency Protests
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the 
ADDENDA TO FAR 52.212-4
                          CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Feb 2007)

Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 
Synopsis: 
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25, effective April 22, 2008.

One objective was completed when the Agency published new draft and final Part 11 GMP Guidance for notice and comment.  The draft guidance was published February 23, 2003, and the final guidance was published August 2003.

Scope of Work
Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to the performance of the work as described below.

FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Compliance, seeks a contractor that has the depth and breath of understanding of the issues of the Part 11 “Electronic Records, Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application.”  This contract will continue the efforts initiated in 2005-2006 and expand these to include the preparation of a revised Part 11 Regulation.  This contract will include preparing, editing and reviewing pharmaceutical industry comments in preparation for a finalized and revised 21 CFR Part 11.  Further, since additional Guidance for Industry may be required, in that the Regulation will be changed, the contractor will also assist with material necessary for the preparation and publication of draft and final industry guidance.  At the discretion of the government, the contractor will also provide technical assistance in writing and editing regulation language, preparing documentation for a Federal Register notice, and making revisions to various Agency documents as necessary in support of the Part 11 initiative.

EVALUATION FOR AWARD
Basis for Award:
a. Proposals received will first be evaluated from a technical standpoint without regard to proposed cost. Those proposals considered to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated from a financial and management standpoint.
b. Technical factors are significantly more important than cost or price. It is pointed out, however, that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost or price could become primary.
c. FDA will base its award decision using a best value analysis that results in the most advantageous acquisition for the government. FDA’s acquisition strategy used to obtain best value may result in an award to other than the lowest priced, technically rated offeror. Best value analysis spans a continuum from the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to those proposals in which tradeoffs between price, past performance, and each offeror’s technical solution is evaluated. This tradeoff process (see FAR 15.101-1) depends on the government’s assessment of quality factors, including but not limited to past performance, compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications and prior experience, and price.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Area Details Percentage

ATTACHMENT I

FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements

1.  BACKGROUND

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type.  

Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation requirement.  These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space.

2.  GENERAL

The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract:

a.	Certification that all required security form packets (See Charts A and/or B incorporated in this clause) and a list of contractor employees names for whom the requisite security information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff.

   b.  "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms
         signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.

With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor.  The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.  

Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for details on the badging process)  However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times. 

All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations.  The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract.

The position risk levels for this contract are Level 1.

There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are:

a.	Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the Agency.  The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1).  Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in Paragraph 5 below.

b.	Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs.  The forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6).  Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive security badge as well as a background investigation.

In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following information:  (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g) phone number.  The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system.  Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor.

A Contractor’s failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor’s employees being denied access to FDA property until all security processing has been completed.

3. BADGING PROCESS  

The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card.  In order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a “favorable” fingerprint return.  Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work.   Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on where the contract will be performed:

a.  Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee, contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or

b.  Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to:

Food and Drug Administration
Personnel Security Staff, OSO
5600 Fishers Lane
PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
Rockville, MD 20857

Upon the receipt of a “favorable” fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive his or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document.  Acceptable forms of photo identification are referenced on the FDA Form 3391.  Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form.  This form can be obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf

An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff. 

4.  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS

The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 1, 5 and 6 serving under this contract.  

Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to:

•	Review of prior Government/military personnel records;
•	Review of FBI records and fingerprint files;
•	Searches of credit bureaus;
•	Personal interviews; and
•	Written inquiries covering the subject's background.			
		
Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of contract performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate background investigations of contractor employees.

The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In addition, the contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes:  the Contractor's name, the contract number, the name of the Contracting Officer administering the contract, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those employees’ social security numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a separate sealed envelope marked, "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to:

Food and Drug Administration
OSO/Office of Security Operations
Attn:  Personnel Security Staff
5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN 15A-22, HFA-640
Rockville, MD  20857

The contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the contract number and employee names.

The contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations.

Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the contract employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms.

Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position.

At any time, if a contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the contract, the contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and Contracting Officers.

The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days.  The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an employee is denied a clearance.  Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the contract.  Those who are not cleared must cease work on the contract immediately.

If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required.

In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of this clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer.

6.  NON-PUBLIC DATA PROTECTION

The contractor shall protect the privacy of all information reported by or about contract employees and shall protect against unauthorized disclosure.

The following response is provided to technical question submitted:

QUESTION:  Regarding the 16th bullet "Leak detector must have the ability to leak check at atmosphere with an external pump on the system," it is our understanding the leak detector must have a sniffer probe.  Is this correct?

ANSWER:  The leak detector must have the ability to accommodate a sniffer probe if NIST decides to use this feature in the future.  For this quotation, the sniffer probe is not required.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; THEREFORE PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION BECAUSE NONE EXISTS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE OF INTENT.</strong></p>
<p>This amendment replaces the statement of work (SOW) posted on 4/28/08 with a revised SOW dated 6/05/08 and provided as an attachment to this special notice.&nbsp; Interested offerors may respond to this special notice by submitting a capability statement in accordance with the instructions included in the last paragraph of this notice (see below).&nbsp; The response time and date is hereby extended until 2:00pm ET, 6/13/08.&nbsp; The government will not consider responses received after the due date and time.&nbsp;The capability statement must address the THEO proprietary software compatibility requirements relatve to the revised SOW dated 6/05/08.</p>
<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) works to prevent violence before it begins (primary prevention). Prevention requires understanding the factors that influence violence. CDC uses a four-level, social-ecological model (i.e. Prevention Matrix) to better understand violence and the effect of potential prevention strategies. The Prevention Matrix takes into consideration the complex interplay between individual, relationship, community and societal factors. It allows the factors that put people at risk for experiencing or perpetrating violence to be analyzed.</p>
<p>A well coordinated set of tools explaining the concept of primary prevention and the principles that accompany it does not currently exist. Accordingly, DVP has a requirement for the development of an interactive, computerized version of the Prevention Matrix, a tool that helps explain primary prevention and the social-ecological model to DVP grantees and partners.</p>
<p>CDC posted a sources sought synopsis (copy attached) on April 10, 2007 identifying Banyan Communications, Inc. (Banyan) as the only known, responsible source capable of satisfying the requirement to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix using educational theory (Heuristic Engagement). Banyan will use its proprietary software development tool called THEO, a trade marked educational platform developed by Banyan, to develop the interactive computerized version of the Prevention Matrix. THEO uses proven educational theory (Heuristic Engagement). No other source offers THEO.</p>
<p>The CDC responded to one inquiry to the April 10, 2007 synopsis, however, no interested offeror successfully demonstrated a capability to meet the minimum requirements identified in the statement of work (copy attached). Accordingly, the CDC awarded purchase order 200-2007-M-21749 to Banyan dated 7/13/2007 for $643,434.</p>
<p>The CDC requires additional services (see attached modified statement of work) from Banyan and thus intends to negotiate a bi-lateral modification to the purchase order with Banyan for the additional services and extend the period of from September 30, 2008 to September 30, 2009.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on May 9, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.</p>
<p><strong>The capability statement must include an explanation of how the offeror proposes to perform the additional services using the existing web portal designed by Banyan Communications using its proprietary THEO software development tool while ensuring compatibility and meeting the delivery schedule stipulated in the attached statement of work.</strong> A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Lionel Nadeau at: lnadeau@cdc.gov</p>

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>DOS A/LM/AQM Memorandum dated 04/23/08: GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/II requires this additional SAN shelf to provide capacity for  a potential growth of 40% of applicants.  Per the manufacturer, the DAE2 (2-gigabit disk-array enclosure) is a highly available, high-performance, high-capacity storage system that uses a Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) as its interconnect interface.  An enclosure connects to another DAE2 or a storage processor, and is managed by storage-system software in RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disk) configurations.  The enclosure is only 3U (5.25 inches) high, but can include 15 hard disk drives.  Its modular, scalable design provides additional disk storage as your needs increase.  The DAE2 can support up to fifteen 3.5-inch, Fiber Channel disk modules.  It uses the Fiber Channel interface to connect disk modules together.  Simple serial cabling provides easy scalability.  You can interconnect as many as eight DAE2s to Fiber Channel loops (sometimes called busses) to form a large disk storage system.  The number of loops depends on the capabilities of your storage processor; highly available configurations require at least two loops, other configurations use a single loop.  You can place the disk enclosures in the same cabinet, or in one or more separate cabinets.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure is required as the EDV program is currently housed and processed on DELL equipment.  The requested DELL Disk Drives will be an upgrade to the existing equipment and is the only product that the DELL vendor will support.The Dell EMC DAE2 2Gb Disk Array Enclosure has undergone test and assessment and has received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   This is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal including the use of any appropriate small business programs.
The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential qualified 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and Small Business firms for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Environmental Planning and Engineering Services for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Executive Order (EO) 12114, Environmental Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions. The preponderance of work to be assigned under this contract will be NEPA documentation in support of proposed infrastructure-related actions related to AIRCRAFT HOMEBASING issues.  The geographic area covered by this contract encompasses the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic's area of responsibility (AOR) and the adjacent waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The preponderance of the work on this contract is anticipated to occur within NAVFAC Atlantic's AOR, which includes the Continental United States, the Caribbean, Europe and North Africa. Taskings, however, could be assigned anywhere in the world.  After review of the responses submitted, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities website if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The Government intends to solicit and award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type contract with an estimated total amount not to exceed $30,000,000 for all years.  The contract term will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional one year option periods. Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330, Engineering Services, and the annual small business size standard is $4,500,000.
The documents to be prepared under this contract include:  Categorical Exclusions (CATEX), Environmental Assessments (EA) and Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) under NEPA, as well as Environmental Reviews and Environmental Studies under EO 12114.  The preponderance of work to be assigned under this contract will be NEPA documentation in support of proposed infrastructure-related actions related to aircraft homebasing issues.  However, other tasks may be assigned.  Some examples of taskings could include homebasing of aircraft, new construction, renovation, and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions and demolitions.  General guidelines for preparation of the NEPA documentation are contained in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations (40 CFR part 1500 et. seq.) and Navy Instructions as published, 32 CFR Part 775 and OPNAVINST 5090.1C.   Guidance for preparing EO 12114 documents is contained in OPNAVINST 5090.1C, Appendix E.  In order to complete these documents, some of the following related studies and services may be required:  (1) Air Conformity Analyses under the Clean Air Act; (2) Wetland delineation and mitigation plans; (3) Cultural resource surveys (both architectural and archeological); (4) Coastal Zone Management consistency determinations; (5) Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultations, Biologic Surveys and Biological Assessments; (6) Community Impact Studies; (7) Environmental Justice Analyses; (8) Traffic Studies; (9) Water quality studies to include chemical and physical analysis of dredge material and bioassays; (10) Storm Water Management Studies; (11) Noise impact studies/modeling; (12) Toxic and hazardous waste studies; (13) Public Involvement Strategies; (14) Life Cycle Cost Analyses; (15) Land Use Compatibility (LUC) Plans; (16) Natural Resources Surveys; (17) Translation services for CATEX/EA/EIS and Public Notices; (18) Range hazard analysis; (19) At-sea acoustic analysis; (20) Marine Resource Assessments; (21) Marine Mammal Density estimates (22) Letters of Authorization and Incidental Harassment Authorizations;  (23) Essential Fish Habitat Assessments; and (24) Military Base Development Requirements.
The Government will evaluate sources capabilities from responding firms on the following: 
1.     Specialized Experience:  Firms and consultants, if proposed, will be evaluated in terms of their past experience with regard to the preparation of the above listed environmental documents and related studies and their knowledge of environmental regulations pertaining to this type of work.
2.     Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the staff assigned to this contract for the type of work addressed in Evaluation Factor #1:   Firms will be evaluated in terms of the staff's experience and active professional registration, and the capability to provide experienced, qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.
3.     Ability to perform the work to schedules and capacity to accomplish up to 3 concurrent taskings per year.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the staff's projected workload during the contract period.
4.     Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should demonstrate long term business relationships and repeat business with Government and private customers along with appropriate points of contact.  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.
5.     Quality Control Program:   Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to ensure technical accuracy and disciplined coordination of plans and specifications - list key personnel responsible.
6.     Firm location (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).   Firms will be evaluated on their location with respect to the general geographical area of the contract and their knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction practices of the area of the contract.   This evaluation factor applies to the office that will perform the work and not general office locations that will not be performing work under this contract.
7.     Volume of Work:   Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.
8.     Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:     Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 76.78%.   Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)  16.03%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) - 14.37%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) - 3%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 3%; and HUBZone Small Business  1.35%.
If the firm is considering entering into a teaming arrangement, provide the name of all teaming partners, the anticipated type of teaming arrangements, and address the specific services each member will provide and include applicable experience for each member.  For other than bundled requirements, you may be able to joint venture with one or more small businesses and not be considered affiliated as long as each member of the joing venture is considered Small under the applicable NAICS code (13 CFR 121.103(h)(3)).  The limitation on subcontracting would apply to the cooperative effort of the joint venture not each individual member (13 CFR 125.6(i)).
Interested firms should submit a brief capabilities statement (no longer than 20 double-sided pages) to the contracting office, demonstrating their ability to meet and execute the requirements as set forth above.
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms submitting responses shall present their information in a matrix format showing contracts they have performed.

<DESC><p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice to provide a synopsis of a proposed contract solicitation to interested parties. This Notice does not require a response from interested parties nor does it commit the Government to solicit or award a contract. Background The Rural Development area within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead federal entity in rural economic and community development. Rural Development accomplishes its mission by providing assistance to rural America through a network of 47 state offices and numerous other field office locations covering 50 states, plus the Pacific Trust Territories, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Rural Development&rsquo;s headquarters is located in Washington, District of Columbia, with additional operations in St. Louis, Missouri. Synopsis USDA Rural Development (Agency) intends to obtain technical support services to provide maintenance support and enhancement development to one of its official accounting and financial management systems - Automated Multi-housing Accounting System (AMAS). The Agency, as part of supporting its overall role in providing agricultural credit and rural development assistance for the Multiple Family Housing (MFH) loan and grant program, has initiated activities to develop and enhance Agency information management. The continued shift from internal Agency automated systems used by USDA employees to a combination of internal, intranet and internet systems serving our varied customers mandates improved and responsive automation support. The AMAS loan portfolio contains approximately 21,000 loans with an outstanding principal balance in excess of $11.8 billion. AMAS currently consists of about 400 COBOL (600,000 lines of code) programs and 9 subsystems. The on-line system is written primarily in ADS-0 with some usage of DC-COBOL, and is made up of about 300 maps and dialogs. There are approximately 300 Job Control Language (JCL) members. Structured programming techniques have been used. The choice of development tool set and architecture will be determined by the Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Technical Representative (COTR) using the suite of tools approved by the Agency. The various automated components, which support the Agency loan programs, are at different stages of development effort in an attempt to meet E-File/GPEA mandates. The architecture of these components is evolving from a pure block-mode, mainframe environment to one of web-enabled intranet, extranet, and internet capabilities interfacing with some legacy processes. Common processes are being shared between programs where feasible to reduce maintenance overhead. All new development is aimed at re-usability among programs. Rural Development requires software maintenance and enhancement support for AMAS. This may include supporting documentation modifications and/or improvements, designing and/or developing software maintenance/enhancements, testing, supporting data base changes, and supporting any new technologies that are introduced. Various requests for data occur sporadically through the year, coming from Office of Inspector General (OIG), General Accounting Office (GAO), or Congressional requests. These requests must also be fulfilled as part of the work duties assigned. Additionally, the Agency direct loan and grant program&rsquo;s automated components must comply with OMB Circular A-129 performance goals, the Treasury Financial Manual, Circular A-123 guidance for internal control systems, Circular A-127 guidance for financial management systems, and Circular A-130, guidance for security requirements. Consideration must also be given to the JFMIP Government-Wide systems automation requirements and the E-File/GPEA initiatives. Acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures. Full and Open competition will be exercised. The Government intends to award a single contract to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The contract will be for one (1) base year with four (4) option years to be exercised by the Government if found to be in its best interest. The approximate solicitation release date is May 27, 2008. The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fbo.gov . All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the website listed. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. Offerors must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) in order to transact business with USDA. Inquiries will only be accepted by email to the Point of Contact listed below. Interested parties shall submit proposals containing relevant pricing and service information as specified in the solicitation. Proposals must be received by 2:00 pm ET on June 13, 2008, and should be submitted electronically as instructed in the solicitation.</p>

DOCUMENT AUTHENTICITY FEATURE:  A 1-3/4 x 1” coating is to be applied to the back of the form (follow make-up dummy).  It must be translucent so that pre-printed information is legible from underneath the coating.  The coating must perform in such a way that, upon scratching or striking the area with a ball-point pen cap, thumbnail, or any non-metallic object, a permanent red, green, or blue image instantly appears.  The colored image must be clear and legible, and easily detected.  The coating must also be able to produce the colored image consistently over an extended period of time.
