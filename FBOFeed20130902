<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Illumina, Inc. 5200 Illumina Way, San Diego, CA 92121-1975, for the purchase of a custom Nextera Custom Enrichments Kits under the authority of FAR 13,106-1(b)(2), Soliciting from a single source. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.
<p>Project background. <br />Through collaboration with a network of international experts, the TGGU is committed to undertaking comprehensive genetic and genomic investigations of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), a rare but life-threatening form of juvenile arthritis whose causes are unknown. To this end, we have assembled a collection of genomic DNA from over 1000 sJIA patients from 20 medical centers in 9 countries - this is the largest collection of sJIA material ever assembled and it is an invaluable resource. We are in the final stages of preparing for submission the results of a genome wide association study (GWAS) of this sJIA collection, which identified over 50 regions of interest that warrant further investigation. To more thoroughly interrogate these regions of interest, we will next perform targeted deep re-sequencing of the sJIA patients and compare these data to the in-house exome sequence data from the Kastner group's fever cohort at NHGRI. The target regions of interest must be extracted or selected out of a patient's whole genomic DNA sample, and only the DNA from the selected regions is prepared for analysis on the sequencer. Because the sequence data from our control collection were all prepared using Illumina exome enrichment and sample preparation kits, it is necessary that we also utilize Illumina enrichment and sample preparation kits to avoid a bias between our case and control groups. Additionally, because we have very limited amounts of genomic DNA, less than 100 micrograms of DNA in many cases, it is imperative that we minimize the amount of genomic DNA required for this study to maximize the number of samples that may be included. <br />This acquisition is for the production and delivery of the custom-designed reagents that will be used to extract our genomic regions of interest and prepare them for Illumina sequencing using sample preparation chemistry that is fully compatible with our control dataset. Also, because the lab has very limited amounts of genomic DNA, less than 100 micrograms of DNA in many cases, it is imperative that the amount of genomic DNA required is minimized for this study to maximize the number of samples that may be included. <br />The period of performance will be one year.</p>
<p>The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that: <br />Only one source is available: The TGGU is establishing a program to comprehensively investigate the genetics and genomics of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. A critical tool to the ongoing success of this project is a collection of gDNA samples from over 1000 sJIA patients that has been collected in collaboration with colleagues around the world. This collection of gDNA is finite, and because it includes many historical samples that cannot be replaced, it is critical that we are diligent stewards acting to conserve this resource as we plan for future studies that will use this collection. Due to existing research being conducted, which requires that we also utilize Illumina chemistry in the enrichment and preparation of our samples. Nextera Custom Enrichment kit are completely compatible with our in-house control exome sequencing control data. <br /><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541711 - with a size standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being request and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis for to Illumina, Inc. San Diego, CA is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any information received as a result of this Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-69.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The non-manufacturer rule applies to this solicitation. Quoters must supply a product that their small business has manufactured or supply the product of a manufacturer that is a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Material Measurement Laboratory's (MML)/Gas Metrology Group (GMG) is committed to supporting the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) program, and the Clean Air Act. In order to satisfy these commitments, GMG must have the capability to:</p>
<p>1. Accurately produce primary gravimetric standards (PSMs) that are traceable to the SI unit of mass the kilogram (kg);<br />2. Accurately verify the concentration(s) of the PSMs; and<br />3. Accurately certify the concentration(s) of standards (SRMs, NTRMs, RGMs) underpinned by the PSMs.</p>
<p>A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer will support these capabilities. Currently, this is satisfied by a Thermo FTIR (Model: Nexus 670, NIST#: 59313), purchased in November, 1999. In addition to being an old spectrophotometer, this model does not meet the demands of the development of new, multi-component, low concentration standards (e.g. real air standards). Therefore, the purchase of a new spectrophotometer, with better resolution (than current 1/8th cm-1) and sensitivity (than current 0.1 ppm CH4 in a 10 m cell) , is necessary.</p>
<p>The new instrument will be used in gas research projects where the flexibility of resolution, spectral range, and sensitivity is essential.</p>
<p>Further, the instrument will be used in specific applications, namely the trace and certification analysis of gas mixtures:<br />Trace analysis:<br />Contaminants: H2O &lt; 1 ppm; CO2 &lt; 0.1 ppm; CO &lt; 0.1 ppm; CH4 &lt; 0.05 ppm; C3H8 &lt; 0.05 ppm</p>
<p>Gas Matrix: <br />Pure: N2 or Air<br />Gas Mixtures: CO in balance air or N2 (CO range up to <br />12%)<br />CO2 in balance air or N2 (CO2 range up to 20%)<br />CH4 in balance air of N2 (CH4 range up to 1%)<br />C3H8 in balance air or N2 (C3H8 range up to 1%)</p>
<p>Certification Analysis of Minor Component<br />The gas mixtures will be single minority component in balance air or N2. The list of minor components:<br />NH3 range: 10 to 200 ppm<br />Ethanol range: 20 ppm to 500 ppm<br />SO2 range: 20 - 3000 ppm<br />NO range: 20 - 3000 ppm<br />CO2 range: 1% to 20%<br />The relative analytical uncertainty (i.e. the uncertainty in the analysis only) is to be less than 0.5%for these components.</p>
<p>LINE ITEMS<br />All interested quoters shall provide a quote for all of the following line items:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) each research grade Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer meeting or exceeding all of the following minimum required specifications. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment shall not be considered for award.</p>

<p>2) Spectral Range: 500 to 4600 cm-1;</p>
<p>3) Optics: Purgeable by NIST house N2 or vacuum (to &lt; 1 mmHg);</p>
<p>4) Sample Compartment:Purgeable by NIST house N2 or vacuum (to &lt; 1 mmHg);</p>
<p>5) Compartment Configuration: Accommodate a 10 m folding path length Gas Cell;</p>
<p>6) Sensitivity: &lt;0.5 ppm CH4 per 1 m pathlength <br />(e.g. &lt; 0.05 ppm for 10 m Gas Cell);</p>
<p>7) Software: Able to issue commands to FTIR from NIST customized applications (developed using e.g. LabView, VB, .NET).</p>
<p>Line Item 0002: Installation<br />The Contractor shall provide installation for the spectrophotometer. Installation shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of all equipment, start-up, demonstration of specifications, and removal of all trash. Installation shall be completed not later than 30 days after delivery of the equipment to NIST. The Contractor must schedule installation in advance with the NIST technical contact. <br /><br />Line Item 0003: Training <br />The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate training for two or three NIST personnel, on-site at NIST Gaithersburg. The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, equipment operation, software functions and basic troubleshooting. The training may be completed on-site at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of specifications, however, must be completed not later than 30 days after successful completion of installation and demonstration of specifications.</p>
<p>Line Item 0004: Warranty<br />The Contractor shall provide a minimum one year warranty for the spectrophotometer. The warranty shall include all parts, labor and travel.</p>
<p>DELIVERY<br />Delivery shall be completed not later than eight weeks after award of the purchase order. Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.</p>

Please review Addendum to 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items for more information regarding how VA will evaluate each proposal.



ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
Offerors' proposals will be evaluated using the evaluation factors described below. Each proposal must address all elements listed in the Solicitation's Instructions to Offerors (FAR 52.212-1) and the corresponding addendum. Evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance with Technical Criteria being the most important aspect and Price being the least important. Please review the Addendum to the Instructions to Offerors for more details regarding what VA is looking for with each submittal.

EVALUATION FACTOR - 1: TECHNICAL CRITERIA:  The proposal shall clearly demonstrate the Offeror's knowledge and ability to successfully perform the work as it relates to the Statement of Work. The proposal will be judged on the quality and thoroughness of the technical information submitted. The evaluation board will look at the following criteria when evaluating the Offeror's technical proposal:

"	Demonstrates an ability to write a script for a training video. 
"	Demonstrates an ability to develop a curriculum pertaining to violence risk and threat assessment training.  
"	Demonstrates an ability to lead and coordinate a video-related project.
"	Demonstrates expert knowledge of program management activities, including organizing and scheduling meetings and timely production of all written deliverables. 
"	Demonstrates efficient and effective proficiency in meeting requirements.
"	Meets technical needs and mission requirements.
"	Personnel must possess necessary knowledge, skills and abilities in domain of workplace violence prevention.
"	Subject Matter Expert must meet all the requirements specified in Section 10 of the SOW.
"	Addresses the tasks and deliverables in the Statement of Work.
EVALUATION FACTOR - 2:  PAST PERFORMANCE:  The Offeror shall demonstrate successful past performance by providing recent and relevant past performance information on up to three (3) contracts for work completed within the past five years. This past performance should be similar to the size and scope of the requirement as it is laid out in the Performance Work Statement. 

The evaluation board will look at the following criteria when evaluating past performance:

Quality of Services	"	Compliance with contract requirements; accuracy of work and technical excellence
Corporate Experience	"	Address prior experience and effectiveness of the firm with projects of similar scope and magnitude, including demonstrated experience working with a major federal agency with an emphasis on health care 
Customer Satisfaction	"	Satisfaction of the client and end users with the Offeror's services
Timeliness of Performance	"	Met interim milestones; reliable to technical direction; completed on time, including wrap up and contract administration; and no liquidated damages assessed

The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources.  Past performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractor's past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.

EVALUATION FACTOR 3:  PRICE
Price will not receive any sort of adjectival rating. The Contracting Officer will judge price strictly on the total value of the requirement and the itemized breakdown. Each Offeror's price must be realistic and reasonable to receive consideration for this award. The price should reflect a thorough understanding of the Statement of Work. 

Price will become more significant as a distinguishing factor if the difference between vendors' technical proposals and past performance ratings are negligible.
EVALUATION RATING SYSTEM:             
The Government will use the ratings below to assess the aforementioned evaluation factors. The technical criteria evaluation criteria ratings apply to evaluation factor 1 while the past performance evaluation criteria applies to evaluation factor 2.

Technical Criteria Evaluation Criteria (Factor 1)
Rating	Definition
Exceptional	Technical capabilities exceed essentially all solicitation requirements and demonstrate an excellent understanding of the requirements. Technical capabilities have numerous strengths and virtually no weaknesses. Excellent probability of success with overall very low degree of risk in meeting Government's requirements.
Very Good	Technical capabilities meet all and exceed some solicitation requirements and demonstrate a good understanding of the requirements. Technical capabilities include some strengths and negligible weaknesses. Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.
Satisfactory	Technical capabilities adequately meet all solicitation requirements and demonstrate an adequate understanding of the requirements.  No real advantages are offered.  Strengths are insignificant and weaknesses are minor. If there are any significant strengths, they are offset by significant weaknesses. Good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.
Marginal	Technical capabilities meet some, but not all solicitation requirements. There is evidence of marginal understanding of the requirements.  No advantages are offered.  There are virtually no strengths and may be minor weaknesses are present. If there are any strengths, they are offset entirely by weaknesses. Probability of success is poor and the overall degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements is moderate.
Unacceptable	Technical capabilities meet few, if any, solicitation requirements. There is evidence of inadequate understanding of the requirements. There are essentially no strengths and weaknesses are significant. Any strength is overwhelmingly offset by numerous or significant weaknesses. Probability of success is very poor and the overall degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements is high. 







Past Performance Evaluation Criteria (Factor 2)
Rating	Definition
Substantial Confidence	Based on the Offeror's performance record essentially no doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The past performance record indicates that the Offeror successfully completed projects of essentially the same size and scope in the past.
Significant Confidence	Based on the Offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The past performance record indicates that the Offeror successfully completed projects of similar size and scope in the past.
Satisfactory Confidence	Based on the Offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The past performance record indicates that the Offeror completed projects of similar size and scope in the past but may have experienced minor difficulties on the way to completion.
Little Confidence	Based on the Offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The past performance record indicates that the Offeror had difficulty completing projects of similar size and scope and may require Government oversight or intervention to perform the required effort.
No Confidence	Based on the Offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. The past performance record indicates that the Offeror struggled mightily or was unable to complete projects of similar size and scope in the past.
Unknown/Neutral	No past performance record identifiable.
