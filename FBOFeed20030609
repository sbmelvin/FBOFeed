<DESC>Joint Modeling and Simulation System (JMASS) Request For Information (RFI)       The Command and Control Enterprise Integration (C2EI)Office at Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB is requesting information, on behalf of all of the JMASS partners (including Army and Navy), from industry for business approaches to obtain market research data to assist in developing Joint Modeling and Simulation System (JMASS) sustainment and enhancement planning.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request For Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. The Joint Modeling and Simulation System (JMASS) program http://www.redstone.army.mil/amrdec/jmass/ is a systems-level software architecture and infrastructure that supports modeling and simulation analysis for the acquisition, engineering, and test and evaluation communities. The JMASS process fosters development and reuse of models and simulations to support concept evaluation, requirement definition, test criteria derivation, test design and prediction, and operating performance and effectiveness analysis. JMASS is not a specific model, but rather an integrated set of software products consisting of interface standards, tools, and services that facilitate development for modeling, simulation, and analysis. Simulation composability (i.e. building targeted simulation systems out of reusable model components) is the next great advance in modeling and simulation.  Advances in software technologies (programming paradigms, languages, development tools, etc) are clearing the way for true simulation composability and will ultimately and significantly reduce cost and increase speed of delivery of modeling and simulation solutions.  As a simulation composability architecture, JMASS provides a stepping-stone toward achieving the broad vision of simulation composability. The JSB is: "A Joint Synthetic Battlespace providing better decisions and warfighting skills to build the world's most respected air and space forces for the Joint Force Commander." The Joint Synthetic Battlespace for the Air Force (JSB-AF) will provide realistic representations of friendly and threat warfighting capabilities, realistic representations of the natural environment where the warfighting capabilities exist, and an architecture framework to support developing representations that allow the easy and rapid integration of those representations into synthetic battlespaces. Additionally, it will provide a mechanism to capture and distribute information generated by the JSB-AF and its users to support training, mission rehearsal, decision support, acquisition, deployment, employment, operations, tactics/strategy development for deployment, Courses of Action (COA) analysis and development, security, and the sustainment of warfighting capabilities. The Joint Synthetic Battlespace (JSB) https://cx.hanscom.af.mil/JSB/ activity plans to leverage legacy simulations such as JMASS. The C2EI Office requests industry comments/opinions concerning the following: 1. Your corporate ability to support JMASS sustainment to begin Fall 2003. Your estimate of time required to become proficient on maintaining JMASS code. 2. Your technical approach to providing timely software maintenance to existing JMASS users. 3. Recommend preferable contract type and estimates for this software maintenance activity. 4. Your corporate understanding of existing JMASS users and potential JMASS applications. Are you a current JMASS user? 5. Suggestions on the future of JMASS. 6. Suggestions on JMASS ability to support JSB emerging requirements.       Please provide a synopsis, no more than 5 pages, that addresses items 1-6 above. Your response to this RFI is requested NLT 23 Jun 03, 12:00 PM (noon) EDT. Responders should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary or competition sensitive and should mark them accordingly.  All correspondence related to this matter should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to ESC/CXK, Attn: Ms Diane O'Neil, e-mail at diane.oneil@hanscom.af.mil, voice, 781-377-2388, fax 781-377- 4624, 15 Eglin Street, Building 1607, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2100.

<DESC>The Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) of NCI’s Division of Biology, has a continuing requirement for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of a number of different research compounds of interest to the carcinogenesis research community.  The compounds are to be prepared in exploratory syntheses on a small scale and then prepared in a production run to yield one to several grams of sufficiently pure material (generally 99+  percent).  Compounds are to be characterized by a meaningful combination of appropriate techniques including specific activity; melting points; ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectroscopy; and NMR or mass spectroscopy.  Major responsibilities are: (1) resynthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH derivatives by established procedures for the restocking of NCI’s Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository as necessary, and (2) development of synthesis of selected chemical carcinogens, chemopreventive agents and certain of their metabolites or derivatives.  Distribution to the research community will be handled by the repository contractor all labeled and unlabeled compounds.  Labeled compounds will be subdivided and shipped to designated recipients in the research community either directly by the synthesis contractor or through the repository contractor.  The contractors shall be required to provide analytical, handling, and storage data with all shipments.  A high degree of cooperation with NCI, the repository contractor, and other synthesis program contractors is necessary.  This is a recompetition of 4 expired contracts for similar work. RFP-N02-CB-37025 will issued on or about June 24, 2003.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/). The Government anticipates 3 contracts will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three years with incentive options for two additional years.  The NAICS Code is 54170.  No Collect Calls accepted.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is being re-issued due to a system error in the FedBizOpps regarding a notice that should have been posted on 6 Jun 03.  The following is the Presolicitation Notice, inclusive of the Modification which was posted on 9 Jun 03:

Description:
Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Force Combat Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Please note that Step One proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time 9 July 2003, at the offices of Jones Lang LaSalle.  Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Offutt AFB project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Offutt project.  In the second step, up to three qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.  The Offutt Project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,255 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,255 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,600 housing units (including the 32 historical units, if the option is exercised), primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Successful Offeror (SO).  The Government may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Offutt family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.jllpsc.com/.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for a qualified contractor to provide all labor, facilities, and equipment necessary for an off-site secure magnetic media vault facility for SSA's disaster recovery program for the agency's Headquarters complex located in Woodlawn (Baltimore County) Maryland area.  Magnetic tape media contains vital computer programs and data that are essential to the operation and support of SSA.  Offsite protective storage is required as a measure to preserve this vital data should a destructive event occur at the Agency's National Computer Center (NCC).  The location of the Contractor's vault facility must be within proximity of the Woodlawn complex that allows for: 1) transporting the magnetic tape media to and from SSA on a daily schedule; 2) same pickup/delivery day for the magnetic media removed from the SSA data center and received at the Contractor's vault facility; 3) recall of critical magnetic tape-based data to be completed within 2 hours from time of notification to the Contractor that the media is needed at the SSA data center; and 4) delivery of magnetic tape media from the contractor's facility to the SSA disaster recover facility in New Jersey for both planned and unplanned operations and return of the media to the SSA NCC . Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo complete background investigations.  SSA anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price contract with a base year and four (4) 1-year options, if exercised. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541519.  The small business size standard for the NAICS code is $21 million. This acquisition is being conducted under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 regarding the acquisition of commercial items and FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Solicitation number SSA-RFQ-02-0397 is scheduled for release on/about August 27, 2002 with responses due not later than September 11, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA is requesting proposals for socio-economic profiles of fishers and their communities in St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands. This procurement is for the National Marine Fisheries Service, located at Miami, FL.  BACKGROUND: The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA, particularly National Standard 8, NS 8), National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), and Executive Order (EO) 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) require that social impact analyses be conducted when federal agencies propose new regulations.  In turn, these analyses require the use of social and cultural baseline data for the various user groups in the fishery, including descriptions of the commercial, for-hire, recreational and subsistence fishing sectors. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the proposed work is two-fold. The first and overarching objective of the proposed work is to conduct community profiles to satisfy the legal requirements of the MSA particularly NS 8, NEPA and EO 12898 in the islands of St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands. A second objective is to conduct a socio-economic evaluation of the performance of the Marine Conservation District. Objective 1-Community profiles: The first objective is to conduct community profiles to satisfy the legal requirements of the MSA particularly NS 8, NEPA and EO 12898 in the islands of St. Thomas and St. John in the United States Virgin Islands. Key to the successful completion of this objective is the timely development of research protocols and survey instruments since Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance will be required for this project. Also, NMFS anticipates drawing on these protocols and survey instruments to collect social, cultural and economic data regularly. Long-term data collection programs will permit the creation of baselines to monitor changes in fishing communities and provide managers with a deeper understanding of social and economic implications of their decisions. In developing community profiles, socio-economic data should be collected on an island and community level, placing fisheries and communities within the local historical, cultural and economic context. Profiles will describe the different fishery sectors, their distribution and linkages. To satisfy NS 8 requirements, there is a need to identify the various degrees of dependence and engagement. NMFS social scientists have suggested a minimum set of variables that need to be collected to a) identify communities and b) determine their level of dependence and engagement (see, attached tables). Contractors will draw on these variables to describe all sectors related to fishing activities. These sectors include, but are not limited to, commercial harvesters, charter sport fishing, recreational and subsistence sectors. In addition, the contractor will describe fisher cooperatives, markets and market arrangements, support sector operations (e.g., marine industry operations, marinas, gear sale outlets, and other types of fishery support services), sport-fishing organizations and other related sectors such as diver operators. Social and cultural dependency and engagement should also be investigated based on people's connection to place both on land and sea. A resource utilization map by the various fishing sectors is a deliverable. To facilitate the study of distributional impacts of future regulatory actions on the various sectors, contractors should examine these potential impacts in using both geographic and non-geographic categorizations. Contractors will examine these communities geographically, preferably drawing on graphical representations (e.g., GIS or other mapping software) or narrative descriptions. Contractors should describe the spatial distribution of the various sectors across communities in terms of location of landing sites, docking facilities, fisher residency, location of market nodes, etc.  Where data permit (e.g., fishermen and trip landings records), contractors will also assign landings data to either residence or landing sites, as appropriate. When possible, socio-economic data should be displayed in GIS format to facilitate later spatial analysis. Additionally, contractors should conduct a non-place based socio-cultural profile. Contractors should examine socio-cultural differences across different fishery sectors. This type of information will be incorporated into the profiles to facilitate potential differential impact analysis by group or socio-cultural dimension. For example, if the Council is considering implementing a new closure, the proposed research should provide some guidance as to the expected socio-economic impacts on the various user groups.  Objective 2- Seasonal Closure Evaluation: The second objective of the proposed work is to conduct a socio-economic evaluation of the performance of the Marine Conservation District. The implementation of the MCD has likely had important economic, cultural and social consequences on many adjacent communities.  Monitoring these changes (in addition to documenting fishermen's perceptions) will provide for an improved understanding of the human dimensions of establishing closures and will also give managers an opportunity to address fishermen's concerns and improve the existing regulatory framework. The socio-economic evaluation should be done within the umbrella of the profiling framework described above. PROJECT COMPONENTS: Research Design and Methodology-This component will be an early product of the contracted work to ensure that: a) study objectives are addressed, b) appropriate field methods and protocols are selected, c) suitable data (and sampling size) are collected, and d) final document layout agreed upon. This component will be the focus of the kick-off meeting discussion and will be refined in follow up exchanges. Review of Existing Material-This literature review will compile the relevant existing information prior to fieldwork to maximize efficiency. An extensive review of the existing literature must be incorporated into the final report in an effort to contextualize findings. In addition, references should be documented in End Note for future identification and cataloging purposes. Quantitative Fishery Data Analysis-To use fieldwork time more efficiently, contractors will be required to generate a database that has: trip landings information, fishermen census data, US Census data and permit data prior to the beginning their fieldwork. This database must be in Excel, Dbase or SAS format. Also, the contractor will be required to develop a series of maps that identify potential fishing communities by plotting the location of the permit holder residences, landings sites, fisher cooperatives, processing plants, etc. Contractors will also develop maps that show direct linkages between harvest areas and local communities. These tasks will require close cooperation with NMFS and USVI's Division of Fish and Wildlife (USVI DFW) staff. Survey instrument development-As noted in the project objectives and design section, the development of research protocols and survey instruments is an important component of the proposed work since OMB clearance is required. Also, NMFS anticipates that this type of socio-economic information will be collected regularly, which will permit the examination of socio-economic trends. The timely completion of this component will ensure that the structure of the study and outputs satisfy NMFS needs and are consistent with other research efforts in the area.  This will be a collaborative effort between the contractor and NMFS staff. OMB Submission- After finalizing the survey instrument, the contractor will be responsible for writing sections of the justification statement for OMB. In particular, the need for collecting certain types of qualitative and quantitative data and the means by which these data will be collected and analyzed. The total amount of writing involved for this component will be in the order of 7-10 pages. This component will be a collaborative effort between the contractor and NMFS staff. Fieldwork-After compiling a list of potential communities and landing sites and obtaining the appropriate OMB clearance, contractors will conduct fieldwork in two phases. The timing of each phase will be determined by the contractor in consultation with NMFS staff. In one phase of the research process, contractors will conduct ethnographic fieldwork to obtain a broad description of the communities, sector linkages, characterize the nature and degree of their involvement in fishing and fishery-related activities. Rapid assessment techniques should be used to ground-truth the identified communities. In another phase, contractors will conduct a standardized survey aimed at collecting socio-economic data to satisfy to minimum NS 8 data requirements. Both phases of the fieldwork should collect information to meet objective 2. Prior to conducting the survey, the contractor should provide copies of the OMB-approved survey instrument(s) interview guide(s) and should pre-test the survey to ensure the soundness of the instrument Report writing and production-Contractors shall prepare a draft and final report.  The draft report will be complete, and it is intended that the final report will require only minor changes in response to reviewer comments. The research should also identify data deficiencies and suggest future research needs. Close communication between the contractor and NMFS staff is expected over the course of the project to ensure a high quality and timely product. CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: First-hand knowledge of and demonstrated familiarity with fisheries, fishery sectors (i.e., commercial, recreational and subsistence) and communities in the Caribbean. Demonstrated familiarity with theoretical and/or empirical literature regarding sociological and anthropological research on fishing communities. Previous sociological/anthropological research experience in identifying and/or profiling fishing communities. Previous sociological/anthropological research experience regarding fisheries in the Caribbean, preferably in the United States Virgin Islands. Demonstrated ability to deliver high quality work in a timely fashion. Demonstrated familiarity with various legal mandates and agency guidelines that frame NMFS' social regulatory impact analyses (e.g., Magnuson-Stevens/Sustainable Fisheries Acts, EO 12898, NEPA, Guidelines for Social Impact Analyses, etc.). Detailed working plan, describing time and resource allocation for the various tasks. This is an important consideration given that prior to conducting any fieldwork contractors will need to secure OMB clearance. Experience in a) accessing and using Census data to identify and/or profile communities, b) using GIS and/or other graphical software to provide research results in mapping format, and c) using anthropological softwares such as Atlas.ti. Offerors shall prepare their proposals to address the above factors in the order listed.  When selecting an offer for award, the Government will consider the technical ratings coupled with the proposed cost.  The Government will base its award on the overall proposal that provides the best value in terms of technical merit and price.  As technical merit becomes more equal between offers, price becomes significantly more important.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without holding discussions with the offerors. The solicitation will be available on or about July 9, 2003.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation should send a written request to the contracting officer, referencing this announcement number.  Requests may be made by fax (816) 426-7530) or e-mail.  This action is set-aside for small business.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics intends to enter into a contract for research services to develop guidelines for pricing International services.  Total cost for this requirement is NTE $12,000.00.  

This project requires experience and knowledge in tracking and valuing International services, as well as experience in using International Price Program (IPP) price data.  Data are not available from public sector sources.  

DESCRIPTION:    

I.	Objectives:  

The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility and utility of constructing additional price indexes that would cover U.S. imports and exports of services. This research should also attempt to assess and prioritize any future work (i.e. which product areas should be attempted first and which should be given a lesser priority.)  The resulting report is not expected to discuss the methodology necessary to produce any new indexes.  

II.	Description and Scope of Work:  

In order to ensure the project will be of practical use to the Bureau, contractor shall be expected to confer with the Branch Chief for Index Methods, Analysis, and Evaluations, of the Bureau’s Division of International Prices.  In addition, all plans, milestones, proposals and documents shall be approved by the Branch Chief.  The Branch Chief or his designee shall be responsible for ensuring that the researcher’s requests for information covering IPP methodology and procedures will be handled as quickly as is reasonably possible.  

This contract shall result in a document that attempts to answer the question, “What International services should the BLS consider in-scope of its IPP survey?”  

The project shall require the contractor to:  

(1)	Review the basic concepts and the associated methodology of the export and import price indexes.  
(2)	Review the theoretical and conceptual body of work associated with pricing and valuation of International services.  
(3)	Review the uses of price indexes in general and International price indexes in particular.  This shall include developing a full understanding of the conceptual differences between International price indexes and producer price indexes.  
(4)	Assess some of the recent trends in International services, such as overseas outsourcing of software development and telephone call centers.  
(5)	Develop a document making appropriate recommendations for BLS regarding the feasibility and utility of producing any future price indexes covering International services.  

This project requires an expert to investigate both the current and future uses and utility of measuring International prices in this component of the global economy.  This is an increasingly complex and difficult area to measure as it includes such new services as e-commerce, offshore phone centers, software development, etc.)  This project requires someone who has experience and knowledge in tracking and valuing International services, as well as someone with experience in using IPP price data.  

The research will be carried out over a four month period, June 13, 2003 to October 15, 2003.  

The proposal shall cover all related expenses including training and travel expenses.  

The contractor shall adhere to the Bureau’s confidentiality and security requirements.  

III.	Inspection and Acceptance:  

Final inspection and acceptance of the research paper called for in the project will be made by designated staff of the Office of Prices and Living Conditions.  

IV.	Deliverables:  

The provider shall submit the following items to the Division of International Prices by the dates indicated:  

  1.  Proposal Outline (by June 30, 2003)  

  2.  First Draft of Research Paper (by September 1, 2003)  

  3.  Final Draft of Research Paper (by October 15, 2003)  

All interested parties may express their interest to the Point of Contact (designated below) by the due date of this notice, either by e-mail or facsimile on 202-691-6026.  Correspondence must reference the number for this posting.  Affirmative written responses must be received by the due date.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

In order to assist its disaster support mission, Federal Emergency Management Agency* (FEMA) agents in a number of dedicated response centers receive calls on a general 800 number from the disaster stricken public.  The agent takes information from the disaster victim, then transcribes the information required to apply for disaster assistance.  If an agent services a caller who speaks a language that the agent is not directly capable of understanding, the agent must have immediate access to an interpretation support service.  The FEMA agent can then establish a three-way conference, including a representative from the support service able to interactively translate the conversation.   One of the most specialized and high priority aspects of this requirement is the ability to handle calls made by the linguistically diverse residents and potential disaster victims of the United States and its territories.  Since the birth of FEMA’s 800-disaster response system, the agency has encountered more than 83 languages (Appendix A of the Performance Work Statement).  

FEMA must have a reliable source of contract language services support.  The historical usage patterns of FEMA disaster relief hotlines (Appendix B of the Performance Work Statement) are subject to both high volumes and extreme fluctuations.  The contractor providing translation support must be capable of providing service subject to these demands on a continuous twenty-four hour a day basis.  The successful contractor shall have the capability to handle a minimum of 700 calls per day.

Offerors shall submit pricing on a per minute basis.  For a useful method of comparison, 545,000-minutes per year will be used in the price analysis of proposals received.  This is only an estimate – it is not a guarantee that this many minutes per year will actually be required.  The minimum guarantee for this contract is 30,000 minutes.  The maximum for this contract is 4,500,000 minutes.

Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

<DESC>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LN), plans to procure an XR 100 CCD Camera 2600 Line Bottom Mounted Extra Sharp, Large Pixel Cooled  CCD Camera with Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation, 3 Electronics Avenue, Danvers, MA  01923.  The services and supplies herein are being procured using the simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 423450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Laboratory of Neurobiology engages in fundamental research on the structural basis of synaptic transmission, New advances make it possible to apply tomography to understand the structure of the post synaptic apparatus.  The purchase of a specialized digital camera is needed to collect and analyze images generated by a JEOL electron microscope for tomography of the post-synaptic apparatus.  A new technique of tomography applies a mathematical algorithm to analyze multiple (50 or more) images of the same part of the section taken at a series of angles, thereby producing images at the molecular level.  In order to photograph these series a high resolution digital camera needs to be incorporated directly into the electron microscope, and the camera must be connected to a computer that can direct the taking of the images as well as their storage and preliminary analysis.  The digital camera offered by AMT is specifically designed for collecting multiple images in the electron microscope.  AMT offers a camera specifically designed to work with a, (previously purchased by NINDS) JEOL 100 CX and 200 CX interchangeably.  Images collected in the computer running the camera can be directly saved at full resolution and gray scale in TIFF format directly legible in Photoshop running on Apple computers, and the information content of these images will be at least 2600X2600 pixels at 16 bits (>7 MB image).  A 61x62m phosphor detector will give a field of view at least 70% the size of that with 3 1/4" film, and the sensitivity of the camera will be measurably better than standard Kodak EM film.   Images will be magnified no more than 2X onto the surface of the phosphor which collects the image. These camera specifications are all necessary to optimize the collection of EM images over the most commonly used magnification range of the microscope.  Camera can be switched easily from one microscope to another by the operator.  In the past contamination of the camera chip by vacuum oils has been a problem.  AMT has designed a camera that, except for the collecting phosphor, lies completely outside the vacuum system.  The camera will have a fast scan mode needed to focus quickly on the specimen before images are collected.   The camera chip is air cooled so no water connections are necessary.  Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corporation is the only source known to the NINDS that can provide the aforementioned CCD Camera with the specifications required.
The AMT camera is a general use camera system designed and tested for collecting images in JEOL 100-CX or 200-CX electron microscopes, previously purchase and in currently in use by the NINDS researchers. However, this camera represents striking new advances in the state of the art which make it uniquely suited to the needs of our program.   Delivery and installation must be on or before July 1. 2003.   This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, especially with regard to compatibility, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM, EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 13, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 513390 This amendmend provides additional clarification to questions about the statement of work.   Please contact Ed Brosnan at brosnan.edward@epa.gov if have any questions. The following are additional clarification's to RFQ-DC-03-00237, the due date for quotes remains  unchanged. Question # 1a)  What is the program format and content?  I would like a rundown of the envisioned program from opening title to what is produced at the Beaufort site, to the content of the segments from the remote sites.  Answer to #1a:  Please go to the website:  www.estuarylive.org  to see the schedule for 2003 and to view the 2002 EstuaryLive program to get an idea of what is involved with producing an EstuaryLive program. The specifics for EstuaryLive 2003 are in the process of being determined by each live site.   Question # 1b)  Do each of these sites have a host  on-camera that walks us through the "highlights" of that site? In other words, what is the content of the program at each site?   Answer to #1b:  Each site will have an on-camera host that serves as a tour guide for their program.  As previously stated, at this time we have not determined the  content of each site's program for 2003. Question #2) Are the "trained naturalists" at a computer taking and answering questions? Answer to #2)  The "trained naturalists" and other experts provided by the live sites are supported by a colleague who is at a computer receiving questions by email  and deciding which questions to pass along to the experts to answer.  The questions are passed along to the experts via a headset system.  The experts answer the questions live on air verbally during the live tour. Question #3) Under production staff, do we need a director from our end? Answer  #3) A Director is needed to coordinate the production and the placement of vendor produced chyrons. Question #4) What is the role of the "Program Producer" mentioned in the RFP? Answer #4) The program producer is responsible for all communication with Reserve and NEP sites and their production  crews as well as the downlinks, addition of chyrons, and subsequent uplink. Question #5) What is meant by fully weatherproofing equipment for use in a "hostile marine environment"?  We need to know specifically what conditions are meant by this. Answer #5) These are harsh, wet and windy,  saltspray filled environments.  The production needs to continue no matter the weather at the host site. Question #6) What about a web host and creation of the interactive component on the web? We assume that there is no interactivity from the live program to the web audience, since we have not  been asked to provide any part of the webcast component. They mention as much as 8 live satellite uplinks and downlinks over a 1-2 day period. We basically create a TV show that is provided off satellite as a live webcast and they conduct the interactive component. I understand that questions being  asked and answered through a "trained naturalist" at a computer. We assume that there is no interactivity with the on-camera host answering questions of any kind.  He/she is just hosting,correct? Answer #6)  The webcast component of EstuaryLive 2003 will be provided under a separate contract for  streaming services. Question #7)  Do the remotes need to be up all the time? Answer #7)  No, but they must be up in sufficient time to establish good connections and allow for last minute changes. This is a two-day program over which each live site has its own hour-long segment.  Notice that the  2003 EstuaryLive schedule has been posted on the following website: http://www.estuarylive.org/schedules.htm Please note that the schedule is still subject to change and that schedule references to EstuaryLive programming on September 23&24 are not part of the Satellite Production contract. The  date for Quotes remains the same, due by noon, June 19, 2003.

<SUBJECT>58--SCA-compliant MILSATCOM terminal equipment and components that will operate at frequencies above 2 GHz.
<SOLNBR>DAAB0703RF299
<RESPDATE>071403
<ARCHDATE>09122003
<CONTACT>Brett  Boyle, 732-427-1670
<DESC>NA The Government seeks information from contractors familiar with the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Software Communications Architecture (SCA) related to ongoing industry efforts to develop SCA-compliant MILSATCOM terminal equipment and components that will operate at frequencies above 2 GHz.  CECOM/PM-WINT is currently studying the impact of imposing a requirement for future MILSATCOM terminals operating in this frequency range to be SCA-compliant.  To this end, CECOM/PM-WINT seeks information from indu stry addressing the following questions: 1.	Do you currently have SCA-compliant MILSATCOM equipment, components and/or waveforms (which includes the physical layer, link layer, intra-networking, as well as internetworking) available? If so: (1) Describe the process by which you have determined SC A compliance, (2) Describe the operational characteristics of the SCA-compliant equipment, components and/or waveforms (e.g., type of equipment, operating frequency range, supportable data rates, physical layer, link layer, networking, etc.), (3) Describe any limitations and/or benefits youÃ¢Â€Â™ve observed in developing SCA-compliant equipment, components and/or waveforms, (4) Describe the cost impact, if any, that you have observed in meeting SCA-compliance for the particular equipment, components and/or waveforms (5) Identify those portions of the design that are company proprietary as well as any associated limitations for Government use. 2.	Do you have plans for developing SCA-compliant MILSATCOM equipment, components and/or waveforms?  If so: (1) Provide a schedule identifying when the SCA-compliant MILSATCOM equipment, components and/or waveforms will be available, (2) Describe the proce ss that you will apply in determining SCA compliance, (3) Describe the operational characteristics of the SCA-compliant equipment, components and/or waveforms to be developed (e.g., type of equipment, operating frequency range, supportable data rates, etc. ), (4) Describe the cost impact, if any, that you anticipate in meeting SCA-compliance for the particular equipment, components and/or waveforms, (5) Identify those portions of the design that you anticipate will be company proprietary as well as the assoc iated limitations for Government Use. 3.	What do you think it would take to develop an SCA-compliant MILSATCOM networked waveform with the following features: (a) operation at Ka-band and/or EHF (Transitional Communications System [TCS] based satellite infrastructure), (b) support for networks  of up to 100 terminals communicating on-the-move with dynamic on-demand access to shared satellite resources, and (c) integration with the JTRS Network Control layer for Internetworking with other JTRS channels.  Responses should  (1) Provide a schedule i dentifying when the SCA-compliant MILSATCOM waveform could be available, (2) Identify the cost involved in developing and testing the SCA-compliant MILSATCOM waveform, (3) Describe the process that you will apply in determining SCA compliance, (4) Describe  the operational characteristics of the SCA-compliant waveforms (e.g., type of equipment required, operating frequency range, supportable data rates, etc.), (5) Identify those portions of the design that you anticipate will be company proprietary as well a s the associated limitations for Government Use.   4.	What extensions, if any, will be required to the current SCA to address requirements that may be unique for MILSATCOM equipment?  5.	The government is contemplating multi-frequency capability in future MILSATCOM terminals.   Will the adoption of SCA facilitate the construction of terminals with these characteristics?  What advantages will adoption of the SCA for these terminal types afford the government? 6.	In context of the characteristics of AEHF waveform processing, what benefit will SCA provide?  How much work around, if any for SCA will be required to build a AEHF terminal today?  In two years? 7.	It is envisioned th at networking (can draw parallels to the JTRS WNW) will be incorporated in future MILSATCOM terminals and waveforms.  Does the SCA facilitate the adoption of networking waveforms into MILSATCOM terminals? Both contractors and sub-contractors are invited to respond. The intent of this RFI is to gather information in order to assess the current state of technology, identify technology trends, and learn of industry intentions, in support of the CECOM/PM-WINT s tudy. This RFI is not a request for proposals. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it.
