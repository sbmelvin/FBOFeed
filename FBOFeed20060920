<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Conservation Training Center intends to sole source award to American Standard, Inc. to refurbish 74 bathtubs in the Murie Lodge that were installed in 2003.  The bathtubs were manufactured by American Standard, Inc. and were determined to have a defective porcelain finish and water has caused the steel bases to rust over the past few years.  Since the work is considered as warranty, the government must contract directly with American Standard, Inc directly to fund half of the cost for refurbishment in order for American Standard's offer to be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy, intends to award a sole source contract utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Systems Design Group for software maintenance for the cadet modules. This is a sole source acquisition approved in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  
Systems Design Group is the only source capable of fulfilling the Government's requirement.  Systems Design Group has proprietary rights to the software, and no other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, interested companies who feel they meet the requirements identified must submit a detailed capability package by the date and time identified herein for consideration. If no response is received by 30 Sep 2006, 12:00PM Noon, MDT, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining supplies and/or services through a sole source procurement with Systems Design Group, a sole source award will be made.

<CONTACT>Michael Smith Michael.Smith@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is a net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system (WS), capable of tasking ISR sensors and receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data/information from airborne, national, and commercial reconnaissance platforms and sensors such as the U-2, Global Hawk, and Predator. AF DCGS performs global multi-INT operations and correlates collected Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). This WS consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission-partner sites interconnected by the Global Information Grid (GIG). AF DCGS Increment 2 is the next major acquisition activity building upon the architectural framework established by AF DCGS Block 10.2. Increment 2 will modernize Signals Intelligence capabilities, integrating it into AF DCGS net-centric environment as well as provide new and enhanced capabilities and continuing IMINT and MASINT updates. AF DCGS WS capabilities will be expanded to handle an increased number of existing, upgraded, and new sensors with improved communications and processing/ exploitation timelines. Current planning is for these capabilities to be developed and fielded through several versions, with each version providing a capability that is affordable, militarily useful, and based on a mature technology. Delivery of Increment capabilities will be primarily based on user priorities and the availability of mature technologies. Please check back on HERBB for future updates and more information when it becomes available. Additionally, please hold all questions until such updates have been posted.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220.  The size standard is $31 million per year.  This is a HUBZone set-aside procurement.  HUBZone firms shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head.  This letter shall include a statement of interest, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference and a signed Document Security Certification (uploaded on FedBizOpps) with a copy of a valid business license.  Letters and certification are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than October 5, 2006.  Send documentation to the attention of Diane Henderson, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), (7PMA), Room 12B01, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102 or dianna.henderson@gsa.gov.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $10,000,000 to $20,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about October 5, 2006 via FedTeds (https://www.fedteds.gov/).  Firms must send the letter of intent with the security certification to gain access to the documents.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held October 18, 2006 in El Paso, Texas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the project, specifications, drawings and technical evaluation criteria.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.  GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with the construction contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project.  The scope of this project includes but is not limited to the construction to expand the port of entry from 160,766 rentable square feet (rsf) to 193,076 rsf.  The project proposes increases in the pedestrian and vehicle primary area, the import lot area, and additional site security and parking.  The facility will provide a total of 201,093 gross square feet and 412 outside parking spaces to meet the projected increases over the next 10 years in pedestrian and vehicular traffic at the port of entry.  The project is designed to comply with a Certification Level according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED), Rating System.  The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials, equipment and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract.  The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price.  The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission at no recompense to the offeror(s).  The technical factors are tentatively as follows: (#1) Past Performance on Similar Projects; (#2) Experience on Similar Projects; (#3) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel; and (#4) Detailed Management Plan and Technical Approach.  Proposals will be due on or about November 9, 2006.  All questions/clarifications regarding the project documents (drawings, specifications, procedures, etc.) shall be put in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than close of business October 30, 2006.  Production costs and proposal preparation costs are at the expense of the offeror.  All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-06-HHC-0130.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation to acquire Employee Assistance services for employees of NGA.  All contractor personnel shall have a Top Secret Clearance/Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access.  The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and will include a base year plus four (4) one-year option periods. The period of performance will be from date of contract award (estimated to be March 2006) through March 2011, including options.   This acquisition will be solicitated and awarded utilizing FAR subpart 12, Commercial Acquisitions, procedures.  The NGA Human Development Directorate (HD) has a requirement for Employee Assistance services to support the needs of NGA employees and their family members. NGA provides employees and family members with Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services such as counseling on relationships, stress management, balancing work/life issues, substance abuse, depression & anxiety, grief/loss counseling, chronic medical and physical problems, and parenting concerns.  Additionally, referral services are provided for child & elder care, legal and financial needs.  This requirement is a 100 % small business set-aside. The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code is 624190, size standard is $6,000,000.  Proposals received from other than small business concerns will not be accepted.  The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.  Techniques utilizing past performance information and price will be evaluated; therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offeror. Solicitation HM1576-06-R-0007 is scheduled for release on or about 25 January 2006, with a closing date of 24 February 2006. No telephone, fax, email or mailed requests for the RFP will be honored. The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS), website at https://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, whether before or after RFP closing, with no obligations. Proposal preparation cost will be borne by offerors submitting proposals in response to the solicitation. Solicitation will include Statement of Work (SOW).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The USGPO e-IDentification program will provide smart card identification credentials under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) in addition to smart cards for other current and future Federal Government initiatives and programs for agencies and organizations throughout all three Branches of the Federal Government.   The goals of the USGPO are to provide a trusted, secure supply chain for the procurement and maintenance of electronic components and software, to enhance the overall security of government identification credentials, and to utilize the core competencies and internal capabilities of the USGPO where appropriate for security reasons or where efficiencies can be achieved.  The USGPO intends to achieve these goals using an established model of Public and Private cooperation.

Responses are limited to vendors with existing capabilities to meet the requirements stated in the Statement of Objectives.

This is a Request for Information/Sources Sought notice only.     This is not a Request for Proposals and in no way commits the Government to establish a procurement vehicle. The Government does not intend to establish a procurement vehicle solely on submissions to this Request for Information/Sources Sought notice, nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this notice.

Industry comments are to be sent electronically via email to Herbert H. Jackson, Jr., Contracting Officer, at hjackson@gpo.gov.   The comment period for this draft RFP closes Friday, July 14, 2006 at 3:00pm

However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

This requirement is restricted for set-aside as a national 8(a) competitive acquisition.  

The solicitation for the Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB) SABER contract will be released soon.  It is tentatively scheduled for release on or about 31 May 06.

<CONTACT>Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.501(a)(1) and 13.106-1(b)(2), services from the USC Obstetricians and GYN, 1640 Marengo Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033 to measure sex hormones on stored serum samples collected from postmenopausal women, currently participating in the Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (WLM), an existing multi-center National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded study. 

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 with the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.5.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requisition is to provide analysis of 1,060 patient serum samples from participants of the Weight Loss Maintenance Trial (WML) already collected, to measure sex hormones, for example, estrone, total and free estradiol, total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, and sex hormone binding globulin.   These participants are postmenopausal women who are not taking hormone replacement.  The analysis of the serum samples for this contract is ancillary to the WLM.  Period of performance shall be for one year from date of award.  


USC shall measure Estrone (E1), total and free estradiol (E2), total and free testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), DHEA-S, and SHBG on the stored samples: WLM baseline and randomization.  Serum levels of A, T, E1 and E2 will be measured using radioimmunoassays (RIAs) {Lobo, 1981; Goebelsmann, 1973; Goebelsmann, 1979}.  Prior to RIA, steroids will be extracted from serum with hexane:ethyl acetate. A and T shall be separated by Celite column partition chromatography using increasing concentrations of toluene in trimethylpentane. E1 and E2 shall be separated in a similar fashion by use of ethyl acetate in trimethylpentane. Free T is calculated using total T and SHBG concentrations, and an assumed constant for albumin in a validated algorithm {Sodergard, 1982;Vermeulen, 1999 }.  Free E2 is calculated in a similar manner.  DHEAS will be measured by a direct competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay, and SHBG and FSH are measured by direct chemiluminescent immunometric assay on the Immulite analyzer (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Inglewood, CA).  
 
All analysis must be performed by one laboratory, in order to maintain consistency of data and mitigate contamination of samples. USC Obstetricians and GYN is the only source known to the NCI that can measure all serum analytes in the same laboratory (multiple laboratories would be required to measure all analytes) to achieve uninterrupted research data for the Weight Loss Maintenance Trail (WLM).  It is also necessary that these results be comparable with the measurement of sex hormones provided by USC Obstetricians and GYN, in previous breast cancer studies (separate contract).    

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 25, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-60189-NG.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Amendment 1: The purpose of this Amendment 1 is to answer questions from vendors in regards to the RFQ and to extend the quotation due date.  The following set of questions were submitted by vendors and answered by the end user. 1) They mention two automated valves.  I  assume they want the two mentioned right before it as the ones they want automated.  Or are these  additional valves? 2) They mention an interface of a GSV or LSV to the S/SI inlet.  Do they just want the plumbing or are they asking for these valves as well. 3) They say substitute Hastalloy-C  Valve. For which valve is this to be  substituted? 4) Where would one get a Microfluids Dean Switch?  We don't make them.  We provide everything else you have asked for and we can get this as well, if we know where. The response to the 4 questions above is:  The instrument should have a cryogenic  oven that is able to separate N2 from O2 using one column.  The instrument should also have the valving/plumbing to be able to separate these two gases using two columns in a row. Clarification on Instrument:  Instrument needed is a GC/TCD/FID that will be used to analyze landfill gas.   The  quotation due date has been extended to 4:00 PM Friday, September 22, 2006.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-Aircrew-Helmet-Noise-Reduction-(AHNR)
<CONTACT>Carol Estes, Contracting Officer, Phone 210-536-2068, Fax 210-536-4563, Email carol.estes@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for an Aircrew Helmet Noise Reduction (AHNR) system designed to integrate with the HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P flight helmets.  Responses to this RFI are due no later than 29 Sept 2006.

1.0 DESCRIPTION:  The 648 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS), is seeking feedback on the draft performance specification for AHNR. The AHNR is an integrated helmet noise reduction system, which will effectively reduce noise in all phases of flight in multiple platforms and crew positions which require use of the Air Force HGU-55/P and HGU-56/P helmets.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

- Feasibility assessment and comment on Draft Performance Specification
- Approximate cost information (i.e. order of magnitude, ballpark estimate, etc.) for development and testing efforts needed to meet Draft Performance Specification requirements
- Schedule estimates (development, test, and production capacities)
- Comments on additional technical questions contained in section 3.0 of this RFI
- Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing the AHNR system

2.0 PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to open a dialogue with industry and other communities of interest, to ensure to the maximum extent possible that industry input and comments are given proper and due consideration in development of the Air Force AHNR.  The RFI is also expected to help 648 AESS/TA to complete indicative costing of the AHNR solution.

This RFI is for planning purposes only, and there is no intention to award any contract based on this RFI.  The Government will not compensate any interested party, firm, or individual that may choose to provide a response to this RFI.  An appropriate Request for Proposal (RFP) process may follow at the appropriate time, but is not necessarily linked directly to the questions and responses generated in this RFI.

3.0 CAPABILITIES SOUGHT

The topics for responses set out the information on concepts and designs that 648 AESS/TA is seeking in relation to the AHNR approach and scope of this RFI.  Generated requirements are listed in the referenced Draft Performance Specification document.  Note that these requirements are in Draft only; these capabilities are not necessarily guaranteed to be required in the final Performance Specification.

This section lists additional Government questions/comments on capabilities found in the Draft Performance Specification, or related questions to the AHNR program.  Industry should address the feasibility of the requirements in the Draft Performance Specification, answer questions about the specific requirements called out below, as well as respond to the informational questions with comments and potential solutions.

Please address the requirements of section 3 in the Draft Performance Specification from a feasibility standpoint.  Are these requirements able to be met with current technology, or would there have to be a significant development effort for some of the features we are seeking?  If there are major development efforts, please note these and give approximate costs and schedules to achieve this development.

How would you measure bulk for this system?  What would be a realistic number for total system weight and head supported weight?  What would you suggest the testing matrix in section 4 look like, and when should these tests be preformed (FAT, Production Lot, etc.)?  What quantities are realistic when it comes to lot testing this type of item?  Would this add significant costs and testing to the development of the AHNR?

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those capabilities specified in the referenced Draft Performance Specification.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0 RESPONSE GUIDANCE

Respondents to this RFI should submit documents via email to both of the POCs listed in section 7.0 of this RFI.  In the response, please reference specific sections in the Draft Performance Specification by number, with the comments and evaluation of that particular section following.  In addition, please address the questions outside of the Draft Performance Specification in section 3.0 of this RFI, and provide responses following the analysis of the Draft Performance Specification.  Submitted responses should be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format.

5.0 INFORMATION APPROACH

When the responses to this RFI are received, they will be evaluated and analyzed by the Government.  The information received will be considered in the development of the next proposed design, and may serve as input to a business case.

Based on industry responses, 648 AESS/TA intends to modify/update the Performance Specification document as necessary.  In all cases pertaining to this RFI, the Government will take absolute care not to present information outside of the Government in a way that clearly identifies individual vendors or products.

6.0 DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.210 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

7.0 CONTACT INFORMATION

Responses should include the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with us.

The following are the government Point of Contacts (POCs) for this RFI:

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government's Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies, ?and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.  

2.2	E-Authentication Federation
In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation. 
? Capability to provide technical interface with the E-Authentication technical architecture in adopted standard(s), using approved technology products(s).
? Capability to meet the requirements to become a participating member of the E-Authentication Federation.
? Capability to provide physical and logical security for the services provided and for protection of personal and private information related to the public as required by law.

4.0	Architectural Descriptions
Respondents are requested to provide brief architectural descriptions of the identity credential service they provide, including reliability, availability, and scalability characteristics to meet the functional requirements specified in Section 3.0.  If the vendor provides more than one architectural option, then brief descriptions per architecture may be provided.  Descriptions should be no more than five (5) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to the feasibility and design tradeoffs/implications, if any, in order to meet the functional requirements listed in section 3.0.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

Respondents are requested to identify and provide information related to implementation schedule considerations for each architecture.  This information should be no more than two (2) pages per architecture.

5.0	Cost Information

In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation.

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government?s Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies,? and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.

2.0	Description
The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) announcement is to obtain information on capabilities currently available in the marketplace, based on the requirements outlined, from all interested parties.  Responses to this RFI will assist the Government in determining acquisition strategies. 

2.1	Purpose
The General Services Administration (GSA) is requesting information on the capability of commercial and other entities to provide identity credential services to support public access to Internet-based online government services.  The identity credentials will meet the requirements of the Federal Government?s Assurance Level 1 and Level 2 standards, as defined in Office of Management Budget (OMB) M-04-04 ?E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies,? and as measured in accordance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63 ?Electronic Authentication Guideline:  Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology,? and the E-Authentication Credential Assessment Framework.?  (See http://www.cio.gov/eauthentication)

GSA is seeking information from multiple categories of identity credential services:  
? Commercial entities for which issuance of identity credentials is currently a supporting activity to enable their customers to gain access and to conduct business with them online. Information is sought about their capabilities and desire to extend the use of those credentials to access Federal Government online services as a value-added capability to their customers. Examples of this category include, but are not limited to banking and financial services, health care services, or insurance services.

? Government and non-government entities that currently issue identity credentials as a supporting activity to enable the public to gain access and to conduct business online.  Information is sought about their capabilities to extend the use of those credentials for access to Government online services as a value-added capability to their existing customers.  Examples of this category include, but are not limited to Federal, State and local governments, educational institutions, associations, and other federations and partnerships. 

? Commercial entities for whom issuance and maintenance of identity credentials is currently a line of business. Information is sought on their capability to provide vendor-owned and managed services to issue compliant identity credentials to the public, manage the credentials throughout the entire lifecycle (i.e., issuance, validation, revocation, renewal), and provide status and other information about the credential when requested by the Federal Government online services.  

2.2	E-Authentication Federation
In 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated GSA as the lead agency for the E-Authentication Initiative, a cross-cutting initiative of the E-Government component of the President?s Management Agenda.  The E-Authentication Initiative was charged with developing a means of defining the levels of risk associated with online transactions performed between the public and government or between government entities, and to make available a set of common solutions to mitigate that risk.

With the approval of its Executive Steering Committee, a governance body comprised of representatives of the 24 CIO Council agencies, the E-Authentication Initiative elected to pursue a federated approach to identity management to provide a standardized, government-wide means of authenticating users of online government services, thereby reducing the risk of E-Government.  The result was the creation of the E-Authentication Federation, a public-private partnership that enables citizens, businesses and government employees to securely access online government services using log-in IDs issued by trusted third-parties, both within and outside the government.

Government agencies may E-Authentication-enable any Internet-based system that has end users outside the agency?s firewall and requires identity verification of those users.  Once an agency?s system has been E-Authentication-enabled, it becomes a ?relying party,? able to grant access to end users who have an identity credential from one or more of the E-Authentication Federation credential service providers (CSPs).  If end users do not already have a credential from an approved CSP, they may obtain at no cost an approved credential that will be usable to gain access to multiple Federation-member services.

The E-Authentication technical architecture provides the operational infrastructure of the E-Authentication Federation.  The E-Authentication technical architecture is the approved authentication service component of the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) and, as such, is the recommended technical approach for online user authentication for Federal agencies.

As of August 2006, the E-Authentication Federation consists of 13 unique relying parties representing various Federal agencies, and 5 approved credential service providers, which issue and validate the identity credentials that constituents may use to gain access to those services.  The E-Authentication program expects the Federation to expand to an estimated 450+ on-line services by the end of FY11.

2.3	Credential Service Provider Membership
Membership as an E-Authentication Federation Credential Service Provider (CSP) is dependent upon meeting the following requirements:  

? Completion of an Application for assessment
? Provision of an assessment package to the E-Authentication Program Management Office (PMO)
? Undergo credential assessment by E-Authentication PMO
? Submission of attestation documentation 
? Undergo acceptance testing with the E-Authentication Interoperability Laboratory
? Demonstrate operational readiness, including implementation of E-Governance PKI Certificate and exchange of metadata within the Federation 
? Execution of a Credential Service Provider Agreement 

The specific detailed requirements can be found at http://www.gio.gov/eauthentication.

3.0	Functional Requirements
Respondents are requested to provide information in response to the following functional requirements:

? Capability to issue credentials to the public in a manner compliant with requirements specified in NIST SP 800-63 for assurance levels 1 and 2 (i.e., USERID/PIN and/or USERID/Password).
? Compliance with the requirements specified in the ?Password Credential Assessment Profile v2.0.?
? Capability to provide online registration and credential maintenance (i.e., information updates, resets, termination) in a manner compliant with NIST SP 800-63.
? Capability to provide customer support services, including 24x7 help desk services.
? Capability to complete registration and issuance of the identity credentials in a single online session.
? Capability to provide a scalable architecture to support the interface to additional online services as they join the Federation. 
? Capability to provide technical interface with the E-Authentication technical architecture in adopted standard(s), using approved technology products(s).
? Capability to meet the requirements to become a participating member of the E-Authentication Federation.
? Capability to provide physical and logical security for the services provided and for protection of personal and private information related to the public as required by law.

4.0	Architectural Descriptions
Respondents are requested to provide brief architectural descriptions of the identity credential service they provide, including reliability, availability, and scalability characteristics to meet the functional requirements specified in Section 3.0.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Hubzone Business Concerns The USGS has a requirement for janitorial services at the National Wetlands Research Center in Lafayette, Louisiana.  The contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, documentation and other requirements necessary to provide janitorial services unless otherwise specified.   Interested Hubzone concerns need to respond to this inquiry by September 25, 2006 at 4:00pm MST with the requested information as stated below.  Fax the information to (303) 236-2710.  Telephone calls will not be considered.  The information provided will be used to determine if the requirement should be set-aside for Hubzone concerns.  Failure to provide the required information in order for a preliminary assessment to be made will result in the project being advertised as a total small business set-aside.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Therefore, requests for such documents without the requested information being provided will be considered non-responsive and no further consideration will be made.   This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.   Required information:  Provide information on three projects performed in the Lafayette, Louisiana area.   Information needed is a description of projects in sufficient detail to convey the size and complexity of the projects (limited to one page of information); dollar value of the projects, place of performance of the projects, and a current (reachable) point of contact with name, phone number and company name for each of the projects.  Also provide additional information concerning your company such as office locations, subcontracting arrangements, etc.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sensor Technology Systems, Inc., 2784 Indian Ripple Road, Dayton Ohio 45540-3638 in accordance with 10.U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The reason for justifying and lack of competition is that STS, Inc. is the only company that has the enhanced head's up display (E-HUD), Model 2755 and associated cables and connectors to upgrade the capabilities of the company's existing AN/PVS-21 Low Profile Night Vision Goggles. Based on market research, no other company produces the compatiable heads up display with the existing AN/PVS-21 night vision goggle. The E-HUD provides operators with an overlay of color and monchromic images directly onto the current field of view. The E-Hud provides a sensor fusion in the thermal infared band on tope of the existing image intensification display. The E-HUD also increases the overlay from existing HUD's from 13.4 degress to 31.7 degrees. It is anticipated a firm fixed price contract type to purchase approximately 250 units will be awarded. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes that it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the Contracting Officer. Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requriement based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. See Note 22 for any responses to this annoucement. The Government anticipates award on or about 29 September 2006.

<DESC>The US Air Force Defense Support Program (DSP) intends to issue a follow-on contract to the current DSP Post Production Services Contracts (PPSCs) to provide factory and operations site(s) support and sustainment to the on-orbit DSP satellite constellation (current and projected).  The new contract, the DSP On-Orbit Support and Sustainment Contract (DOSSC), is currently envisioned by the government to be awarded as a single contract.  It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released in the 2nd quarter FY07 with a period of performance beginning in FY08 with one basic year and four (4) one-year options.  Contract award is projected for the 4th quarter FY07. The DSP mission uses highly technical non-imaging infrared and other sensors to detect ballistic missile launches, space launches, endoatmospheric and exoatmospheric nuclear detonations, and reports them to US and allied forces and assets deployed worldwide through the Integrated Tactical Warning and Assessment (ITWAA) configuration control processes.  The DOSSC will require the following support: (1) Technical support to operational missile warning on-orbit constellation satellites, trending analysis, performance and data archive, as well as the training of new personnel; (2) Spaced based non-imaging infrared mission performance assessment for real-time mission support and infrared event data analysis; (3) Operational satellite and payload anomaly support to include root cause determination and implementation of corrective actions; (4) Contractor facility supporting on-orbit operations (either from the factory or at the ops site) must be Defense Security Service (DSS) certified and capable of processing classified information as required by the DSP constellation.  The contractor retains responsibility for recapitalization and/or replacement of any hardware/equipment obsolescence throughout the duration of the contract; (5) Program support includes management of contractor team and contract/business operations segment to track financial issues and deliverables; (6) Capability to develop software tools and implement command plans; and (7) Support at various government sites.  In addition, the government may seek to continue efforts currently on the PPSCs as follows: (1) rapid prototyping of data processing enhancements that maximize the utility of DSP data and maintain mission capability of aging assets; and (2) mission processor initiatives.  Interested parties must possess knowledgeable and capable individuals with the proper security clearances who can provide real time assistance/guidance to government satellite operators at the Mission Control Station and any backup site supporting operations.  It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded to the Northrop Grumman Corporation on a sole source basis; however, other vendors are invited to participate if a comparable level of performance is available. Interested parties who believe they have the capability to perform as a prime contractor in support of this effort must submit a Statement of Technical Capabilities (SOC), which includes the following information: 

     Personnel/Size Standard ? Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification, Large, Small, or Other, and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort.  Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate.  The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS 541710, with Note # 11, (Size Standard 1,000).  If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities please indicate clearly in your submission.  The SOC shall not exceed twenty pages.  The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein.  The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such.  Verbal responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting Market Research to ascertain if there are any commercial sources that can provide alternative means by which printed notices can be provided to the public.  SSA currently generates printed notices in Advanced Format Presentation (AFP) file(s) that are formatted for printing with a 12-point font.  SSA is looking to have AFP format file(s) converted to one or more of the following formats: 1) audio CD; 2) audio cassette;  3) Braille documents; 4) large print (18-20 point font) format  or 5) 508-compliant text-based format.   The majority of these notices contain tables with headers.  As part of the conversion process, row and column headers must be identified, and data cells in a table must be associated with header cells.  Therefore, SSA is seeking capability statements and estimated pricing from commercial sources for these services. SSA anticipates that there will be approximately 200,000 unique files per year that need transfer to one of these types of media. Each unique file may have a page count that varies from 2 to 60 pages with an average of 4 pages per file. 

Please provide a narrative of your capabilities to meet the following requirements:

Transfer from 12-point AFP format to audio CD, audio cassette, Braille, large print or 508-compliant text-based;
Provide standardized header information; Translation of tables; Turn around time-2 to 5 workdays; Mailing individual media using data contained within the AFP file; Vendor's quality assurance practices; Vendor's daily output capability;

<SUBJECT>U -- Request for Information - Continuing Educational Units
<DESC>Federal Railroad Administration - Office of Safety - Safety Improvement and Development Team
Request for Information - Continuing Educational Units.  BACKGROUND:  The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Safety, Safety Improvement and Development Team (SIDT) is seeking information from educational organizations interested in awarding Continuing Educational Units (CEUs) to FRA employees who attend training developed, delivered, and/or managed by the SIDT.  

The SIDT uses the Systematic Approach to Training (SAT) model to develop courses delivered to Office of Safety employees.  The SAT is a very rigorous adult training model, and the SIDT has customized application by developing a series of tools to perform up to three levels of validation for instructional objectives and pre/post testing.  

For the past two years, the SIDT delivered most technical training on the campus of Johnson County Community College (Kansas), and contracted with this educational institution for review of the course development and validation of learning objectives and pre/post testing.  Specifically, the college's Center for Business and Technology reviewed the SIDT training model, the validation methods, and the SIDT training qualifications, and performed their own validation of FRA courses.  Based on this assessment, Johnson County Community College offered CEUs to FRA employees attending training managed by the FRA SIDT.  

Beginning in Fiscal Year 2007, SIDT will deliver training to FRA employees at a variety of cities throughout the Continental United States.  This logistical change will require additional administrative and communication tasks for both FRA and the educational organization with whom FRA contracts.  For this reason, FRA has decided to issue this request for information to obtain feedback from educational institutions interested in contracting with FRA for CEU issuance.
 

TRAINING PROGRAM LOGISTICS AND INFORMATION:  1.	The FRA will deliver training in several cities in FY 2007, with delivery beginning in November 2006.  The FRA plans to use hotel meeting rooms for training delivery.  Classes begin either on a Monday or Tuesday of each week.  SIDT training specialists record attendance daily. 
2.	The SIDT schedules about 60 training classes each Fiscal Year, and usually schedules 20 FRA employees for attendance at each class.  Course hours range between 20 and 30.  It is both possible and likely FRA will be delivering between two and four training classes during any particular week, and this training may be delivered at more than one location in the same week.
3.	Students are composed of FRA employees and employees from various State and local governments. In the past two years, about 65% of students requested CEUs certificates. 
4.	The FRA prepares both a training course catalog and class/course calendar by the middle of October of each year.  The catalog lists the course name, number of hours, and course description with terminal level objectives.  FRA will provide both of these documents to the educational institution with whom we sign a contract, and will provide updated calendars if revisions are necessary during the training year.  (See the attached FY 2007 Safety Training schedule).  
5.	Each FRA training specialist develops enabling objectives for each course, and uses an in-house form to validate the level of learning for each of the cognitive and affective domain objectives.  The SIDT coordinator performs a second-level review of the objectives to ensure the instructional methods are suited to the level of learning the training wants to reach.  FRA also uses an in-house method for performing trainer and team coordinator validations of pre/post test questions if the training uses testing for a particular course.  
6.	The FRA expects that educational institutions interested in documenting CEUs would also perform a validation of the course materials, objectives, and tests.  The FRA would provide the course materials and data to the institution in either hard-copy or electronic format for review and filing.  FRA would provide these materials once for each course, regardless of the number of classes scheduled for any particular course.  If a course is modified, FRA would provide the updated course materials again.  The FRA modifies about six courses per year and develops about two new courses per year.  
7.	The educational institution would prepare the CEU certificates upon receipt of the faxed or e-mailed attendance form, and then send them to the SIDT training specialists via overnight package for delivery no later than 9 a.m. on Thursday morning of each training class or mail them directly to the students within two weeks of course completion.  
8.	The FRA anticipates issuance of a combined synopsis/solicitation for this requirement sometime during November 2006.  The acquisition will most likely be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The contract type will be firm-fixed priced or fixed unit priced. The anticipated contract term will be five years, composed of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.


INFORMATION REQUESTED FROM INDUSTRY:  The FRA requests the following information from educational institutions or organizations by October 6, 2006.  1. Recommendations on a pricing structure for review and validation of FRA developed courses, issuance of CEUs to students, and the administrative and record management costs associated with providing CEU's for FRA developed courses.  
2.	Information on the methodology and requirements for awarding CEUs, and how CEUs are usually calculated. For example, how many CEU's would be offered per 10-hour block of instruction?
3.	Recommendations on how the FRA might manage the logistics of this program with an educational institution to ensure timely issuance of CEU certificates to students after completion of a course.
4.	Information on the amount of time required by an educational institution to review and validate training courses, and the approximate amount of lead time that the FRA should provide to an educational institution to accommodate this validation for new training courses.
5.	Any other information that may be useful to the FRA when developing the solicitation for this requirement, including recommendations on contract type and term.

<SUBJECT>C -- Falling Marble at 1 Bowling Green (Historic Preservation)
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Public Building Services (GSA/PBS), Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit (2POA-M) on behalf of the Regional Historic Preservation Office, intends to procure the following Specialized Historic Preservation A-E Services:

The work described below concerns the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, NYC.  The building is a historic landmark and will celebrate its centennial next year.  All design and construction work connected with this building must be coordinated with GSA?s Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

In August of 2006 marble pieces fell from vertical interior surfaces.  Steps were taken to either remove the marble or temporarily secure it in place to alleviate further dangerous situations.  A-E will be required to:
1. Do a survey of all the stone paneling throughout the building.  
2. Panels exhibiting less than safe adherence shall be discreetly marked for:
a)	Immediate repair/reattachment (i.e. within first 30 days of a construction contract)
b)	Longer term repair/reattachment (to be done after the immediate panels are corrected.)
3. In addition to the discreet marking of panels create a survey drawing identifying the panels in need of repair/reattachment.
4. Prepare a report describing the methods used to do the survey as well as the results.
5. Prepare specifications/drawings depicting the methods that a contractor must employ to repair/reattach the faulty panels.  The detail in the specs/drawings shall be clear enough to permit qualified contractors to bid on and carry out the needed repairs/reattachments.
6. Recommend at least three contractors that have performed similar restoration work.
7. Prepare estimates of the envisioned construction work.
8. It is noted that some panels have already been removed or broken.  It is desired, to the extent possible, to repair/reinstall these panels. Panels falling into this category shall be specifically highlighted in your report.   If panels are beyond saving then replacement panels closely resembling the original shall be fully detailed and specified.

Selected A-E must have past performance of historic preservation work.
No solicitation, request for proposal or request for quote is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the GSA/PBS/RHPO requirements described herein may submit a response no later than Thursday October 5, 2006, to the POC listed below by 3:30 p.m. EST to be considered:

General Services Administration, Public Building Service, 
Tenant and Property Operations, Manhattan Acquisition Unit, 
26 Federal Plaza, Room 1655, New York, New York, 10278
Attention: James K. Smith.  

All interested parties are required to submit their qualifications to the Contracting Officer in the form of SF 330.  Submit to the above referenced address and include the routing symbol (2POA-M) to ensure proper delivery.  Please verify that all required information is submitted and accurate.  Firms should include all relevant information about past design projects similar in type to this project.  This is NOT a request for proposals.

Pertinent factors for consideration for qualification for this project, listed in order of importance are:

1. Selected A-E shall have proven historic preservation capability. 2. Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm with the type of services required. 3. Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team. 4. Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized work) within the time limitations. 5. Past record of performance with historic preservation.

Respondents should be advised that work may be required to be performed after normal business hours so as not to disturb tenants of the building.  The selected A-E shall provide their own material (including but not limited to ladders, scaffolds, safety gear, etc.) as may be necessary to conduct the survey.  The winning bidder shall be required to apply for security clearances for those employees intending to enter and work in the building. Any parties that believe they can meet the requirements of this project must ensure that their submission includes the following information:

 	Brief r?sum?s of the key personnel expected to be involved in the work detailing their qualifications related to historical preservation.
 	The method of doing the survey to determine the soundness and safety of the panels shall be briefly described and should include a description of ?go, no-go? criteria.  In other words, what level of survey reading would indicate a poorly adhered panel (i.e. requiring remedial repair) and what level indicates a well adhered safe and sound panel.

The ESOC was established to satisfy Secretary Powell’s requirement to collocate and then consolidate Department of State Servers.  In order to satisfy this consolidation requirement, the ESOC has procured VMWare’s ESX Server Software. VMWare ESX software will allow ESOC to minimize the Total cost of ownership (TCO) of its computing infrastructure within the ESOC, providing its customers a highly available, scalable server environment for a wide variety of critical DOS applications supported within the ESOC. VMWare Inc. retains the sole exclusive right to manufacture and distribute VMWare software, and is sole licensor for VMWare support and subscription services. There is currently no other software competitor on the open market that can provide a hardware virtualization product to meet the ESOC requirements as VMWare ESX software.  This Information presented in this memorandum represents our minimum requirements and is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate and complete.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3).  The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose , and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare,  plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier  and a removable drive.  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 1950.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. Currently, software integration testing between systems utilizing the CCD must be accomplished using 'workarounds' during systems development and Quality Assurance (QA) Testing.  As a result, end-to-end integration testing is not performed until IV&V testing commences.  This new equipment will allow software developers and testers to perform integration testing prior to the IV&V testing phase of the software development cycle.  More and more functional systems processing is being facilitated by database replication and processing services inside the CCD.  Through the purchase of this equipment, access to an 'integrated' development and testing environment will result in reduced development time resulting from fewer errors.  Reduced development time translates to significant cost savings. In summation, the Dell PowerEdge 1950 servers will meet according with Domestic Operation’s business requirements and future testing. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell PowerEdge 1950 was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements.

The Global Financial Management System (GFMS) project includes the replacement of the current 20 year old mainframe based Central Financial Management System (CFMS) with modern, web based COTS product. GFMS will be housed in the newly expanded Charleston Financial Services Center (CFSC). GFMS will work in concert with the recently implemented Regional Financial Management System (RFMS) that uses the same COTS software and technical architecture. The same technical architecture is also used for the Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) project with USAID. The RFMS portion of GFMS requires an expansion to the completion of the COOP environment in Beltsville, Md linked to the Charleston, SC primary site. To accommodate the increased amount of processing required at the COOP site to support the implementation of GFMS, the project requires the following servers: -	GFMS Financial System Servers				(8 servers) -	GFMS Data Warehouse Servers				(7 servers) All of the above servers would be configured with the Department's standard Windows Enterprise Server 2003 operating system. These servers would be housed in the COOP  facility in common racks, integrated with the existing RFMS  servers already installed. State Department Charleston personnel are proficient in the operation and maintenance of these HP servers. The Department's financial system must be available worldwide on a 23 x 6 ½ basis at the consolidated facility in Charleston, SC. The Department has already deployed HP servers for the production versions of RFMS that supports all overseas financial activity. GFMS will use the same technical architecture as RFMS and ultimately will be combined into a single database. The development environment that GFMS is built and tested in must be 100% compatible with production RFMS. This means the same release of software, the same ability to "mirror" production operations, and the ability to test new releases of the COTS software and the Microsoft operating system software before they are moved onto the production server racks.

The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

It is recommended that the Department of State use other than full and open competition under only one responsible source to procure Dell 1855 and 1955 blade servers for use by Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.   The requiring office is the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), Chief Technology Office.  This justification and approval is for a name brand justification for the Dell 1855 and 1955 blade servers.  The use of name brand is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State DS server consolidation and standardization.  DS has selected Dell blade servers as the standard server platform for the entire Bureau of Diplomatic Security IT enterprise.  Fifty percent of DS’ server inventory has already been converted to Dell 1855 and 1955 servers.  By standardizing on Dell Blade servers, DS will realize savings in the form of Dell Systems Management (central management of enterprise Dell server and storage devices), component commonality (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), maintenance and warranty costs, support personnel skill sets requirements, and investment protection (migration path to future Blade Server architectures). The Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the Department of State has a requirement for additional Dell 1855 and 1955 blade servers to further consolidate and standardize the enterprise.  The Dell blade servers are all being purchased with the same baseline configuration.  This configuration will support all known and foreseen needs in the enterprise, including web, Oracle, Exchange, Terminal, Print, and Blackberry servers.  These additional blade servers will be in addition to the servers that have already been purchased for the existing enterprise.

This solicitation RFQ #244-06-01646 is issued as a Request for Quotations.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 453998 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) plans to award a firm fixed-price definite quantity purchase order for Disposable Automatic Resuscitators to be stocked for pandemic flu.

Unit Price $_____, TOTAL PRICE $_________.  Product Requirements (including VAPHS' Evaluation Preferences):  1) Device must be disposable, single patient use.  2)  Must connect to a standard endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube.  3)  Device will operate solely from compressed medical grade oxygen source and be hands-free in its operation (differentiated from a manual resuscitation system).  4)  Device will have a pressure manometer which will display pressure in the ventilator circuit being delivered to the patient.  5)  Device will have a control that allows breaths per minute to be adjusted up to 20 BPM.  6)  Device will allow up to 5 cm/H2O of PEEP.  Greater range of PEEP will be considered preferable.  7)  Preference given to devices that deliver a range of FiO2 rather than devices that deliver only one preset FiO2.  8)  Tubing connection from device to O2 source will not be less than 6 feet.  9)  Preference given to devices with least dead space.  10)  Preference given to devices whicih will operate on widest range of patiaent size.

Applicants should request an automatic email notification of delivery when they send their application to the Government Contracting Officer. It is suggested that a verbal confirmation of Government receipt of your proposal package be obtained by the Government Contracting Officer posting this solicitation by calling (907) 786-3818. The Government does recognize that some applicants may not have access to email and in those cases we will accept proposals by fax or mail providing they are postmarked by midnight Alaska time(UTC -9) September 28, 2005.  Should you wish to submit a proposal via fax or mail service, you MUST call  the personnel listed under item IV above to inform them that you have submitted a proposal in this format prior to close of business September 28, 2006 (5:00pm Alaska Time UTC -9).  Please keep in mind that the recommended proposal submission process is via email to prevent unwanted delays to other vendors' proposals being considered for evaluation. Proposals submitted later than midnight Alaska time (UTC -9) September 28, 2006 will not be considered for evaluation. It is the responsibility of the recipient to ensure Service receipt of their proposal by the deadline.  The Service bears no responsibility for misplaced or mishandled proposals when the recipient did not alert the Service to the incoming proposal and method of transmission prior to the submission deadline. Proposal Format: Project proposals should follow the format described below and be no more than 10 pages long at font size 12. 1.	Cover Page:  Project title, Principal Investigator name(s), email address, phone number, and affiliation, proposal category (e.g., Request for Endorsement Only, Request for Funding but not Endorsement, Request for Funding and Endorsement, or Request for Multi-year Funding (indicate years as appropriate).  If this study was previously funded by SDJV as a multi-year study, indicate it is "YEAR X of a Y YEAR STUDY". Indicate the amount of funding requested for FY 07 and future years if it is a multi-year request.  Include proposal date. 2.	Problem/Issue Statement:  What is the problem or issue addressed by the proposed work, in relation to the SDJV priorities?  (see SDJV Strategic Plan at http://seaduckjv.org/pdf/StratPlan2001_06.pdf) - <50 words. 3.	SDJV Population(s) Targeted:  The proposal must address a North American population of sea duck.  Further, there must be a U.S. connection to the population.  For example, because sedentaria or borealis races of common eider do not enter the U.S., proposals dealing with those populations are not eligible unless there are clear implications for management of U.S. populations(s).  Additionally, proposals on federally-listed threatened and endangered populations in either the U.S. or Canada will not be favored unless there are clear and strong implications for a non-listed North American population. 4.	Justification:  Combine more information and literature review here.  What new information will be generated by the study that you are proposing and how far will it go toward solving the problem (i.e., considering the assumptions and limitations of your study, provide some perspective about how your work fits into the big picture)?  Maximum 1 page. 5.	Objectives or Hypotheses:  The proposal should have specific, clear and concise objectives, hypotheses and/or predictions to be tested. 6.	Scope and Location:  Provide a description and general map of the proposed study area, camp locations, and other important features as necessary.  Does the project encompass an appropriate portion of the population range and involve relevant jurisdictions to address the stated problems/issues? 7.	Experimental Design:  Planned methods including statistical treatments.  This section is critical to determining scientific soundness. 8.	Anticipated Output:  The SDJV has an interest in getting information out to the public in a timely and effective manner, such as through web sites.  List products or data sets expected in the time frame for which you request funding.  Submitters of multi-year proposals need to clearly define the results that will be attained annually and at the conclusion of the project. The breadth of the project should reflect the SDJV request.  If your study will take longer than the funding request period to accomplish the stated objectives, please identify sources of funding that are needed to accomplish the stated objectives and whether those sources are secured or unsecured.  In other words, if you request one year of funding but it will take two or more years to meet your objectives, how will you fund the study in Year 2 and beyond?  If you cannot meet your stated objectives with the SDJV funding you've requested, then you must indicate whether you intend to apply to SDJV in future years to complete this particular study. 9.	Management Implications:  What is the significance of the work to management of the populations concerned?  Be as specific as possible.  For example, rather than stating that "this information is critical to management...", explain HOW the information could be used to improve management. 10.	Relationship to Other Projects:  Describe the relationship of the proposed work to other projects, in terms of complementary scientific objectives, direct collaboration and/or shared resources. 11.	Literature Cited:  as relevant. 12.	Personnel:  One paragraph description of the principal investigator(s)' experience and responsibilities to the project (do not submit resumes or CVs). 13.	Schedule:  Beginning date, milestones, completion date. 14.	Budget:  Use the budget format provided below so it is clear what SDJV funding is requested and its intended use.  If a multi-year request, provide the multi-year summary budget table attached below.  Penalty for non-compliance may be rejection of the proposal.  [Note:  Proposals submitted for endorsement only need to provide only the total anticipated costs by funding source, not a detailed breakdown.] Include matching contributions ONLY if there is a high likelihood you will indeed receive them, and include ONLY the costs directly relevant to the study element. Acceptable matching contributions include real purchases as well as in-kind costs (e.g., full time agency staff or tenured professor's salaries, student or technician salaries covered by other sources) provided they are reasonable and commensurate with the particular study element.  For example, if the proposal is to add or augment an element to an existing study, you may pro-rate a portion of the total costs for, say, maintaining a field camp.  Similarly, if a vehicle will be provided as an in-kind contribution, it is acceptable to include an amount equivalent to rental or lease costs, but not the total cost of the vehicle. Requests for salaries for students or technicians are acceptable provided they are reasonable and commensurate with the applicant's involvement in the particular study element.  However, SDJV funds can not be used for cost recovery of full time agency or tenured professors' salaries.  Other unacceptable requests include costs like travel to conferences, publication expenses, tuition, and training. Overhead costs may be requested only if they are beyond the control of the applicant; for example, mandatory agency overhead charges levied on inter-agency transfers (see checkbox in budget table).  The SDJV will coordinate and directly purchase satellite transmitters (PTTs), therefore we will not pay overhead on PTT purchases.  In addition, the SDJV will not pay overhead on USFWS salaries, since all SDJV funds are currently administered with USFWS funds anyway. Capital costs - any request for capital items over $2000 (satellite transmitters excluded) must be accompanied with a detailed justification. Partial funding will NOT be considered.  You should be realistic in your budget - do not "pad".  If cost estimates seem unreasonable, you may lose points in the proposal evaluation scoring process.  Budgets will be scrutinized when proposals are reviewed by the evaluation team. Applicants should be aware that SDJV funds are typically not available until February of the fiscal year at the earliest, thus no costs requiring SDJV funds before that date should be included. Note:	The entire proposal should be submitted as ONE file in MS Word Format, not multiple files.  The budget table should be incorporated into the proposal document NOT submitted as a separate attachment. 15.	Budget Justification (optional):  Use this space to explain particular costs or to indicate the amount of time a person will be involved in the project. Other Submission Requirements: If the study was funded previously by the SDJV, submit an annual summary report (for format go to http://seaduckjv.org/fund/sdjv_annual_report_form_fy06.pdf).  Please note that annual project summaries for FY2006 projects are due September 28, 2006 -- you will not be eligible for future funding unless you have submitted that report. In the annual summary report, multi-year projects must report on significant deviations from original objectives, methodology, and partnerships, and must outline corrective actions and report on status of partnerships and funding to qualify for next year's funding.  A new proposal that incorporates any changes to the original proposal must be submitted for each year of a multi-year study.   Application Review Information: Criteria: It is important for applicants to review the evaluation criteria that will be used to score proposals received.  The following criteria will be used (this evaluation worksheet may also be downloaded at:  http://www.seaduckjv.org/fund/sdjv_evaluation_worksheet_fy07.pdf NOTE: To be considered for evaluation, the proposal must address a population of sea duck that enters the United States at some stage during its life-cycle. Evaluation Criteria and Relative Category Weights: 1)  Management Conservation Considerations:			WEIGHT: 6  i) What Information needs will this study address? (i.e., how many, their relative priorities within taxa) ii)  Does the proposal address a population with high conservation concern (i.e., a declining species or          depressed population) iii) Are there clear management implications? iv) Will the results be broadly applicable? v)  Has this topic been sufficiently addressed? 2) Methodology and Approach: 					WEIGHT: 4 	i) Is the general approach appropriate and presented/ justified logically? 	ii) Are the methods appropriate? 	iii) Are sample sizes adequate 	iv) Is the schedule realistic? 	v) Are objectives clear and realistically achievable? 	vi) Is the study being conducted in an appropriate location? 	vii) Is the proposal adequately researched and is relevant literature cited? 3)  Funding Considerations: 					WEIGHT: 3 i) Is the study cost effective/ logistically efficient (e.g, is logistical infrastructure in place that will make efficient use of ADJV contributions)? ii) Is there a substantial match of contributions proposed, particularly from non-US Federal sources? iii) Are the requested items appropriate? iv) Are cost estimates reasonable? v) If requesting multi-year funding, are final products/results worth the risks of failure, the potential for inadequate funding in future years to achieve objectives, and the lost opportunity to fund other studies? (Consider total costs over all years to the value of expected end products) 4)  Other Considerations:					WEIGHT: 2 i)  Does the study significantly complement other ongoing studies (i.e., is there an added value to the study) 	ii) Does the study involve multiple partners? 	iii) Will this study bring on new partners to the SDJV? 	iv) Will results be communicated effectively and in a timely manner? 	v) Is this a one-time opportunity? 	vi) Do PI's have a proven track record of successful investigations Review and Selection Process:   Applications will be evaluated and scored by the US Fish and Wildlife Service/ SDJV Continental Technical Team during their November 2006 meeting.  A suite of proposals receiving the highest scores will be recommended to the SDJV Management Board for funding approval.  The SDJV Board will make their decisions in December 2006. Common Reasons for Low Proposal Review Scores: a)  Proposal is missing required parts (read the proposal instructions for FY2007 and do not revise an older proposal you may have on hand and/or submitted previously.) b)  Management implications are weak or not clearly explained c)  Study is of a local nature with no broad application to larger geographic area, population, or conservation issue. d)  Information on methods is insufficient to allow full evaluation.  Reviewers will not assume that a study will do or will not do something unless it is specifically stated in the proposal. e)  Budget is vague or requested items are not justified f)  Annual objectives are not identified (for multi-year proposals, the annual objectives must be identified) g)  Proposal is portrayed as being more comprehensive that it really is-the proposal should focus on the objectives for which SDJV funds are requested.  In other words, how will the addition of SDJV funds expand the original objectives of application of your study? e)  Matching funds ratio is small; a proposal should strive for at least a 1:1 match of funding  Anticipated Award Date:  Contract awards will be announced no later than January 14, 2007. Award Administration Information: Award Notices:  Award notices will be provided to all applicants by email, mail, or phone during January 2007.  Notice of a successful proposal is not an authorization to begin performance (pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk).  A purchase order or contract signed by a USFWS warranted contracting officer and a formal Notice to Proceed will constitute authorization to begin performance.  Actual transfer of funds will not occur for the selected proposals and awarded contracts until February 2007 at the earliest.

1.	The Electronic Warfare (EW) Directorate requests the Brand Name or Equal Purchase of one; (1) Barco Reality 909 CRT Projectors, part number R9240014.;

2.	The Barco Reality 909 CRT Projectors will be used as spares for the projectors in; the F-22 Sim.  Attempting to use any other model would not allow us a cache of spare parts if; needed or an exact replacement if required.;

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) intends to award a commercial sole source purchase order for one year to Inxight Software, Inc. 500 Macara Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 for maintenance renewals of Inxight's Smart Discovery Awareness Server (formerly Intelliseek's Enterprise Discovery Suite), because Inxight is the exclusive source for technical support and maintenance including upgrades of software SDAS 4.0, 4.5 and 5.0 Java licenses.  Smart Discovery Awareness Server Serves as DISA's Global Information Grid gateway engine/ search broker for the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network Search Service pilot project under the Information Dissemination Management Program.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to issue the award as other than full and open competition and should not be considered a request for competitive proposals.  The determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 10 USA 2302(c)(1) and is solely at the discretion of the government.************

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&A)
FOR
OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
Upon the basis of the following justification, I, ________________________________ as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10.U.S.C 2304(c) (1): Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.
1.     AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY (FAR 6.303-2 (a) (1)).
Agency:
Defense Information Systems Agency
7 Skyline Place, Attn:  NE42
5275 Leesburg Pike
Falls Church, VA  22041-3801
Contracting:
Defense Information Systems Agency
5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 900A
Falls Church, VA  22041
2.     NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(s) (FAR 6.303-2 (a) (2)).
This action is for renewal of the licensing maintenance which requires the issuance of a sole source purchase order with Inxight Software, Inc.  Inxight has acquired the licensing software from Intelliseek Corporation.  This renewal of the licensing software is only available through Inxight Software, Inc. and therefore the requirement is not available for competition.  The purchase order estimated cost/price is $219,000.  The anticipated contract type is firm fixed price.  
3.     DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES (FAR 6.303-2(a) (3)).
This purchase will be to renew software licenses for secure base technical support and maintenance, including upgrades, to the existing SDAS 1.0, 3.5, 4.6, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2.  In addition this will also cover the use of four (4) servers of SDAS 5.2.  This service is required in order to maintain the existing system and ensure complete functionality to the war fighter.  
4.    IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).
10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements as per FAR 6.302-1(a)(1).  
5.     DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS
        (FAR 6.303-2 (a) (5)).
The current product by Inxight, Inc., has been used by the NCES Content Discovery and Delivery for the past four years to provide a search broker capability on the SIPRNet environment.  The current sole source contract HC1047-05-P-4324 was awarded on 7 September 2005 and expires on 6 September 2006.  
NCES Content Discovery and Delivery selected the Inxight product as an infrastructure component that facilitates the efficient and intelligent brokering of search requests within a secure environment to the diverse search engine population that includes both Content Discovery and Delivery search servers and those that may be in place at the combatant commands.  
Award to another source at this time would result in a substantial duplication of cost in fulfilling the Agency?s requirement of providing a search broker on the SIPRNet and a delay of time that agency needs to support the combatant commands services.  Since DISA intends to provide a Core Enterprise Service (CES) set for the functionality embodied in this product, it would be premature to select a different COTS vendor, expend funds to integrate it into the current architecture, only to replace it with the as yet to be identified CES service set.
6.     FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT OR POTENTIAL SOURCES (FAR 6.3032 (a)(6)).  
Inxight Software, Inc. is the sole source provider of this product/service.  An FBO announcement of a sole-source award to Inxight software will be issued for public review and comment.
7.     DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND RESONABLE COST (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)).   
Renewing the annual license with Inxight is cost effective because: (1) the Content Discovery & Delivery program has been declared a legacy program and is in the process of transitioning to an NCES Core Enterprise Service, (2) replacing the current search broker product would incur additional development, testing and integration costs that have already been expended for this purpose on the Inxight product, (3) Content Discovery & Delivery is currently in an operational phase with Authorities to Operate (ATO?s) using the current Inxight product, and (4) the current feed back from the Content Discovery & Delivery customers, the combatant commands, is that Inxight engine provides very good/relevant search findings.   
8.     DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH (FAR 6.3.3(a)(8)).
DISA investigation of search technologies found that the preponderance of COTS vendors focused on the provision of search services, but did not provide unification or federation technologies for globally distributed search architectures and systems integration, the key requirements fulfilled in the Inxight product.
The market research was conducted on three (three) different vendors, Vivisimo, Agilent Technologies, and Prodiance.  The market research on the three respondent vendors was as follows:
?	Vivisimo - The vendor?s search technology did not meet DISA requirements due to the lack of global distributed search architecture and systems integration supports.
?	Agilent Technologies ? The vendor?s search technology did not meet DISA requirements due to the lack of global distributed search architecture and systems integration supports.
?	Prodiance - The vendor?s search technology did not meet DISA requirements due to the lack of global distributed search architecture and systems integration supports.
The Inxight product brokers user search requests to over 30 catalogs across the DOD.  Using Inxight?s product for the upcoming performance period will cost less than using a new product since expenditures on system upgrades/modifications, customer support, and training would be avoided.  

NCES continues to perform an analysis of the existing system to determine if the functionality of the system required maintenance or replacement, it was determined in the best interest of the government to maintain the current licensing software as alternate software would hamper the success of the Content Discovery & Delivery mission.  
9.     ANY OTHER SUPPORING FACTS (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)).
The Content Discovery & Delivery program maintains a current operational capability for which a continued use of Inxight?s product is needed until implementation of the Net-Centric Core Enterprise Service sets.  The Agency has invested substantial cost and labor for this effort and finds it to be more advantageous to the government not to compete this effort and duplicate any costs.  This product is thoroughly integrated into existing interfaces and capabilities of Content Discovery & Delivery deployed baseline representing a significant investment that cannot be recaptured by selecting a competitive product.  
The software to be upgraded and maintained is complex and must meet operational and reliability requirements, the achievement of which requires unique equipment meshed together with specialized support to the Content Discovery & Delivery systems.  This software has been extensively tested to ensure that it meets its required purpose and to ensure complete functionality to the war fighter.  The entire infrastructure to support the software and equipment is in place.
This new effort will build on the successes achieved by the prior award.
10.    LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).
Inxight, Inc. is the only vendor that sells and supports this COTS product.  The software licensing and maintenance service for this product is proprietary to Inxight and no other company provides the required services.  
 11.    ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIER TO COMPETITION (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)).
The program has been declared a legacy program and during the coming period of performance and will continue to field products to additional Combatant Commands as part of the approved baseline.   During the transition to NCES the content discovery and delivery technologies will be either replaced or transitioned to NCES technologies.  This transition will produce a competitive acquisition environment that will address the expanded requirements set.
12.    STATEMENT OF PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE AND/OR DELIVERY SCHEDULE (DARS 6.303-2(a)(S-90)).
Period of performance will be 12 months from award date.
13. REFERENCE TO THE APPROVAL ACQUISITION PLAN (DAR S 6.303-2(a)(S-91)). 
This is not applicable as the acquisition falls under the ASC threshold.
14.    REFERENCE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)/NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM (NSS) IT AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (IM (DARS 6.303-2 (A)(S-92)).  Content Discovery & Delivery will adhere to all agency security policies.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

An individual employee of the contractor who does not pass the security clearances will be unable to perform services under the contract. If the resulting contract is to be awarded to an individual, all clearance procedures shall be applied prior to award.

Any person(s) testing positive shall be disqualified from performing under the resulting contract. Any individual employed by the Contractor deemed not suitable by the BOP requirements will not be granted access to perform services under the contract. This is a condition of the contract. The Contractor must be in compliance with Department of Justice regulations at 8 CFR 274a regarding the employment of aliens. A copy of this directive is available upon the Contractor's request. Contractor employees shall adhere to all institution regulations regarding conduct and performance. Contractor employees will be allowed access to the FCI Fort Worth at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Any individual performing under this contract may be removed if it becomes apparent that his/her conduct does not reflect the conduct of that prescribed for those people performing under this contract. 

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.

1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005: 

a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, " Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level: 

High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation

d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: 

1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
2) Favorable fingerprint results; 
3) Favorable credit report, if required; 
4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. 

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 

e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.

2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: 

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:

a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b. Favorable fingerprint results; 
c. Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. 

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. 

3. Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. 

a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. 

b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. 
c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. 

d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 

4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. 

5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

<DESC>Unigraphic Software to support National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright Patterson AF Base, Dayton ohio.
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

Contracting Activity:  ASC/PKWIE

Purchase Request Number:  F4FTAK6233A100

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(c) and FAR 11.105

I.  Description of Action

This requirement is for the acquisition of one Unigraphics (UGS) Advanced Designer Bundle and NX Runtime licenses as well as maintenance support for the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).  Estimated total cost of the requirement is $25,252.00; estimate was provided in Counter Trade Products, Inc., quote ?NASIC/SCXA.?  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to Counter Trade Products Inc., 7585 W.  66th Avenue, Arvada CO 80003. 

II.  Description of Supply/Service

The UGS software licenses and annual support as described in paragraph 1.  The Center?s Applied Systems Intelligence Division (NASIC/SMA) has a requirement to enhance its Unigraphics Computer Aided Design (CAD)/Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) process.  The software is used to support the implementation and integration of imagery exploitation methods and processes.  It supports Science and Technology imagery exploitation, facilitating image analysis.  The end user of the requested software provides corporate wide support for Unigraphics NX engineering.  The software is also used to provide custom tailored digital image products.  This software will be used by an Applied Systems Intelligence Division senior analyst at NASIC in support of Global War on Terror (GWOT) and homeland security missions to provide highly sensitive signals analysis as directed by SecAF to support multiple Air Force special access programs as well as evaluate foreign systems of military value. NASIC users are already knowledgeable in using this software which is important to providing timely intelligence products. The new software will contribute to eliminating current bottlenecks in image processing and analysis.  Its essential/salient features are:

1.	Use CAD/CAE analyses (e.g. signals, thermal, etc.) to determine characteristics and performance of foreign threat systems.

2.	Provide 3-D mesh models to various government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) analysis tools.

3.	Provide a site-wide collaboration environment for 3-D geometry analysis models.

4.	Enable access to custom applications for CAD/CAE workstations not connected to the licensed server.



III.  Applicability of Authority

The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) requires the additional UGS software licenses and support.  It is the only known software able to satisfy NASIC?s requirement.  The Applied Systems Intelligence Division provides analytic intelligence support to on-going GWOT operations.  In order to successfully accomplish this mission, this division requires the purchase of the indicated software.  Without this software the indicated division will unacceptably constrained in meeting NASIC commander direction to provide intelligence production to meet the growing tasking for combat operations.  

IV.  Market Research

SCXA management, acquisition representatives, and users are constantly monitoring the business market to ensure knowledge of other, less expensive, technically superior, or more readily responsive vendors on software similar to UGS software products.  We will continue to attend trade shows and conferences, review publications and talk with other users in order to remove barriers when future acquisitions are required.  As the Center identifies new requirements, we will make every effort to compete new purchases.

V.  Efforts to Obtain Competition

Proposed contract action may be synopsized, and a copy of this brand name justification will be included in the synopsis as required.

VI.  I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition for this acquisition is complete and accurate.

                                                                                     
                                                                                         NASIC/SCXA, 7-4061
                                                                                         15 Sep 06

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING Line Items 13, 81, 91, 92 ; The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Overseas Installations Branch (IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Department’s networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State’s enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each others’ chassis’.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassis’ to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 1950.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. Currently, software integration testing between systems utilizing the CCD must be accomplished using 'workarounds' during systems development and Quality Assurance (QA) Testing.  As a result, end-to-end integration testing is not performed until IV&V testing commences.  This new equipment will allow software developers and testers to perform integration testing prior to the IV&V testing phase of the software development cycle.  More and more functional systems processing is being facilitated by database replication and processing services inside the CCD.  Through the purchase of this equipment, access to an 'integrated' development and testing environment will result in reduced development time resulting from fewer errors.  Reduced development time translates to significant cost savings. In summation, the Dell PowerEdge 1950 servers will meet according with Domestic Operation’s business requirements and future testing. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell PowerEdge 1950 was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s throughput, processing and redundancy requirements.

The Intelligence and Threat Analysis (ITA) Division of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has the responsibility to provide the preliminary, on-going and comprehensive intelligence and threat assessments for the Department.  These assessments determine the security requirements for the State Department facilities and employees, other U.

The Intelligence Research and Information System (IRIS), an message handling and text retrieval and storage system, provides the ITA Division with an automated method to gather and analyze information for the preparation of the daily security alerts and briefings to the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security. The use of the Retrieval Ware system is based upon the fact the software is used for the IRIS system and identical to that procured by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) for their INR Information Support System (INRISS).  We must continue to utilize the same software to receive traffic from INR.  Thus, DS requests the sole source procurement of the RetrievalWare maintenance and support services.  Furthermore, the RetrievalWare is proprietary software from Convera.

Questions from Offers and Responses from Government

9/19/06

Question
I am getting pricing and need clarification on the following please:

"Must provide wall mount swivel bracket"

Doe this mean you need a quote for 95 x swivel wall mounts (entire
assembly) or to you already have those and just need the adapter plate?

Response
Yes, this means the government needs all pieces for the contractor to complete the entire assembly.  Please provide the entire assembly.


Question
We had a few questions as to how you wanted the system to be installed. Do you want it to be wall mounted are ceiling mounted.  

Response
The units are to be mounted on the wall.

Question
The Toshiba 20HLV86 does not fit the specs.  It does not have a 181 channel NTSC turner.  It has a 125 channel tuner.


Response
The TV specifications are intended to be used as objective guidelines.  Please select and offer products that best mirror the government specifications.


Question
As I mentioned on the telephone, on 20" LCD monitors the Aspect Ratio is 4:3, if you want 16:9 Aspect ratio you need to get 26" LCD monitors. Also, on the RFQ, you have Delivery/Installation. Are we installing the LCD monitors?

 Response
a)	See response to question #3
b)	If the vendor is unable to locate a 20" LCD monitor within the market place with a 16:9 aspect, the 4:3 aspect ratio is acceptable.

9/15/2006

Question
The only 20" LCD Television that we could find with you specifications was a Toshiba 20HLV86. Is this a approved equal if you could email me back to let me know that would be greatly appreciated.
 
Response
Yes.

Question
I have conducted an extensive search for a 20 inch LCD television fulfilling the requirements of this solicitation.  So far, I have been unable to find a unit that fulfills all of the requirements.  If the end user is aware of a brand and model that fulfills all of the specs, could that information be provided to us?

Response

<DESC>·	Questions and Answers to the combined synopsis/solicitation for FA4608-06-Q-S076  Sharepoint training and implementation
 Answers:
1.  In order for the government to determine pricing fair and reasonable we will need a price breakdown by time and materials to determine how you concluded to your overall price.
#2)  Our Sharepoint site will be used by approximately 600 users
#3)  All of the hardware is in place as well as the software and licenses
#4)  My thoughts were that each training topic would be about 3 days, though I defer to the company to find the best mix of consultation vs. training
#5)  The training is targeted for the Sharepoint site administrators (only 2 people); however, to maximize the value of the training, systems administrators will be attending as well.  
6.  Emailed and faxed responses are acceptable however, please call to verify I received you response in a timely manner.  Sometimes servers are down or fax machines break and the gov't cannot be held responsible for responses not received in a timely manner.

Questions:
1. Is the government looking for one fixed cost for all services or a time and material proposal?
2. How many total users need to be set up on the SharePoint Portal environment?
3. Is the server hardware already in place for the work noted in the solicitation to be performed?
4. Based upon the topics to be covered in the Training, how many days long do you anticipate the training to be?
5. My reading of the solicitation leads me to believe that the Training is targeted towards system administrators, not the SharePoint Portal Content Administrators.  Am I correct in this assumption?
6. Are emailed and/or faxed responses acceptable or do you require paper hard copy in your hands by the 28 April 0900 CsT deadline?

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0005 - Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HQ0423-06-T-0016 is hereby amended to provide the following additional information:

 (1)   The Nortel 61C PBX was moved to Rome from San Bernardino.  It is an identical system.  We would like to upgrade the San Bernardino PBX, which is now at DFAS Rome NY, and then connect the core of the Rome remote to the San Bernardino PBX ? now at Rome.
(2) The rectifier is currently set for the PBX properly in regard to amps and outlets.   

(3) The requirement for report units is reduced from two (2) to one (1).  Consequently, one (1) report unit (billable units need to be licensed for OTM) is required.

(4) No new IPE?s are required.  The inventory of the IPE's is included with the San Bernardino PBX. One dual T-1 card is needed only.





AMENDMENT 0004 - Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HQ0423-06-T-0016 is hereby amended to provide the following additional information:

THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO 2:00 EST on 28 September 2006.
(1) The power plant consists of the rectifier and the batteries.  The rectifier is already in place but the successful offeror will need to supply new batteries ? approximately 12 batteries.    
(2) DFAS is putting in a 50 Amp circuit.  DFAS  believes that is the number of amps that the power plant supports although the PBX does not draw anywhere near that number.

The San Bernardino PBX which is sitting next to the Rome PBX will be upgraded and the modules in the Rome PBX will be incorporated into the San Bernardino PBX.

(7) The IP server will be installed at this time but will not be turned on.  It will made available when the time comes.  It will be connected to the trunking side of the San Bernardino PBX which after the upgrade will be the Rome PBX.  DFAS wants the IP server installed but not turned on.  We just want the option to use IP trunking at a later date.  





AMENDMENT 0003 - Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HQ0423-06-T-0016 is hereby amended to provide the following additional information:

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome?s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The current DFAS PBX is a fiber remote off of the AFRL PBX.  The Nortel 61C PBX was shipped from San Bernardino to DAFS Rome.  The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the DFAS San Bernardino Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  The battery backup and rectifier will need to be replaced.

AMENDMENT1: RESPONSES TO PROPOSED QUESTIONS:
Q:  What brands of furniture are existing?
A:  HQ USSOCOM has a Command Standard of furniture consisting of Haworth and Kimball.  Haworth is the Command Standard for normal systems furniture configurations (i.e. cubicals and standard workstations).  Kimball is the Command Standard for executive level of furniture for private offices and casegoods.  Kimball systems furniture (i.e. cubicals and workstations) is also utilized for executive support areas (i.e. Flag officer administrative areas).  Additionally, Krug and InView are utilized in a few areas to support I.T. and Audio/Visual intensive areas (i.e. Command and Control functions, video conferencing, I.T. collaboration, etc.).  
 
Q:  Will other manufactures be considered for expansion or replacement?
A:  Not likely.  Prior to 1998 HQ USSOCOM stocked over 10 different brands of systems and casegoods furniture, making benchstock and spare parts storage problematic and difficult to maintain.  The Command Standard of utilizing Haworth and Kimball will ultimately replace all furniture throughout the Command, simplifying office reconfigurations, spare parts, storage, and repair of office furniture.  Simply stated, all non-Haworth and Kimball brands of furniture are being phased out and disposed of.  
 
Q:  Will other set aside preferences be considered, etc. 8(a), Hub Zone, SDVOB.  
A:  The set aside was established in the initial combo synopsis/solicitation as a result of a survey of expected market conditions.  
 
Q:  Will office space be provided for contractor on MacDill AFB?
A:  No.  There is a unconditioned warehouse provided for the storage of existing furniture.  
 
Q:  Will contractor be responsible for providing reconfiguration design and drawings?
A:  Yes, the contractor shall be responsible for providing rudimentary drawings of sufficient detail so that furniture supply vendors can develop a detailed bill of material (BOM), office and workspace/cubical prototypicals, and office layouts.  
 
Q:  Will warehouse storage for backup stock and other government furnishing be provided on MacDill AFB?  
A:  Yes, warehouse storage will be provided.  Benchstock for furniture is available and will be provided.  
 
Q:  Is there and existing inventory of all furnishing (Government owned / Leased) and equipment?  
A:  Yes, a detailed inventory of Government owned and leased furniture and equipment can be provided upon request.  
 
Q:  Will MacDill AFB be responsible for all terms and conditions of the lease agreements?
A:  Yes, HQ USSOCOM is the responsible entity on MacDill AFB for terms and conditions of lease agreements which deal directly with HQ USSOCOM.  HQ USSOCOM is not the responsible entity on MacDill AFB for any other lease agreements which are not privy to HQ USSOCOM (i.e. 6 AMW, HQ USCENTCOM, HQ USSOCCENT, JCSE, etc.).

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD
						 
FROM:  420 LRS/LGRVM 

SUBJECT: BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION, Spare Parts for  Lift King 50K Fork Lift Registration number 96E00065.

1.  The following items are needed to put the fork lift back into service ? all part numbers are Lift King reference numbers:

A.	Seal, PN # 2107379
B.	Seal, PN # 2106610
C.	Ring seal, PN # 2107024
D.	Brake Assembly, PN # 2115860
E.	Door Latch Assembly, PN # 705-1082
F.	Fan Assembly, PN # 7602891
G.	Shackle Chain, PN # 19759

  2. This fork lift is manufactured by Lift King and is a specialist vehicle - no other  manufacturers make or stock any of the above parts.  To the best of my knowledge, only OEM parts are available on the open market.

3. To fit anything other than manufacturers parts to this vehicle could jeopardize the safety of the vehicle and operators. This fork lift is used in the munitions area and is capable of carrying loaded munitions containers -  it is important to have a braking system working to manufactures specifications.   

4. This fork lift is one of only two assigned to RAF Welford - without this vehicle in service the munitions mission capability is reduced by  50%.

5. We have checked the FEDLOG database. These parts are not readily available through US military supply channels. 

6. We can accpet parts from any dealer authorized to sell Lift King products to the general public.

7.  I certify as complete and accurate the supporting data and technical requirements stated above. I understand     this forms a basis for justification of other than full and open competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR    
6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency    
Requirements?.

SPECIFICATIONS:

BI-DIRECTIONAL TAPERED BLADE AIRPORT SNOW PLOW

GENERAL:

These specifications describe a tapered blade snowplow capable of rotating in excess of 180 degrees, to discharge snow to the right or to the left.  This plow shall be ruggedly built from new material and definitely suited for extremely hard work under difficult conditions of high-speed snow removal.

MOLDBOARD:

The moldboard shall be not less than 16 feet long overall and not less than 12 feet X 6 inches long at each cutting edge (including nose shoe) and at least 18 inches high at the front end and 72 inches high at the discharge end of the moldboard.  The width of the path cleared shall be 10 ft. at the ground line.

The moldboard shall be not less than 10 USS gauge steel, paneled for additional rigidity, supported by five- (5) vertical and two (2) horizontal reinforcements.  The driving thrust shall be transmitted by a formed sheet metal structure welded to reinforcing flanges, which are welded to the moldboard sheet and to its horizontal reinforcements in such a manner as to distribute the load uniformly.  The driving thrust shall also be transmitted from the drive bars to the cutting edge reinforcement externally by means of two (2) 3/8 inches plate formed tee bars. There shall be an adjustable drive bar assembly of 4 inches x 4  inches x 1/2 inch angle irons to connect the plow to the truck push frame. Adjustable steady bars shall be provided for regulating the angle of the cutting edge with the ground.

PLOW ROTATING MECHANISM:

The plow moldboard shall be symmetrical about a longitudinal centerline and shall be provided with a planetary gear drive powered rotating mechanism operated by two 3.5 inches diameter by 12 inches stroke double acting hydraulic cylinders. The planetary gear set shall have replaceable bushings with grease points and the gears shall be 1.375 inches thick at the tooth interface. The components of the rotation mechanism shall be capable of being disassembled and replaced with normal mechanics tools. This rotating mechanism shall be capable of rotating the plow from right to left-hand discharge in a time not to exceed 13 seconds, while the truck is in motion.  The reversing cylinders shall have nitrided cylinder rods and shall be capable of being easily rebuilt.

CUTTING EDGES AND SHOES:

The moldboard shall be equipped with two (2) 1/2 inches x 8 inches abrasive resistant steel (C1090 or equal) reversible cutting edges, which attach with 5/8 inch carriage bolts to two (2) 6 inches x 4 inches x 1/2 inch cutting edge reinforcement angles. On the underside of each 
blade there shall be three replaceable wear shoes to prolong the life of the cutting edge.  Each shoe shall have a bearing surface of approximately 30 sq in, a wear surface hardness of at least 550 Brinell and a core hardness of at least 450 Brinell. The moldboard wear shoes shall be held in place with four bolts each. A wear resisting steel nose shoe or runner shall be provided at the front end of each cutting edge, held in place with three fasteners. The angle of shear at the cutting edge shall be approximately 35 degrees. The blade angle in relation to the direction of travel shall be 55 degrees (35 degrees of sweepback).


WEIGHT:

The snowplow shall weigh approximately 4,050 pounds excluding a truck mounted push frame.
