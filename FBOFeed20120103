<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), ASC/WISK is synopsizing information for the purpose of procuring an asset used by Battlefield Airmen. The asset is designated as a Line of Sight - Short (LOS-S) device, providing a lightweight integrated designator/sensor to enhance targeting effectiveness at ranges less than or equal to three kilometers.  The LOS-S project is a part of the overall Battlefield Airmen Operations (BAO) Kit program, which is in support of Air Force Special Operations Command.

The LOS-S is intended to be a lightweight integrated designator/ranger/marker sensor.  This device will serve as a three-in-one asset for dismounted operators to enhance targeting effectiveness at ranges up to three kilometers.  This capability will be employed across the spectrum of operations for a combat controller (air traffic control, air to ground terminal control, voice and data communications, range finding, mensurating target locations, etc.).  The LOS-S shall be employed globally in dismounted configurations accomodating the variety of combat control load configurations.  The LOS-S shall be rugged and satisfy existing material reliability and availability requirements.  The system must further be interoperable with the MR-1 small wearable computer.  The LOS-S shall additionally be small and lightweight enough to accomodate operator maneuvers and transportation.

Specific objectives of this effort will be to engineer, manufacture, develop and ultimately produce assets capable of meeting the minimum system requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Competitive proposals are expected to be solicited for during the first quarter of calendar year 2012

<DESC><br />Invitation to Review Draft Solicitation- Construction Manager as Constructor:
<p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is seeking construction industry comments and questions from construction manager (as constructor and as agent) viewpoints, regarding the attached Request for Proposal for the Cannon House Office Building (CHOB) Renewal Project. The AOC is seeking candid remarks that often are considered in discussions over a Federal RFP, but not voiced to the agency. Now is your opportunity to make your thoughts known without concern that it may affect your proposal. We look forward to your participation.</p>
<p>The closing date for remarks and comments is Close of Business, January 13, 2012. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit questions to Tom Gard: tgard@aoc.gov. We anticipate the final solicitation will follow within ten days thereafter.</p>
<p>Topics an offeror may consider follow:</p>
<p>&bull; Is the Section C (Scope of Work) sufficient for a firm fixed price proposal? If not, why not?<br />&bull; Are the bonus provision and its terms sufficient to compel the project team members to collaborate?<br />&bull; Are there any administrative processes that are insufficiently described or too onerous?<br />&bull; Are there any services included in the Section C that are not needed? Excluded that are recommended? <br />&bull; Are sections L and M indicative of the strengths needed to perform this project?</p>
<p>Suggestions for major re-writes will be as welcome as pointing out minor contradictions. Positive feedback is as welcome as constructive criticism. Please address your comments as a peer and partner in the industry seeking to collaboratively come to an integrated contract document, rather than a traditional client-contractor communication.</p>
<p>Comments will be acknowledged, but used only for internal re-drafting of the solicitation document. In order to encourage candor, comments will be kept confidential and no release or response will be made.</p>

<DESC><br />Invitation to Review Draft Solicitation- Construction Manager as Agent:
<p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is seeking construction industry comments and questions from construction manager (as constructor and as agent) viewpoints, regarding the attached Request for Proposal for the Cannon House Office Building (CHOB) Renewal Project. The AOC is seeking candid remarks that often are considered in discussions over a Federal RFP, but not voiced to the agency. Now is your opportunity to make your thoughts known without concern that it may affect your proposal. We look forward to your participation.</p>
<p>The closing date for remarks and comments is Close of Business, January 13, 2012. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submit questions to Tom Gard: tgard@aoc.gov. We anticipate the final solicitation will follow within ten days thereafter.</p>
<p>Topics an offeror may consider follow:</p>
<p>&bull; Is the Section C (Scope of Work) sufficient for a firm fixed price proposal? If not, why not?<br />&bull; Are the bonus provision and its terms sufficient to compel the project team members to collaborate?<br />&bull; Are there any administrative processes that are insufficiently described or too onerous?<br />&bull; Are there any services included in the Section C that are not needed? Excluded that are recommended? <br />&bull; Are sections L and M indicative of the strengths needed to perform this project?</p>
<p>Suggestions for major re-writes will be as welcome as pointing out minor contradictions. Positive feedback is as welcome as constructive criticism. Please address your comments as a peer and partner in the industry seeking to collaboratively come to an integrated contract document, rather than a traditional client-contractor communication.</p>
<p>Comments will be acknowledged, but used only for internal re-drafting of the solicitation document. In order to encourage candor, comments will be kept confidential and no release or response will be made.</p>
<p>Primary Point of Contact: <br />P. Thomas (Tom) Gard <br />Tgard@aoc.gov <br />Phone: 202-226-1493</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Serum Bank, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCID), has had an active, structured fresh blood and blood products acquisition program for the past decade. New requirements, especially testing of blood donations for hepatitis B and C and for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as, a need for strict confidentiality of records and donor counseling, when appropriate, dictate that the agency seek a contract for the acquisition of fresh human blood/blood products.<br />Blood collection and the need for fresh blood products are varied and important to the different programs at the CDC. Specialized fresh blood and blood products are used as reagents, biological products, control materials in research projects, and for reference diagnostic purposes. In general, fresh blood specimens are required 4-5 days per week, be in the investigators' laboratories within 2 hours or less of drawing and, because of the work schedules, be available before 08:00 am. Thus, the purpose of this procurement action is to acquire, on a timely basis, the blood and blood products testing, counseling and the required degree of confidentiality for blood donation viable for the research quality of the CDC.<br />Emory University is the incumbent contractor and already has a list of eligible donors who have specific rare blood types and titers required by CDC laboratories. Emory has the blood donors, readily available, that fit the profile for the specific blood types needed for CDC to conduct studies on various biological agents. Because expediency is required for many of the specimens to be viable for the research, their proximity to CDC premises gives them the unique advantage of providing these blood specimens to the CDC laboratories in the timely manner. Based on the above, we believe that no other source, but the Emory University in Atlanta, GA can realistically meet our needs. However, interested parties who believe they can provide the same service in a timely manner are encouraged to send a capability statement via email to Bbiltz@cdc.gov by COB, January 9, 2012.<br />Award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement IAW/FAR Part 13 is being contemplated. Individual call orders will be placed against the resulting BPA on the basis of Firm-Fixed Price (FFP). The total period of performance shall not exceed 60 continuous months from date of award.<br />All questions/concerns about the solicitation shall be submitted via e-mail ONLY to BBiltz@cdc.gov. No telephone requests will be honored. The associated NAICS code is 325414 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps Website.

<DESC>Repair and modernize the removable submarine covers (RSCs), which are mission critical
(MDI 97) air conditioned structures that enclose submarines during maintenance and
refueling/defueling availabilities in Dry Dock #2.

The RSCs are comprised of 17 stacks and 6 stair towers that will be disassembled and transported off the Shipyard to a vendor's facility to be blasted and painted. Project includes the installation of new hardware and fall protection anchors, structural repairs, and major upgrades to HVAC, electrical, fire protection and lighting systems.

Additional work in Dry Dock #2 will include blasting, painting and minor structural repair of the west stairway at Building 343 and repair of the structural tie downs.
 Energy savings will be gained through repair of the 14 inoperable existing Rooftop HVAC Units (RTUs) that currently prevent energy recovery of conditioned air, thereby heating and cooling spaces with 100% make-up air.  With air-to-air heat exchange restored, two high efficiency chillers will be
installed and attached to existing utilities to provide adequate conditioning to both
sides of the submarine, as well as provide required redundancy in the event of casualty
operation. Enhanced controls and metering devices throughout will regulate conditioning
with new variable speed fans to react to opened compartments limiting heating and cooling
losses. 

Further savings will be gained by cladding RSC units with additional metal
insulated panels, and refurbishing existing insulation and weatherization throughout.
Total energy reduction of 8,813 mmBTU is expected annually.

CAE USA Inc acquired AcuSoft Inc, and all of its assets and liabilities, on August 31, 2007.<br><br>This award will establish a new contract with CAE USA Inc to maintain, integrate, and provide upgrades to the MSDE, Stealth, and AAR components in support of release and fielding of the OneSAF to Australia under approved foreign Military Sales (FMS) case #AT-B-ZZV.  The new CAE USA Inc contract will also synchronize the MSDE and AAR efforts with the main OneSAF program for release of additional international software versions. These versions incorporate the latest technologies for mobility, lethality, sensor platforms, and survivability so that the OneSAF accurately and effectively represents specific activities of ground warfare (engagement and maneuver).  <br>

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources for a potential 100 percent set-aside for 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISTION MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning purposes only. This effort includes one project: (Project 090156), Install HTHW Lines S-57 to F/10296. Project scope includes replacement of steam heat system from underground steam distribution lines with gas-fired boiler heating systems for Bldgs 879, 867, 278, 256, 1403, 293, 295 and 296. Remove overhead steam lines at Bldgs 278 and 867. The heating system components are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. Also included is the replacement of the steam heating coil inside the air handling units inside the facilities listed above, with a new hot water heating coil, along with the installation of a new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchanger, hot water pump, and new DDC controls.
<p>Special requirements/concerns related to this project: <br />Steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the steam heating system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>
<p>The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238220 Size Standard: $14M.</p>
<p>Prime contractors who are 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a bid for this solicitation are highly encouraged to submit the following by 10:00 a.m. (local Dayton time) on 23 MAY 2011:</p>

<p>Firms interested should provide the above documentation. Fax or e-mail responses will be accepted. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a) Region V, HUBZone, or SDVOSB concerns. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages. Please include your DUNS Number or CAGE Code on your response. Failure to submit all information requested would result in a contractor being considered "non-responsive" in this requirement.

<DESC>Request for model-based evaluation of the health impact and costs of maternal health interventions in Ethiopia and strategic options for their combination, prioritization, and scale-up.
<p><br /><strong>1 INTRODUCTION / PURPOSE<br /></strong>To most effectively leverage Ethiopia's national commitment to reducing maternal mortality, it is essential to find feasible, affordable, and cost-effective strategies that are based on evidence and that account for local factors. Doing so will require considering many complex questions, many of which involve making decisions in the face of limited or nonexistent information. These types of questions cannot be answered by any single clinical study. Rather, they lend themselves to a modeling approach taken from decision science that can combine data and information from many different empirical studies.</p>
<p>Decision science provides a way to address these kinds of issues within the framework of a specific setting, allowing for consideration of existing infrastructure and resources. Such an approach can also combine information from a wide variety of sources, extrapolate costs and health effects beyond the context of a single clinical study, and evaluate multiple potential interventions. For these reasons, this is an appropriate methodology to estimate the clinical, population-level, and societal benefits associated with strategies to improve the safety of pregnancy and childbirth in Ethiopia, taking into account the costs and feasibility of alternative interventions and their operational complexity.</p>
<p>This study will synthesize relevant available data and carry out model-based analysis within a decision-analytic framework in order to provide information to the Government of Ethiopia on the likely health impacts, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different policy options for health system strengthening related to MCNH.</p>
<p><strong>2 BACKGROUND<br /></strong>Ethiopia has an estimated total population of 79.8 million. Rapid population growth exacerbates critical gaps in basic health services delivery. The Country's administration set up is divided into 9 regions and 2 city administrations. The regional states and city administrations are further divided into 817 Woredas (Districts). The Woredas are further divided into roughly 16,253 rural and urban kebeles. Kebele is the smallest administrative unit in the country.</p>
<p>It was announced in late January 2011, that Ethiopia has set a new goal of reducing the MMR to 276 by 2014, down from 590 in 2008. Over the last decade Ethiopia has made reduction of maternal mortality and improvements in overall maternal health one of its primary goals. More recently, it has reinforced its commitment to meeting MDG 5, as well as its own internal objectives set out in the Health Sector Development Program III announced in 2005, and Health Extension Program (HEP) introduced in 2003. Beyond its central goal of improving maternal health, HEP's objectives include a shift in health resources from urban to rural areas, promotion of gender equality in accessing health service, and the use of Health Extension Workers (HEWs) to help bridge the gap between the lowest level health facilities and local communities, all of which will have a beneficial impact on lowering the number of maternal deaths. Initial focus has been placed on expanding access to family planning, active management of third stage labor, partnerships with TBAs, and expansion of the referral centers. Further expansion and scaling up in the following areas is critical: skilled birth attendance, post natal care, contraceptive prevalence rates, and facilities with functioning EmOC services.</p>
<p>Many women who die in childbirth are young and healthy, and most maternal deaths are preventable with basic obstetrical care. The five leading direct causes of maternal death are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure, prolonged labor and complications resulting from unsafe abortion, although indirect causes of maternal death are substantial in Ethiopia as well (e.g., HIV, malaria, severe anemia). Knowing where to best strengthen the health system is crucial for reaching MDG 5 and other Government of Ethiopia health goals.</p>
<p>However, the information necessary to know where to strengthen the health system is difficult to observe directly. Evaluating the consequences of health system interventions for MCNH events, with a time course that spans a number of years and clinical events that occur repeatedly over a number of years (e.g., pregnancy) is challenging for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; It is often impossible to observe within the confines of a single study the complete course of a health problem or an extended series of repeated events<br />&bull; Even the best available data are generally based on surrogate markers and intermediate endpoints<br />&bull; It is often not feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials of every potential preventive and treatment approach<br />&bull; The information required to develop policies and regulations requires synthesizing data from many sources</p>
<p>Computer-based models make it possible to surmount some of these challenges. They can be used to extend information from empiric studies by extrapolating patterns beyond the time horizon of clinical trials; they can provide a formal framework for synthesizing data in an internally consistent and epidemiologically plausible way; and they can be used to assess many different strategies and interventions - including variations on how they are delivered - that would not be possible to assess in a single clinical study. Therefore, this study is proposed to provide information to the Government of Ethiopia on different data based scenarios for health system strengthening related to MCNH.</p>
<p><strong>3 PROJECT OBJECTIVE<br /></strong>Adapt an existing proven policy modeling framework and associated tools for application to strategic planning for maternal health policy in Ethiopia. In collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute apply the framework and model to provide strategic information regarding the planning, management, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality.</p>
<p>Examples of questions in Ethiopia:</p>
<p>&bull; Assuming adequate facilities, health infrastructure, and skilled human resources will not be available in all settings in Ethiopia, can we provide interim guidance to policy makers?<br />&bull; How can improvements in family planning and access to safe abortion contribute to strategies to reduce maternal mortality? Are there phased approaches to scaling-up maternal services that will be more and less efficient (i.e., cost-effective) and affordable?<br />&bull; What are the fundamental drivers of the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of specific packages of interventions and services? What are the potential benefits and economic efficiencies of intermediate facilities (e.g., birthing centres) that permit women to be closer to referral centers at the time of delivery?<br />&bull; What is the optimal design of a short-term plan in the context of a long-term strategic approach? What is the impact and cost-effectiveness of providing clean delivery kits, and will it be more effective to have kits be facility-based or woman-based in terms of accessibility at delivery?<br />&bull; Given that appropriate data is readily available, what are the differences in potential decisions for different regions in Ethiopia and what is the national impact because of regional differences?</p>
<p><strong>4 SCOPE OF WORK<br /></strong>The research approach will be highly tailored to Ethiopian context, using the latest data from program monitoring and evaluation, special studies, population surveys, other standard demographic and epidemiological projection models, supplemented by targeted data collection of local expert opinion.</p>
<p>&bull; To contextualize the approach to Ethiopian situation, comprehensive search and synthesis of existing peer-reviewed and gray literature, data sets, and expert opinion should be supplemented with focused primary data collection in areas where critical data gaps exist possibly including quantification of emergency obstetrics care availability and quality, description of the referral system for delivery, estimation of delays or barriers to maternal health care, and cost of care to households and government.</p>
<p>&bull; The approach will consider and appropriately account for urban/rural (and possibly pastoralist and regional) heterogeneity of disease burdens, health risk, health infrastructure, and access to care.</p>
<p>&bull; Model assumptions will be vetted and validated through analytic checks and stakeholder process.</p>
<p>&bull; The approach will evaluate the baseline situation, as well as selected sets of interventions--addressing research questions formed through a process that ensure relevance to local decision makers.</p>
<p>&bull; Outcomes projected for various strategic scenarios will include maternal deaths by cause, lifetime risk of maternal death, maternal mortality ratio, utilization of family planning, utilization of SBA, birth centers, EmOC, and other childbirth-related services, total fertility rate (TFR), and may include fraction of households not exceeding target family size, and fraction of maternal deaths attributable indirect causes such as anemia and infectious disease comorbidities, fraction of maternal deaths attributable to particular system failures in problem recognition, transportation to EmOC, facility access, or facility quality/capacity.</p>
<p>&bull; For each strategic scenario, the approach will also estimate program cost, net costs, and cost-effectiveness</p>
<p><strong>5 TASKS OF THE CONTRACTOR<br /></strong>Four are to be addressed under this task order. The first task is a scoping workshop to determine the final research questions to be addressed by the model. The second of these tasks is the adaptation of a proven maternal health policy simulation model to the Ethiopian context. The purpose of the second task will be to synthesize demographic, epidemiological, programmatic, and economic information in a policy model calibrated to reflect in rich detail the baseline situation in Ethiopia with respect to maternal health risks and behaviors, healthcare availability, and expected outcomes. The third task of under this task order focuses on simulation of policy scenario analysis using the Ethiopia-contextualized model. Policy scenarios will be designed to provide insight relevant to policy issues confronting local decision makers. The information generated will be of sufficient quality that it can assist country teams in strategic discussion regarding attainment of MDG5 and other health goals. The fourth task addressed dissemination of the model results for Ethiopia.</p>
<p><strong>5.1 TASK 1:</strong> Scoping workshop</p>
<p>Subtask 1.1: Facilitate the Technical Working Group (TWG) workshop between the USG and partner government and other local stakeholders to present the (generic) model, and identify locally-relevant research questions to supplement or modify core analysis.</p>
<p>Subtask 1.2: Prepare a Work plan informed by the discussion and agreements reached during scoping workshop. Work plan to include a primary data collection plan and a description of the set of specific research/policy questions to be addressed in analysis.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 TASK 2</strong>: Adaptation of a proven maternal health policy modeling framework and associated tools to the Ethiopian context</p>
<p>The awardee will work closely with the partner and PEPFAR country team on a series of steps, which will include the following activities:</p>
<p>Subtask 2.1: Identifying and synthesizing existing data sources</p>
<p>Subtask 2.2: Design and assist with application of tactical focused primary data collection (rapid assessments) to inform key model parameters.

<DESC><p>USAID/Afghanistan, U.S. Embassy Kabul invites you to express interest to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that establishes the terms and conditions applicable to future purchases of Financial Services as detailed in section 2.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is contemplating announcing an RFP for award of one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to multiple sources. USAID also reserves the right to award a single BPA agreement or IDIQ contract, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<p>A Blanket Purchase Agreement is not a contract. A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a simplified method of procuring quantities of services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish through the issuance of a BPA Call Order authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Payment of (BPA) Call Orders issued under a BPA will be made by the authorized Paying Office as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>USAID may place a Minimum Guarantee amount on the BPA. In the past this amount has been $3,000.00. However, currently that amount is not final.</p>
<p>An IDIQ is a contract. An IDIQ is an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract that selected vendors are in a position to compete through a Request to Task Order Proposal (RFTOP) process for Task Order award. Individually, RFTOPs are solicited to each IDIQ contract holder and award is made through a competitive process.</p>
<p>Payment of Task Orders issued under an IDIQ will be made by the authorized Paying Office as approved by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>It is undetermined at this time, if USAID will place a Minimum Guarantee amount on the IDIQ contract. Certainly, this is an area that will receive questions.</p>
<p>Determination to award a BPA or IDIQ contract mechanism will be made by the Contracting Officer after careful analysis of qualified interested parties that response to this Request for Information-Sources Sought-1201 (306-RFI-SS-12-01).</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The Purpose of this RFI-SS is to obtain a list of interest parties that can provide services of a Contracted Accounting/Financial Management firm who has experience or the proper staff skills sets to perform the following in accordance with section 2:<br />- Pre-award Surveys/Assessments<br />- Host Country Contracting (HCC) Capability Assessments<br />- Financial Reviews<br />- Performance Audits</p>
<p><br />QUESTIONS</p>
<p>All questions regarding expressed interest must be submitted in writing by e-mail. Written questions relating to this Request for Information-Sources Sought will be accepted through January 19, 2012. Any communication in reference to this Request for Information-Sources Sought shall cite number 306-RFI-SS-1201 in the SUBJECT Line of an email and be directed to the following e-mail address: CBrown@state.gov and MAhmad@state.gov Failure to place 306-RFI-SS-1201 in the SUBJECT LINE of emails addressing concerns or posing questions may be lost or may not be answered in time before the closing date and time.</p>
<p>NOTICE OF 306-RFI-SS-1201 CLOSING DATE AND TIME</p>
<p>All qualified parties interested in submitting a proposal at a later date, not to surpass 120 days, shall submitted an expression of interest electronically to email address CBrown@state.gov and MAhmad@state.gov not later than 3:00 P.M. Kabul local time on January 26, 2012 Your expressed interest is for a future RFP.</p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.  However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1855		<br />Name:		Correction Tape, Pen Style, Retractable<br />Description:	Retractable, pen-style correction tape applicator in a half-solid half-translucent case. Applies dry. Retractable tip guard protects tape when not in use. Measures 1/6" x 236" (5 mm x 6 M) . UoI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-NIB-1855		<br />Similar Items: 	UNV75605; BICWOELP21; BICWOELP11; BICWORTP11; PAP59601; PAP59603; TOM68633; TOM68684</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 18, 2012 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

b. Ensure each individual has picture identification and/or a drivers license, and proof of automobile insurance if they are driving.

d. If using a company car you will need to go through gate # 7 after you go to Base Security.  Gate #7 is the first right on Crystal Lake Road.  
e. If using a POV go through the Main Gate (2nd entrance on Crystal Lake Road).  Building 135 is the first building on the left through the Main Gate.  Parking is across the street on the right.
f. We will meet in Building 135, in the PWD (east) first floor conference room. 
g. Cameras are not allowed.
h. Only US Citizens are allowed on the Base.
i. NO MORE than two people per company for the site visit.

This follow-on procurement will be 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled-Veteran-Owned-Small Business under NAICS 236210, Size Standard is $33,500,000.
  Another synopsis will be posted after Rre-design is complete.

<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Pre-Filled Syringes. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) North is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong> <br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years.<strong> Anticipated selection date is June 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Point of Contact: Ms. Toni Massenburg, MMESO North, Team Leader, toni.massenburg@us.army.mil 571-231-5451 and Ms. Gail Tucker-Carlisle, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, gail.tucker-carlisle@us.army.mil 571-231-5904.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Pre-Filled Syringes. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $2,651,803.29. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, nineteen (19) of the total thirty five (35) line items represent the top four (4) products and account for 96.05% ($2,547,055.99) of the total volume in sales $2,651,803.29 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Ms. Toni Massenburg, Team Lead, at toni.massenburg@us.army.mil and Ms. Gail Tucker-Carlisle, MMESO North Clinical Analyst, at gail.tucker-carlisle@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO North that submission, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO North via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. <strong>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs.</strong> The MMESO North reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified and invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit products for testing and their best price discount quotes via an e-mail communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements<br />During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.</strong></p>

This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide only the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. One (1) box of each size and fill listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.</p>
<p>1) One (1) box per MTF test site of single use/dose unit, plastic latex free/safe, preservative free Pre-Filled Syringes of NORMAL SALINE / 10 mL in 10 mL or 12 mL Syringe<br />2) One (1) box single per MTF test site of single use/dose unit, plastic latex free/safe, preservative free Pre-Filled Syringes of HEPARIN 100 Units / 5mL in 10 mL or 12 mL Syringe</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon completion of the standardization selection. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO North and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (Clinician Efficiency of Care and FDA 21 CRF 3.4/CDRH). The packaging allows for easy opening without product contamination and allows for easy delivery of product to a sterile field as needed. Clinicians require the packaging to allow for easy access without product contamination and ease of delivery to a sterile field as needed.<br />2. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety and FDA 21 CRF 3.4/MM.4.03). The gradient scales on the Pre-Filled Syringes are clearly marked, easy to read, and cannot be rubbed off during clinical use. Clinicians require the gradient scale system to be clearly marked and easy to read to assist in making precise dosage measurements. The lettering and markings (graduations) on the exterior of the syringe cannot be erased or altered.<br />3. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety and FDA Title 21 CFR880.5860). The Pre-Filled Syringe plunger moves effortlessly and smoothly within the syringe barrel. Clinicians require that the syringe have smooth, precise plunger movement that is virtually effortless.<br />4. (Clinician Efficiency of Care and ISO 7886). The conical fitting is tightened to its full torque capacity without evidence of liquid leakage, air leakage, stress cracking, and/or separation. Clinicians require the device to be easy to twist and tighten the fittings without disconnecting/separation, cracking, or leakage of air or liquid. <br />5. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety and MM4.30). The Pre-Filled Syringes are clearly pre-labeled on the syringe with name of medication, dose, volume and expiration date by manufacturer in large, bold letters readable, and easily verified by clinician's visual acuity. Clinicians require the Pre-Filled Syringe to be easily read and verified at the time of use with type of medication, dose, volume and expiration date.<br />6. (Clinician Efficiency of Care/Patient Safety and (ISO 7886). The Pre-Filled Syringe remains securely connected to a port, needle or needless system throughout the clinical use of the product. Clinicians require that with perpetual use of the Pre-Filled Syringe with a luer-lock tip, the needle connection will remain secured.</p>
<p>Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO North and must be received by 5:00 PM EST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></span></p>

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT (Listed Below).

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the Quoting Contractor(s) to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.
  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a contractor(s) quote(s) to not be accepted by the Government. 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.   

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  

     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
    (ii)  PRICE

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating quotes determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors.  Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(c)  By submitting a signed quote under this solicitation, Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
  

(d)  Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the contractor supplying a quote has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Contractors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years with submitted quotes. 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (posted on the NECO site).  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

A quoting Contractor which lacks relevant past performance history will receive a NEUTRAL rating for this factor.
  Any Quoting Contractor which has no relevant past performance history, while rated NEUTRAL, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes received.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Quoting Contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives demerit for this factor.

OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting Contractor 's past performance.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the Quoting Contractor 's past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the Quoting Contractor 's past performance.


(f)  A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>The Field Programs Division (FPD) develops, oversees, and manages the implementation of OTI country programs. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Field Programs Division regularly engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of best practices , including dynamic monitoring, evaluation and learning in fast-paced, short-term political transition and stabilization programs in complex environments</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a 100% set-aside to Small Business (SB) concerns on or about 12 September 2011 for the acquisition of BASH &amp; Wildlife Control services to be performed at McConnell AFB KS. All responsible SB concerns may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be evaluated using Price-Performance Trade-Off (PPTO) evaluation factors with performance being significantly more important than price. The Government intends to issue an award to a single SB concern under a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Requirements Type contract on or about 12 November 2011. Services will be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. The expected award shall consist of one base period of performance (1 year, 1 February 2012 through 31 January 2013) and may include up to four optional periods of performance (each 1 year in duration, following the Federal Fiscal Year Calendar and running consecutively from the expiration of the base period of performance). There is no guarantee that any optional periods of performance may be exercised.</p>
<p>The primary emphasis of this program is to prevent bird airstrike hazards. However, the contractor shall provide a comprehensive wildlife control program to mitigate the risk of wildlife at McConnell AFB, KS. Wildlife encountered includes, but is not limited to: birds, foxes, dogs, skunks, snakes, turtles, coyotes, and deer. The program may include, but is not limited to, the use of trained birds of prey, dogs, pyrotechnics, harassment, trapping, relocation, airfield patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring and as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for said services. The successful contractor shall provide all personnel, management, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and all other items necessary (excluding Government Furnished Property). The contractor shall comply with all federal, state, and local regulations in performance of this contract. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561710, Exterminating and Pest Control Service. The Small Business Size Standard is $7,000,000.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages, the Performance Work Statement, the Department of Labor Wage Determination and the Past and Present Performance Questionnaire, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 12 September 2011, for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a proposal subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely proposal being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on CCR and ORCA registrations can be obtained at their respective web sites: http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>No response to this announcement is required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />*****</p>

<DESC><p><strong>****************************************************************</strong></p>
<p><strong>The US Department of Education hereby announces the release of the 2012 Small Business Innovation Research Program Fast-Track for Special Education solicitation.<br /><br /></strong>SBIR Fast-Track option - A Fast-Track proposal is a single proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities. Through the Fast-Track (Phase I &amp; II) option, the US Department of Education intends to fund proposals that have high potential for the commercialization of technologically innovative products that contribute to improved student learning or teacher practices from pre-kindergarten through adult education. By providing the opportunity to concurrently submit and review a proposal that contains both Phase I and Phase II activities, the Fast-Track option has the potential to minimize any funding gap between the Phase I and Phase II periods.</p>
<p>In order to apply for Fast-Track funding, offerors must download, read and comply with the SBIR&nbsp;Fast Track proposal instructions. A Fast-Track Technical Evaluation Review Panel will evaluate all eligible Fast-Track proposals. The Fast-Track proposal will receive a single rating for the proposed Phase I and Phase II project.</p>
<p>Phase I. - Phase I is to determine, insofar as possible, the scientific or technical merit of ideas submitted under the SBIR program. The proposal should concentrate on R/R&amp;D that will significantly contribute to proving the feasibility of the technological approach, a prerequisite for further ED support in Phase II. Institute awards are for periods up to six (6) months in amounts up to $150,000.</p>
<p>Phase II - Phase II is to expand on the results of and to further pursue the development of Phase I projects. Phase II is the principal R/R&amp;D effort. It requires a more comprehensive plan, outlining the effort in detail including the commercial potential. Awards are for periods up to two (2)-years in amounts up to $900,000.</p>
<p>SBIR Fast-Track awards are for&nbsp;total periods up to 30 months in the amounts up to $1,050,000<br /><br /><strong>PLEASE NOTE- This solicitation is for proposals in the area&nbsp;of Special Education.&nbsp; Any proposals received that are not in the area of Special Education will not be considered.</strong></p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved due to urgency (FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) or 16.505(b)(2)(i)).<br><br>Under the subject contract, ICF Jacob & Sundstrom Inc. is the incumbent contractor that holds the extensive knowledge, experience, training and certifications to provide the required Network Defense and Cyber Security Services to ARL and its external customers without any interruption in services.  Transitioning the required services to an alternate contractor would take at least three (3) months as no other contractors currently possess the knowledge, experience, training and certifications to convert this service adoption without any burdensome interruption.  Given that the subject contract expires on 31 December 2011, awarding this new work modification provides the only acquisition strategy able to transition and deliver the required services for the near term until a full and open competitive contract can be completed for the long-term.

<AWARDEE>The MITRE Corporation, 7515 Colshire Drive
, McClean, VA 22102-7539 US
<DESC>IRS Contract #TIRNO-99-D-00005 was initially awarded to the MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), as a competitive Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract. This contract action is not available for competition because it is a modification to a task order under an IDIQ contract that was awarded to a FFRDC, which is the mandatory source. In addition, the work to be performed under this task order is part of the CMS Integrated Information Technology (IT) Investment &amp; System Life Cycle Framework. As part of this program, all CMS systems must undergo a Security Test &amp; Evaluation (ST&amp;E) prior to accreditation or reaccreditation, before it is placed into an operational state, when a significant change has been made to an existing system, or at least every three years. Since the ST&amp;E's required for each specific CMS system vary, it is impossible to predict the number, types and specific systems that will require testing during a contract year. Also, due to legislative mandates, such as the National Level Repository and new ST&amp;E requirements, the price of each ST&amp;E performed is subject to adjustments. Per FAR Subpart 16.2, a firm-fixed-price contract type provides for a price that is not subject to adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience in performing the contract. Thus, due to the nature of this requirement, a fixed-price modification would not be appropriate.
