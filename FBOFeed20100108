<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) FOR NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR SAND DRAGON-Tier II Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for Route Surveillance This is an announcement that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to award a Sole Source contract to AeroMech Engineering Inc, for the purpose of continuing development and transition of a runway independent, heavy fueled engine, Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) with a minimum of 45 lb./500 W sensor payload to theater. This effort would demonstrate and transition a UAV system capable of runway independent launch and recovery. The UAV must be capable of operation on heavy fuel with 24 hours of endurance. This effort would include the development and deployment of a full launch, recovery, and ground control station as well as UAVs for a complete, operational system with an aggressive schedule (contact technical POC for specifics). Vendors who are capable of providing the services stated above, including meeting the aggressive schedule, shall fully identify their interest in being a prime contractor and submit, in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Estimated Funding</p>
<p>FY10&nbsp;&nbsp; $16.355M<br />FY11&nbsp; &nbsp;$ 2.14M</p>
<p>Responses are due not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, on the fifteenth day after publication of this NOCA and shall be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer, Philip R. Nelson, via email at Philip.Nelson@wpafb.af.mil. Security requirements restrict this potential acquisition to United States of America vendors/suppliers only. Responses received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the NOCA and will not be considered. Responses shall be no more than ten (10) pages in length. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches; foldouts are permitted but will be assessed towards total page count. Pages shall be single-spaced, single-sided. The font shall be Times New Roman and the font size shall be no less than twelve (12) point. Use at least 1-inch margins on the top and bottom and &frac34; inch side margins. Submitting your company brochure is not an adequate response. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be submitted as part of your response. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data. The Capability Statement should include the following elements in this format within the ten (10) page limit:</p>
<p>1. Prospective Vendor Identification<br />a. Company name<br />b. Address<br />c. Phone number<br />d. Fax number<br />e. E-mail<br />f. Point of contact information<br />g. A website address that provides additional information about the prospective vendor<br />h. The highest security clearance level that your company currently holds</p>
<p>2. Describe your relevant capability to provide further development and transition of an equally capable UAV system to theater, meeting the aggressive schedule. A brief history of the prospective vendor/supplier and its experience in providing the services is required. Provide information on up to three contracts for which you are currently providing or have provided services similar to the size and scale of this effort.</p>
<p>3. In the event that the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) for these services, identify your intent to submit a proposal as a prime contractor (and indicate the anticipated level of subcontracting/teaming).</p>
<p>4. All vendors responding to this announcement should indicate their business size, particularly if they are a small business. "Small business" means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUB Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business, large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), women owned businesses and HUB Zone. <br />Other business opportunities for the Air Force Research Laboratory are available at www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Importantly, this Notice of Contracting Action does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quote (RFQ), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. Any information received is considered market research and may be utilized by the Air Force in developing its acquisition strategy, Statement of Work, and performance specifications and metrics. This market research will be used to assess the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing any RFP. The Government will not respond or conduct formal debriefings to vendors as a part of this NOCA. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this NOCA. Again, the Air Force intends to award a Sole Source contract to AeroMech Engineering Inc. Accordingly, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Direct acquisition questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement. Direct technical questions to the Technical point of contact, Capt. Matthew Judge, AFRL/RYAS, at (937) 329-0514, or e-mail matthew.judge@wpafb.af.mil. Please provide a copy of your DD Form 2345 to the technical POC before requesting further technical or schedule details.</p>

<DESC>The government of Canada intends to invite bids on the acquisition of new accommodations at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan.  The project consists of accommodations for 240 persons in Area Canada 9 for the Canadian Contingent.   

Canada is serving as the procurement agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. 

Canada has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure.  The tender will be a firm price single envelope process. The validity period of the tender will therefore be a period of 30 calendar days from the tender closing date.  

The cost is estimated in the range of $2,650,000 (CAD).  It is anticipated that the project will be incorporated into one contract. 

The reference for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) is IFB-CAN-4015 and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for an ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 13 January 2010

2. Anticipated IFB release date: 20 January 2010

3. Anticipated bid closing date: 18 February 2010

4. Anticipated contract award date: 20 March 2010

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge and Government labor shortages in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  Urgency and termination issues are sometimes difficult to address as they relate to temporary hiring of Government employees and the bureaucracy and governing labor regulations.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects in DLA/DDC locations across the Continental United States (CONUS) and Hawaii.  

The DDC is seeking offerors to perform the above functions which will be evaluated utilizing a Lowest Price / Technically Acceptable source selection procedure. This procurement will be set-aside for a contractor qualified in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, using competitive procedures.  DDC anticipates a DRAFT solicitation will be released on or about 15 January 2010 and the final solicitation to be released on or about 08 February 2010. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will result in a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with cost reimbursement (no fee) contract line items.  The labor will be accomplished under the CPFF portion while materials and support costs as well as travel/training/conference costs will be reimbursed under the cost reimbursement (no fee) portion.  The Government may issue a single award OR up to as many as four (4) awards from the solicitation.  The contract period of performance is anticipated to be a one-year base period and four one-year options. 

A pre-proposal conference is expected to be conducted at DDC.  Time and locations will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website. 

The NAICS Code and Size Standard are: 493110 and $25.5 million, respectively. 

All documents to this solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://wwww.fedbizopps.gov/) under solicitation SP3300-10-R-0009.

<DESC>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) seeks to procure professional service on a sole source basis with Dr. Deborah Ann Colosi, Bethesda, MD 20816. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 13.501 (a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background
<p>NIMH Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS (CMHRA) supports the development of drugs to prevent or treat HIV disease of the nervous system disease. Efforts to expand NIMH's therapeutic research efforts as well as clinical trial approaches have been limited. Now that individuals are living longer with HIV, it is critical to identify a set of therapeutic strategies and potential drugs to better manage the complications of HIV infection of the nervous system. Therapeutic approaches have realized much success in managing HIV/AIDS; however strategies to prevent or treat the neurological complications that frequently accompany HIV disease have been less successful. This is due to limited availability of drugs across the blood brain barrier, the high degree of toxicity that accompanies long term use of current antiretroviral drugs, and the co-morbid mental health conditions that frequently accompany HIV/CNS disease, such as depression, anxieties, mood disorders, as well as others. The NIMH/CMHRA proposes to expand the therapeutics program by developing several initiatives to identify new therapeutic targets emerging from basic HIV neuropathogenesis research, and foster the pre-clinical and clinical testing of these drugs through mechanisms supportive of these approaches.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>Dr. Colosi has more than 5 years experience working in at Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. During that time, she participated in all aspects of the process of moving drugs from bench to bedside. This includes basic science research, planning and reviewing clinical trials, analyzing and summarizing results, and licensing issues. She has experience in developing and reviewing bioassays for drug efficacy, as well as biotechnology, including proteomic technologies. In addition, she has a strong background in basic science, including biochemistry and virology, as seen by her doctoral and post-doctoral research experience, which is essential to understand the complexities of targeting therapeutic interventions to HIV-mediated cell dysfunction. The CMHRA currently lacks this expertise in the drug development process and yet the need for a strong programmatic approach to therapeutics in NeuroAIDS is critical.</p>
<p>Dr. Colosi has been researching the current state of therapeutic approaches to managing HIV/CNS disease over the past 6 months and has written an extensive review of this area. In addition, she has convened a meeting with some of the leaders in the field to review NIMH's current efforts and develop a set of recommendations for next steps. Given the extent of her knowledge and NIMH's intent to incorporate a therapeutics component is our program initiatives in the basic sciences, Dr. Colosi is uniquely positioned to move our proposed approaches to the next phase. Dr. Colosi brings scientific and drug-company expertise to this effort, which is currently not available among the program staff of the CMHRA. To make an award to a new and different contractor, it will delay the on-going study because the new contractor would have to spend an unacceptable amount of time to become familiar with the issues which have been defined by Dr. Colosi through previous work. In addition, a new contractor would not have the benefits of the frequent and extensive discussions that Dr. Colosi has had prior to and during the workshop that she convened. Dr. Colosi's previous work for NIMH has been outstanding and her continuation is critical to the development of this important program to improve the lives of individuals living with HIV. Therefore, it is determined that Dr. Colosi is uniquely qualified to perform the required service. No other sources can satisfy the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work</p>
<p>Period of Performance is to be five (5) months from the award date, on or around February 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Place of performance is Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer, ln18x@nih.gov, no later than 2:00 PM January 14, 2010. Statement of capabilities must be submitted to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 3:00 PM Monday, January 18, 2010. It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a five year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Northrop Grumman Systems, 10 Norden Place, Norwalk CT 06855-1452.  The BOA will have a ceiling in the estimated amount of $11,253,847.

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NAICS Code 561210, Facilities Support Services applies to this acquisition with a small business standard of $35.5M gross revenue average over the last three years.

(2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies).  The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials . (End of Clause)."  Additionally, the estimated work breakout for this contractual effort is as follows:  60%=Fire Protection, 25%=Maintenance, Safety=3%, Engineering=3%, Information Management=3%, Administration=3%, Supply/Government Property=3%.  Based on this estimated work breakout, provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in this solicitation.

4)	Delivery capabilities.
5)	Evidence of risk and risk management plan.
6)	Compliance with applicable California Climate Action Reserve protocol
a.	Organic Waste Digestion Project Protocol
b.	Landfill Project Protocol

<DESC>Description<BR>Sources Sought Notice (SSN) <BR><BR>This is not a solicitation for bids/proposals but a SSN.  This special notice synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of Navy Medicine to conduct Market Research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.<BR><BR>Navy Medicine Research & Development conducts research to enhance Navy Medicines operational readiness and performance when delivering health care.  This effort is to provide comprehensive acquisition life cycle support services related to the American Warfighter as a weapon system in the context of Navy Medicine research.  This includes (1) conducting extramural medical research or intramural (on-site) medical research performed by contractors or (2) rapidly developing prototype infrastructure augmentations necessary to conduct such research.  The former includes medical research areas of interest such as:  biological defense; infectious diseases; combat casualty care; dental and biomedical research; direct energy bioeffects; environmental health; aerospace medicine; undersea medicine; tropical medicine; marrow donor program; medical modeling, simulation, and mission support; warfighter performance; epidemiology and behavioral sciences; and special focus topics such as traumatic brain injury.  The latter includes large-scale research infrastructure needs critical to Navy Medicines continued progress towards its strategic objectives and addresses enterprise or other major research services, capacities, processes (e.g., FDA IND), or facilities that meet the needs of Navy Medicine research efforts.  This infrastructure could be focused on individual investigators or large groups of investigators or on disciplinary or multidisciplinary efforts.  The infrastructure is intended to address the needs of researchers and scholars across the array of scholarly fields represented across Navy Medicine.  Attempts to define what qualifies as research infrastructure will be imperfect and Navy Medicine will no doubt need to exercise judgment in evaluating the eligibility of individual submissions.  Eligible examples may include:  commercial processes (e.g., Contract Research Organizations), manufacturing (e.g., vaccine development), laboratories, major research equipment and technical staff support, repositories (e.g., tissue banking, genome repositories, artifact storage), high-end or unique computing needs (in consonance with Navy CIO direction), support staff/facilities for developing, using or maintaining equipment or laboratories, and research staff for consulting or other services (statistics, surveys, research/analysis design, biological computing).  Examples not eligible are:  new buildings or complete building renovations or infrastructure not related to research.<BR><BR>Currently there are contract holders providing services under Omnibus 1 and 2.  Omnibus 1 was specifically designed for medical research, but only for that portion of medical research necessary to complete the mission peculiar to the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) and not all of Navy Medicine.  Omnibus 2 was specifically designed for services in support of NHRC medical research such as fiscal and program management related services and not for all of Navy Medicine.  Neither Omnibus 1 nor 2 addressed the Navy Medicine comprehensive extramural research requirement or the infrastructure necessary to sustain Navy Medicine research.<BR><BR>Companies for profit, laboratories, joint ventures, vaccine manufacturers, Contract Research Organizations, non-profits, and universities are encouraged to respond.  CCR registration is required for awards.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $497 Million, as the ceiling for the entire contract<BR><BR>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government intends to make Multiple Awards Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) to a Full and Open Lot and a Partial Small Business Set-Aside Lot. Individual Task Orders will be competed amongst the ID/IQ awardees within the specific Lot. <BR><BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids, or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject services. <BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUIRED: Interested offerors should provide a submission via email that includes a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist by the closing date.  Capabilities statements shall not exceed one (1) page and should outline the offerors ability to provide R&D services in the subject areas listed above. The submission must include a company name, address, telephone number, business size*, DUNS number, Federal CAGE Code, and point(s) of contact with an e-mail address, and a description of similar contracts.  * Business size is the average monthly employee count over the last 12 months and the average annual gross revenue (in dollars) over the last three complete accounting years (for all entities of the company, including parent and sibling organizations, independent of NAICS code).<BR><BR>This SSN is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.  <BR><BR>Responses are due NLT 1700 EST, 18 Jan 2010<BR><BR>Questions may be FAXed via 407-208-3401.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of responding to a potential new solicitation entitled "Study of Health Outcomes in Autistic Children and Their Families". The goal of this initiative will be to employ data on one, or more, large representative populations in the United States to describe the health and health care trajectories of individuals with autism and their families. The initial phase of the study will analyze existing data to describe health outcomes and utilization of health care services in this population, both before and after ASD is identified for a given individual or within a given family. It will also gather data that will determine the feasibility of using the database(s) for further exploration of autism risk factors in a subsequent phase of the study.
<p>Background<br />The CDC's most recent prevalence data show that one in 110 children have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This figure reflects an increase of 57 percent between 2002 and 2006. The CDC states that, although some of the increase is due to better detection, a true increase in risk cannot be ruled out. In any case, ASD clearly poses a significant public health challenge, with substantial research documenting the core social and communication deficits experienced by people with ASD, limited availability of evidence on efficacious and effective treatments, and poor access by patients and their families to existing appropriate treatments.<br />&nbsp;<br />Addressing this public health challenge will require substantial additional information, beyond what is currently available to researchers and policy-makers. ASD is highly heritable, and it is likely that gene-environment interplay has a role in the cause, as well as the expression, of ASD. There have been reports of statistically significant links between a family history of allergic or autoimmune disorders and ASD symptoms, as well as evidence of abnormal immune function in individuals with autism. Environmental exposures of various types have been proposed as potential contributors to ASD risk, including pollutants, pesticides, heavy metals, viruses, and fetal exposure to maternal antibodies or infertility treatments, although no studies have demonstrated a conclusive link. Of course, there is continuing public concern about a potential association between autism and vaccinations, overall or perhaps in a genetically-susceptible subgroup, despite several large-scale epidemiological studies that failed to find a link between autism and vaccinations.<br /><br />More generally, there is limited scientific evidence on the physical health correlates of ASD, particularly at a general population level. In particular, we know relatively little about the range of health trajectories of people with ASD, both before and after the initial presentation and diagnosis of ASD. Similarly, we know little about patterns of health care use over time among people with ASD, before and after ASD is identified. Such information may help identify potential risk factors for ASD and its health correlates that could be a focus for subsequent evaluation, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes among people with ASD. <br /><br />Moreover, it is likely to be valuable to assess health and health trajectories not just among people with ASD, but also among their (immediate) family members. As a particularly prominent example, health officials in the United States and elsewhere have seen changes in vaccination patterns in the general population, including increasing rates of vaccine refusal, but also vaccination delays and/or separation (e.g., vaccinating at separate times for measles, mumps and rubella, respectively, rather than at once via the "standard" MMR combination). Changing vaccination patterns may have private and public health consequences independent of ASD. Moreover, these changes, and any associated consequences, may be concentrated in families in which one or more people has been identified with ASD, e.g., because of greater behavioral response by parents in such families, and/or if genetic risk for ASD is correlated with risk for immune function abnormalities. Similarly, there are numerous anecdotal reports of elevated rates of gastrointestinal problems and food sensitivities in people with ASD, which might also have a genetic component; in turn, many parents address such issues with biomedical interventions for which there is insufficient data on efficacy or safety. <br />In this context, there is the need for a large-scale study of the health and health care trajectories of children with ASD and their families. A better understanding of the rate of comorbid medical conditions in children with ASD and their families, and medical decision-making within these families, will inform health care service policy and planning. Additionally, health conditions may provide clues to the heterogeneity of the disorder by providing phenotypic subtypes that could be the basis for exploring genetic and environmental risk factors for ASD, including the identification of a subgroup at risk of adverse outcomes from vaccines. <br /><br />The Health Outcomes study will employ data on one, or more, large representative populations in the United States to describe the health and health care trajectories of individuals with autism and their families. The initial phase of the study will analyze existing data to describe health outcomes and utilization of health care services in this population, both before and after ASD is identified for a given individual or within a given family. It will also gather data that will determine the feasibility of using the database(s) for further exploration of autism risk factors in a subsequent phase of the study. Specifically, the Health Outcomes Study will meet the following aims:<br /><br />1. Describe the medical health trajectories over time of children with ASD and their family members, in relation to timing of the initial identification of ASD. Of interest are rates of infectious diseases, neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, mood disorders, metabolic dysfunction, genetic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, nutritional status, sleep disorders, accidents, and stress-related conditions such as hypertension.

<DESC>The contractor shall for Task One shall identify and review the existing knowledge database for the S.E. Bering Sea. The specific area to be covered is from Port Heiden to Cold Bay along the northern shore from the shore to the 20 m isobath, which is about 3 miles offshore along most of the coast, about 170 nm of coastline. The database will include, but is not limited to, published studies in the literature, MMS reports, Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) reports, and interviews with people who have been working in the area. The last category will include interviews with fisheries biologists from ADFG and NOAA as appropriate and also commercial fishers. The report will also include a description of ongoing scientific studies in the area, and identify those with which collaboration might be desirable.
<p>Using the contacts made under Task One, the contractor shall monitor biological activity in the region from May to August, 2010. This monitoring will take advantage of any formal and informal reports that are available. In addition, dedicated visual surveys will be conducted by aircraft over the area during a four week period. The specific period will be chosen to capture the highest levels of biological activity, as identified during the review of the database. Ground sampling efforts will be conducted 1-3 times a week depending on weather in areas identified by the visual surveys. These areas will include "hot spots" where fish schools or foraging events have been observed, as well as "cold spots" where no schools or foraging have been visually observed from the air. This will enable us to detect "background" biological levels of activity and identify characteristics that define "hot spots". Ground sampling will include a series of tow nets from small vessels capable of sampling phytoplankton, small zooplankton species, large zooplankton (including crab larvae and larval fish) and juvenile fish species. Using hook and line, predator fish will be sampled and the stomach contents preserved to aid in detecting mobile forage fish and juvenile fish species that may be difficult to capture with tow nets or that are patchy and therefore difficult to effectively sample. This monitoring effort shall be repeated during the same time period in 2011 and 2012.</p>

<DESC>Financial and Business Solutions Schedule
Grants Management Day

GSA is hosting an Industry Partnership Day to exchange information on the new Grants Management SIN between current FABS Schedule-holders, vendors interested in getting on the FABS schedule, and the GSA FABS team.

This event is scheduled for January 22, 2010 from 8:00 am to Noon.  

GSA has added Grants Management Support Services (GMSS) to its FABS schedule.  Vendors can now offer these services under SIN 520-22:

Support and assist federal grants management personnel in all phases of the grants management process including, but not limited to, assessing compliance of grantees business and financial management systems, assisting awarding agencies in ensuring grantees responsible and accountable use of grant funds, assisting with ensuring that grantees performance is in full compliance with grant requirements, assisting government Grants Management Officers, Grant Management Specialists, and other grants management personnel, advising government personnel in managing Grant Financial Management systems, managing the project period of performance schedule,  evaluating on-going status reports, final reports, and other deliverable products required under the grant program, and assisting in grant close-out procedures.  

We will feature a workshop on How to Submit a Quality Offer and a brief presentation on how to submit a contract modification to add the new SIN for any interested participants.

We would like you to come prepared to discuss the following questions:

 Does the FABS SOW adequately cover grants management from beginning to end, excluding work that is inherently governmental?

 Has socioeconomic goals been a factor in other government procurements for GMSS?  For example, do agencies have a small business preference or require small business subcontracting plans in GMSS acquisitions?

 For what agencies have you performed grants management 
  services?
 What grant management opportunities have arisen because of 
  ARRA?

Come join us at the GSA Building Room L1301 at 2200 Crystal Drive Crystal City, Arlington, VA  22202 

Pre-registration is required.  Space is limited, so please register early using the following link: http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/eventView.do?viewType=DETAIL&eventId=5600&occurId=2742


Should you have additional questions please contact Patricia Whittaker at 703-605-2840 (patricia.whittaker@gsa.gov).

ELECTRONIC INVOICE INFORMATION

This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  The most common method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  Options within WAWF include a stand-alone invoice, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts, and a combo that includes both the payment request and the receiving document required to validate that the object of the invoice has been received in an acceptable condition.  The experience of this office in the administration of electronic invoices has shown that the use of the combo invoice, when available, will result in a quicker, more accurate payment.  The matching by the WAWF system of invoices and receiving reports individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity routinely cause problems because they do not appear together and must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the combo does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching.  The 2-in-1 is a similar method for service contracts.  Detailed instructions on how to create a 2-in-1 invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website shown below.

Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:  TOLL FREE 1-866-618-5988    COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095,  CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL 

Training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.  


ELECTRONIC INVOICING IS MANDATORY

UNDERSTANDING WIDE AREA WORKFLOW  READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS TO EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT

(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment.  

(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process

Acceptor:  The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the contract) who accepts the products or services tendered.  The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right hand box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.

DoDAAC:  As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code.  This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense.  Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.

Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 (contract) that will process your electronic invoices.  The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.

(c)  WAWF contractor input information.

The contractor shall use the following information in creating electronic payment requests in WAWF:

To create electronic payment requests and receiving reports, go to the WAWF-RA production website at https://wawf.eb.mil

Select invoice type:

	If billing for materials only, select Combo
	If billing for materials and services, select Combo
	If billing for services only, select 2-n-1*


*NOTE:  The 2-in-1 is preferred by some DFAS offices for materials as the invoice and the receiving document appear together in a complete document that reaches the DFAS office at the same time and avoids problems associated with matching the invoice with the receiving report.  No disadvantage results from submitting a 2-in-1 for materials.

(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the Send More E-Mail Notifications link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in-1).  This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice.

Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:

Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.  


Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information) (DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1)__ Are, __ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) __ Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) __ Are, __ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) __ Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half Street, S.W. (JR11-0203) <br />Washington, DC 20593<br />Telephone: (202) 372-3692<br />Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 3:00 PM Eastern Time on 25, Jan. 2010. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to contractor's question.
<p><br />Question: Regarding solicitation# FA2517-10-T-6020, the NAICS code for the requirement is 423430 which is for small business size of less than 100 employees. However, in the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps, it says the size standard is 500 employees (see the snippet below from solicitation). Please correct the solicitation so that it appropriate reflects the SBA size standard of 100 employees for NAICS code 423430.</p>
<p>(iv) This acquisition is procured as full and open competition. The NAICS code for this requirement is 423430, Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers. The size standard is 500 employees and a single award will be made as a result of evaluation of quotes.</p>
<p>Response: The Table of Small Business Size Standards, 22 August 2008, located on the U.S. Small Business Administration website under Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, states "the nonmanufacturer size standard of 500 employees shall be used for purposes of Government procurement of supplies."</p>

The following question has been submitted, with its respective answer:<br /><br />Question:&nbsp;Can you tell me if the warranty will be 24x7, or 9x5? <br />
<p><br />Answer: The "warranty," referring to CLIN 0004 for CheckPoint Enterprise Standard Support, will in fact be 5x12 business day support for all appliances listed in CLINs 0001 through 0003. The part number for CLIN 0004, CPES-SS-STANDARD entails 5 business days of support per week, with 12 hours of support each business day. The following link to the CheckPoint web site provides further information on what CPES-SS-STANDARD includes: http://www.checkpoint.com/services/techsupport/programs/security-appliance.html.</p>
<p>The second part of this Amendment serves to correct the product description of CLIN 0001. The description currently reads "CheckPoint UUTM-1 1076 Total Security Appliance." The description for CLIN 0001 will now read as follows:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001<br />Part Number CPAP-SG1076<br />CheckPoint UTM-1 1076 Total Security Appliance<br />Quantity: 1; Unit: Each</p>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Order to acquire land title, closing, and insurance services, required to update the title for real property located in Carroll County, Illinois, previously completed by a title insurance company, HB Wilkinson Title Company, Inc., 101 East Rapp Street, Mount Carroll, IL 61053. Services require title examination, endorsements, closing/escrow services, provision of legible documents pertaining, and the issuance of a title insurance policy of approximately $120,000,000.00 for the land and mineral interests.&nbsp; The amount of the title insurance is subject to change.&nbsp; The associated NAICS code is 541191.&nbsp; The anticipated delivery of an initial title commitment and exception documents is 4 weeks after award.
<p>This acquisition is reserved exclusively for small business, a total small business set-aside.&nbsp; Participation by title service firms and subcontractors located within the State of Illinois is encouraged.<br /><br />Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations can submit quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.</p>
<p>Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is encouraged. The BOP will be using Commercial Item Acquisition selection procedures. This notice is not a request for proposals. Interested offerors may request and obtain a Request for Quotation (RFQ) distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the RFQ will not be available. The web site provides downloading instructions. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. The RFQ will be available after ten days of posting of this pre-solicitation notice. The RFQ due date will be identified in the Request for Quotations solicitation, also providing the scope of work, and the following evaluation factors which are in descending order of importance: Past Performance (Sub-factors: Past Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), and Price. Past Performance&nbsp;is significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal in non-price factors, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification 3 to DARPA-BAA-10-16, Materials with Controlled Microstructural Architecture (MCMA), is to make the following changes to the announcement:
<p>The following sections are revised as follows:</p>
<p>Part One: Overview Information<br />&bull; Dates<br />o Proposal abstracts are due by 4:00PM ET, February 1, 2010.<br />o Closing Date, 4:00 PM ET, March 31, 2010.</p>
<p>IV. C. Abstract and Proposal Information</p>
<p>Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit a proposal abstract in advance of a full proposal. This procedure is intended to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review. The time and date for submission of proposal abstracts is specified in Section IV. D. 1. Proposal Abstract Date. DARPA will acknowledge receipt of the submission and assign a control number that should be used in all further correspondence regarding the proposal abstract.</p>
<p>DARPA will respond to proposal abstracts with a statement as to whether DARPA is interested in the idea. DARPA will attempt to reply to proposal abstracts via letter within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt. Should a proposer be discouraged from submitting a full proposal, the letter must contain feedback for the proposer regarding the rationale for the decision not to recommend that a full proposal be submitted. Proposal abstracts will be reviewed in the order they are received. Early submissions of proposal abstracts and full proposals are strongly encouraged. Regardless of DARPA's response to a proposal abstract, proposers may submit a full proposal. DARPA will review all full proposals submitted using the published evaluation criteria and without regard to any comments resulting from the review of a proposal abstract.</p>
<p>Proposers are required to submit proposal abstracts and full proposals by the time and date specified in the BAA in order to be considered. DARPA may evaluate proposals for a period up to one year from the BAA closing date.</p>
<p>The typical proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of one or more related technical concepts or ideas. Disjointed efforts should not be included into a single proposal.</p>
<p>Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled, for administrative purposes only, by a support contractor. This support contractor is prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research and is bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.</p>
<p>Proposals not meeting the format described in the BAA may not reviewed.</p>
<p><br />For Proposers Submitting proposals through DSO's BAA Submission Portal:</p>
<p>Proposals and proposal abstracts sent in response to DARPA-BAA-10-16 may be submitted via DSO's BAA Website (https://dsobaa.sainc.com). Visit the website to register for an account (via the "Create Login" link along the left side of the homepage), view submission instructions, and upload/finalize proposals. All submissions must be compressed and encrypted as described below. Proposers using the DSO BAA Website may encounter heavy traffic on the submission deadline date; it is highly advised that the submission process be started as early as possible.</p>
<p>All proposals submitted electronically by means of an Electronic Business Application Tool or proposal submission website (not including Grants.gov) must be encrypted using Winzip or PKZip with 256-bit AES encryption. Please submit proposal abstracts as one zipped/encrypted archive containing one file in MS Word or PDF format. Please submit full proposals as one zipped/encrypted archive containing two separate files in MS Word or PDF format, Volume I (Technical and Management Proposal) and Volume II (Cost Proposal). Submissions not zipped/encrypted will be rejected by DARPA. An encryption password form must be completed and emailed to DARPA-BAA-10-16@darpa.mil at the time of abstract and/or proposal submission. See https://dsobaa.sainc.com for the encryption password form.</p>
<p>Note the word "PASSWORD" must appear in the subject line of the above email and there are minimum security requirements for establishing the encryption password. Failure to provide the encryption password may result in the proposal not being evaluated. For further information and instructions on how to zip and encrypt proposal files, see https://dsobaa.sainc.com.</p>
<p>For Proposers Posting to Grants.Gov:</p>
<p>Proposers submitting proposals or proposal abstracts may elect to use the Grants.gov APPLY function if the applicant is seeking a grant or cooperative agreement. The APPLY function replaces the proposal submission process that other proposers follow. The APPLY function does not affect the proposal content or format. The APPLY function is electronic; proposers do not submit paper proposals in addition to the Grants.gov APPLY electronic submission.</p>
<p>Proposers must complete the following steps before submitting proposals on Grants.gov (these steps are also detailed at www.grants.gov/applicants/get_registered.jsp):<br />&bull; Proposers must obtain a DUNS number<br />&bull; Proposers must register their organization in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (https://www.bpn.gov/CCRSearch/Search.aspx)<br />&bull; Proposers must obtain a user name and password with an E-Authentication provider<br />&bull; Proposers must register the Authorized Organization Representative (AOR) in Grants.gov<br />&bull; Proposers must have the organization's E-BIZ point of contact authorize the AOR to submit applications.</p>
<p>Proposers electing to submit grant or cooperative agreement proposals as hard copies must complete the SF 424 R&amp;R form (Application for Federal Assistance, Research and Related) available on the Grants.gov website http://www.grants.gov/agencies/aapproved_standard_forms.jsp#2. Attach the abstract/proposal (if submitting a full proposal please upload two separate documents, Volume I, Technical and Management Proposal and Volume II, the Cost Proposal) as attachments to the application package. No other Grants.gov forms are required. Please note that Grants.gov does not accept zipped or encrypted proposals. More detailed instructions for using Grants.gov can be found on the Grants.gov website.</p>
<p>Grant or cooperative agreement proposals may be submitted to DARPA through Grants.gov, through the DSO Electronic Business Application BAA Tool (https://dsobaa.sainc.com), or in hard-copy. If proposers intend to use Grants.gov as their means of submission, then they must submit their entire proposal through Grants.gov; applications can not be submitted in part to Grants.gov and in part as a hard-copy.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the new DARPA security policies, submitters to grants.gov will still need to visit https://dsobaa.sainc.com/ to register their organization concurrently and are also required to send in a password form via email to ensure the DSO BAA office can verify the security of their submission.</p>
<p>For Proposers Submitting Hard Copies/on CD-ROM:</p>
<p>Proposers who wish to submit their proposal on a CD-ROM or in hard copy format (one copy of either format is acceptable) may do so. Please save the proposal as two separate files, Volume I (Technical and Management Proposal) and Volume II (Cost Proposal). The original hard copy and/or CD-ROM must be clearly labeled with DARPA-BAA-10-16, the proposer's organization, and the proposal title (short title recommended). The mailing address can be found in Section VIII (Agency Contacts).</p>
<p>Please note that due to the DARPA security policies, submitters still need to visit https://dsobaa.sainc.com/ to register their organization concurrently and are required to send in a password form via email to ensure the DSO BAA office can verify the security of their submission.</p>

<DESC><strong>**Offerors are reminded that the responses to these questions reflect the current condition of the procurement. The final RFP may differ and the differences may be inconsistent with these responses. The changes in the final RFP, if any, supersede responses to questions. Offerors will be required to propose to the final RFP.</strong><br /><br /><strong>**The Government Response has been added to question 22.</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>DRAFT SOLICITATION QUESTIONS and ANSWERS</strong>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 1:</strong>Reference Section L.4.3. There is a reference to a form called Attachment L1. This attachment is not included as part of the draft. L-1 is critical to offerors ability to begin the development of our Past Performance section and having the template in advance of the final RFP will allow offerors to take advantage of the time between the draft RFP and final proposal submission to build our Past Performance responses using the Government directed format. Has this document been developed by the Government? If so we would request that the Government release it as soon as possible. <br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) Attachment L-1 is currently being tailored for this solicitation and will be made available on FedBizOps for all interested offerors as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 2:</strong> Are second-tier subcontractors permitted, and, if so, how will the size status of said 2nd-tier subcontractors affect the attainment of socioeconomic subcontracting goals?<br /><br /><em>Government Response:</em>Second-tier subcontractors are certainly permitted on DTRA contracting opportunities, but for the purpose of the subject solicitation they will not count toward a prime offeror's subcontracting/socio-economic goal. Offerors must note that the stated DTRA subcontracting/socio-economic goals are tied to the prime offeror through its first-tier subcontractors.<br /><br /><strong>Question/Comment 3:</strong> Reference L.3.3.3.1. requires that &lsquo;all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position, skill level associated with the position,' etc. Even using the smallest allowable font, a table providing this information would be extremely lengthy and would take away needed space from the explanation of the technical approach. We recommend that the personnel response required by L.3.3.3.1 be outside the page limits for Volume II.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow unlimited pages for the labor chart required under Section L.3.3.3.1. The final RFP will update Section L.1.2 with the revised page limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 4:</strong>Reference M.2.3. Evaluation subfactors to Factor 1 are referred to as subfactors A-E and subfactors 1-5. To provide clarity in the required cross-reference matrix that the Offeror provides with the proposal, could the Government define which notation they prefer?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will revise the subfactors for Factor 1 to reflect subfactors A-E. This revision will be included in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 5:</strong>Reference SOO 2.1, 2.2, 2.3; L.1.2, (Table 1-2); L.3.3.3.1 (first sentence). Section L asks that the offeror 'express its technical understanding and approaches to performing all technical objectives as delineated in the SOO.' The SOO is a comprehensive document that delineates 31 tasks, many of which require a detailed explanation. Section L also defines additional information requirements to be included in the proposal. For the offeror to provide the government with a description of its capabilities detailed enough to facilitate a thorough evaluation, we recommend that the page limit for the Technical Approach section of the Mission Capability volume be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow a total of 20 pages for technical approach. This change will be reflected in Section L.1.2 in the final RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 6:</strong>Reference M.2.4.1, L.3.3.2.1. M.2.4.1, last paragraph, states that the commitment to socio-economic goals will be evaluated as part of the Mission Capability volume. However, the corresponding instruction at L.3.3.2.1 does not require this subject be addressed there. Instead, socio-economic goals are covered in Volume I (L.2.12), and offeror's response in that volume may not be seen by the evaluators of Volume II. We suggest that offeror's socio-economic goals be evaluated as part of the evaluation of Volume I. Alternatively, to save space in a severely page limited proposal, would the Government permit a brief cross-reference from the offeror's response to Volume II, directing the evaluator to Volume I?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Yes, Offerors may cross-reference Volume I as part of their Volume II socio-economic response. See L.1.3.10 that explains cross-references.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 7:</strong>Reference L.2.7. To allow sufficient time for review and comment, we request that the proposed DD 254 be released in advance of the final RFP.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will post the DD254 as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 8:</strong>Reference L.1.2 (Table 1-2). To allow Offerors to provide present and past performance information sufficient to support a thorough evaluation, we request that the pages allowed for each reference be increased.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government will allow 4 pages per reference for Attachment L-1, as defined in Section L.4.3 and the table in L.1.2. The final RFP will be revised to reflect the changes to page allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 9:</strong>Reference SOO 2.3.6. SOO paragraph 2.3.6 describes specific capabilities required in the biological threat reduction program area. Specifically the requirement statement reads "Provide the capability to support the areas of ...veterinary and public health system design and associated fields of study."<br />Should the phrase associated fields of study be interpreted to imply that capabilities are limited only to veterinary and public health systems? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The SOO paragraph 2.3.6 has been updated and revised to state: <br />"Provide the capability to support the areas of disease surveillance, detection and diagnostics; laboratory operations; biological safety and security, infectious disease medicine, epidemiology, research development and oversight, to include human and veterinary user requirements; associated fields of study for veterinary and public health system designs, which would be beneficial to the Biological Threat Reduction Program."</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question/Comment 10:</strong>Reference L.2.13. Paragraph b requires a statement in Volume I concerning OCI. Further, Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan also requires an OCI mitigation statement in Volume II. How do these requirements differ?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The OCI requirement in L.3.3.2.1 will be deleted. The Final RFP will reflect the change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 11:</strong>Reference L.3.3.5. Can the government provide relative time frames for the scenario to aid offerors in pricing the scenario?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Sample Scenario will not be priced.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 12:</strong>Reference M.2.4.1. One of the elements required to satisfy this factor is a OCI Mitigation Plan, vice statement as referred to in Sections L.2.13 and L.3.3.2.1. Is the use of the terminology Plan and Statement the same? If not, can the Government provide guidance on what is expected in the OCI Plan?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Please note that the Government will revise the OCI provision in the final RFP. Solicitation provisions L.3.3.2.1 and M.2.4.1 will be deleted. The remaining OCI provision, L.2.13, will require an offeror's statement as to whether an OCI (as defined in section FAR 9.5 "Organization and Consultant Conflicts of Interest") exists and whether a mitigation plan may be required. The offeror may elect to submit a mitigation plan with their proposal (offer) but, if there is an OCI, the Contracting Officer will require a mitigation plan prior to contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 13:</strong>Reference M.1.1 and M.2.2.1. Section M.1.1 states that Mission Capability has four (4) subfactors. Section M.2.2.1 shows five (5) subfactors listed under the Mission Capability factor. Are offerors correct in assuming that there are five (5) Mission Capability subfactors?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Section M.1.1 will be revised to reflect 5 subfactors.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 14:</strong>Reference H, 52-234-4 Earned Value Management System (Jul 2009). Does DTRA intend to require the monthly submittal of full Contract Performance Reports as generated from a validated Earned Value Management System (EVMS)? Although the intended contract type is cost-reimbursable, the nature of the work appears to be overwhelmingly of the Level of Effort (LOE) type. The application of EVM on work that is LOE in nature typically is impractical and inefficient. If DTRA intends to tailor the EVMS requirement, what is the anticipated extent of the tailoring? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The EVMS requirement will be completely removed from the solicitation.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 15:</strong>Reference L.2.13, L.3.3.2.1 (last bullet). The last paragraph in L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP implies that should a real or perceived OCI be identified and disclosed the Government may consider mitigation strategies to permit a contractor or subcontractor to continue the delivery of service provided the mitigation strategies are determined by the Contracting Officer to be adequate for the circumstance. Does this also apply to contractors and subcontractors providing services under the CTRIC and BTRIC contract vehicles? <br /><em>Government Response:</em>See RFP clause H.6.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 16:</strong>Reference Section H.6. In reference to paragraph H.6 which states "the Contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating directly or indirectly as contractors or subcontractors on any other contracts which provide support to Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of DTRA..." <br />Is it correct to assume directly or indirectly means as a prime contractor or subcontractor at any tier and/or to perform as a contractor or subcontractor whereby the procuring agency is other than the CTR Directorate but the CTR Directorate is the end user or a 3rd party benefiting organization?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The intent of this clause is to limit the A&amp;AS contractor from performing as a contractor of other procurements where CTR is the requiring activity (i.e. the organization generating the requirement or the "end user") The clause will be amended to read as follows: "The contractor and its subcontractors are precluded from participating, directly or indirectly, as a contractor or subcontractor on any other contracts where the Cooperative Threat Reduction Directorate of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency is the requiring activity during the period of the A&amp;AS contract or, in case of subcontractors, during the period they are subcontracted to this A&amp;AS effort."</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 17:</strong>In some instances, Offerors may wish to submit Past Performance references for work they have been performing as a subcontractor. In some of these instances the Prime contractor may now be a competitor for this CTR A&amp;AS solicitation. In order to avoid potential conflicts (such as bias) when submitting past performance references for subcontracted work, we assume the Government will allow Offerors to send their Past Performance Questionnaires directly to their Government points of contract instead of vetting them through the prime contractor. Is this assumption acceptable to the Government?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The subcontractors will send their PPQs directly to the Government POCs (end users), and not to the prime contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 18:</strong>Reference M2.4.2, Sub factor 2 Technical Approach (bullet 1 and 3) asks for offeror's to demonstrate an approach and process to assign personnel based on labor categories, skill level and qualifications to fulfill the requirements of the SOO. Bullet 2 references a comprehensive plan, it is our assumption that bullets 1 and 3 cover the comprehensive plan. Is our assumption correct or is there additional information that the Government is looking for in this section? <br />If our assumption is correct we would recommend that bullet 2 be deleted as it is redundant. If our assumption is incorrect we request that the Government provide additional guidance/clarification on what additional information you want to have included as part of the comprehensive plan.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> The Government will delete bullet 2 for consistency and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 19:</strong>L.3.3.3.1 asks that all personnel be identified by labor category, a description of the position and skill level associated with the position. Since this table will take up a considerable amount of space we recommend that it be excluded from the 15 page limit. By excluding the table from the page count it will allow offerors to provide more detailed technical responses.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 3 (labor chart is now unlimited pages)</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 20:</strong>Reference L.2.13. Pre-award Organization Conflicts of Interest is called out in Volume I. L.3.3.2.1. bullet 8 calls for an OCI mitigation statement. Recommend that L.3.3.2.1 bullet 8 be moved into Volume I to minimize cross referencing between the volumes. <br /><em>Government Response:</em> See Question 12 response.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 21:</strong>"The government has requested the contractor "provide a document management system and library to support the storage and retrieval of electronic and paper CTR documentation compliant with DoD Records Management procedures..." Does the Government expect that the tool used to support electronic records management is on the JITC PRODUCT REGISTER for DoD 5015.02-STD Records Management Compliance or is the existing Docushare system and paper records management procedures sufficient to meet the records management compliance requirement stated in 2.3.23?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The Government does not prescribe that the systems currently used for this purpose be maintained/continued by the successful Offeror. The Government requires expertise to: analyze current CT processes and procedures, determine if the current records management software system is optimal, make recommendations regarding potential courses of action to achieve compliance with relevant requirements, support execution of Government approved courses of action, and oversee future compliance. The government has no comment on whether a suitable records management system is on the JITC Product Register. The government will consider the recommendations provided by the contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 22:</strong>Reference SOO. What is the current level of A&amp;AS effort supporting the CTR? Please provide a list of current A&amp;AS contractor positions filled and unfilled with the following information: the mission area they support; the labor category; whether a security clearance/US citizenship is held or required; the place of their work assignment (on-site, off-site, at another Government agency, overseas at what site); specific language skill required; and current labor rate.<br /><em>Government Response: <br /></em>The current level of support and the areas supported by the A&amp;AS effort is detailed in the Industry Day presentation posted to FedBizOps July 29, 2009. The labor category and rates used by the current contractor are trade secret/protected information. The language skills required are detailed in section 2.3.21 of the posted SOO. Security clearance requirements are listed on the form DD 254. <br />The number of contractor personnel posted outside of DTRA headquarters and the contractor facility are as follows:<br />OSD/CTR Policy: 4 FTEs<br />OSD/Eurasia: 2 FTEs<br />DTRO Armenia: 1 FTE<br />DTRO Azerbaijan: 4 FTEs<br />DTRO Georgia: 5 FTEs <br />DTRO Kazakhstan: 4 FTEs<br />DTRO Uzbekistan: 1 FTE<br />SOAE Russia: 5.5 FTEs<br />BTRP Russia: 4 FTEs<br />CWE Russia: 0.5 FTEs</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 23:</strong>Reference SOO L.3.3.2.1. Program Assistant is a generic but unclear description of a key staff position. Please clarify the role envisioned that a Program Assistant would perform<br /><em>Government Response:</em> <br />There is no SOO reference L.3.3.2.1. <br />Section L.3.3.2.1 of the draft RFP refers to a lead Program Assistant. The government has determined that this is not considered a key staff position, and will be eliminated from the language of the final RFP. However, the current Program Assistant position traditionally has the responsibility for administrative functions performed on-site at DTRA headquarters. These activities include: cable coordination, correspondence assistance, providing quality control of products, travel coordination, task tracking, file management, translation coordination, report coordination, and schedule functions.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 24:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.28. We assume the level of classification for discussions, meetings and materials handling at the contractor provided facility is Secret. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> That information will be provided on the DD254.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 25:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.1.12. CTR interacts with many US Government or non-government agencies in the accomplishment of its mission. Please provide a list of applicable MOUs or MOAs with those agencies.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>CTR has no MOUs or MOAs in place pertaining to its provision of contractor support personnel to organizations outside of CTR.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 26:</strong>Reference SOO Paragraph 2.3.31. requires ". . . an orderly, complete transition from the incumbent A&amp;AS contractor, including preservation of and uninterrupted access to all program information stored and maintained in the incumbent's information/document management system." Will the Government provide details of the incumbents existing information/document management system? Can we assume that DTRA will provide "the incumbent's information/document management system" to the new contractor (or is it the intention to have the selected contractor implement a new management system?)?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>The current information/document management system is a Commercial, Off-the-Shelf System, which will be provided to the successful Offeror upon contract award. However, the successful offeror is not obligated to use this software; recommendations to update the CTR IT support infrastructure will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 27:</strong> Reference Section L. What is the difference between the "Technical Approach" (Section L.1.2) and the "Technical Plan" (L.3.3.3.1)? There are no other sub-sections called out in the L.3.3.3.1 Technical Approach, and the page limit does not support adequate discussion. We assume Technical Approach and Technical Plan are synonymous in this usage. Please confirm.<br /><em>Government Response:</em>There is no difference. The single Subsections of Management Approach and Technical Approach will be removed to reduce confusion. The final RFP will reflect this change.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 28:</strong> Reference Section L.4.3. Do Forms L-1 count against the two-page past performance limit? What is the page limit for Forms L-1?<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 8.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 29:</strong> Reference Section L.3.3.2.1 Management Plan. Within the statement in the second paragraph "senior technical experts for all areas shall be identified," The term "all areas" is ambiguous but we presume it to be "each of the CT program areas". Can you provide clarification?<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Depending on the approach taken by the Offeror, all areas could span CT, or could be specific to the divisions of CT. An example could be a technical expert in Systems Engineering, who could oversee all aspects of their expertise throughout CT, whereas an expert in veterinary medicine would likely be specific to the BTRP program area.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 30:</strong>Reference Section L.3.3.4 Transition Plan. : A transition requires the participation of the outgoing incumbent. Please provide a copy of the incumbent's transition out plan or, if a specific transition out plan does not exist, a statement of transition out activities that the incumbent is contractually obligated to support. <br /><em>Government Response:</em>The incumbent's "transition out plan" was placed on FedBizOps October 8, 2009, and will be transitioned to the final Solicitation announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 31:</strong> Reference Section L.5.1. Please clarify if information other than cost or pricing data is required. The first two sentences in the last paragraph of L.5.1 are confusing as to what is required now versus potentially some time in the future<br /><em>Government Response:</em>Per the last paragraph in section L.5.1 the offeror is required to provide "information other than cost and pricing data" in response to the Final RFP. The paragraph goes on to state that if, after proposals have been received, the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition did not occur and other exceptions do not exist (See FAR 15.403-1 (b)), the offeror may need to provide current, complete, and accurate cost or pricing data. However, until notified by the Contracting Officer, offerors should anticipate providing "information other than cost and pricing data" in their response to the RFP.</p>
<p><strong>Question/Comment 32</strong>: Reference Section M Paragraph M.1.1, Basis for Contract Award. The first sentence cites the number of sub-factors for Mission Capability as "four (4)." Elsewhere it is cited as five (5) sub-factors, and five are listed in M.2.2.1. Please confirm the intent is to evaluate the five (5) Mission Capability factors in M.2.2.1.<br /><em>Government Response:</em> See response to Question 13</p>

Description of Service and Work to be Performed:

NAWCTSD requires VE R&D services that encompass the areas of applied research, advanced development, prototype development, and technology transfer. 
The scope of this effort includes, but is not limited to, the following tasks:  requirements analysis, engineering design, development and fabrication of Government and commercial VE technologies, integration of VE data with Government displays, and integration of other Information Technology (IT) to include computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware, etc., to meet customer requirements.
The tasks will entail a broad range of VE research focused on the development of improved VE training technologies and methodologies, and the assessment of the degree to which new VE training and integration technologies may be applied.  Detailed requirements for the VEST ID/IQC orders will be defined in the SOW for each specific Task Order (TO).
Specific technology challenges associated with VEs include: 1) Development of comprehensive, mixed reality immersive training and mission rehearsal environments, 2) Methods and standards for VE integrated, synchronized environments, 3) Multisensory presentation - visually rich, high-fidelity display augmented with aural, tactile, vestibular, and proprioceptive cues, 4) Modeling to support realistic, natural interaction among VE participants, 5) Validated methodologies for collaborative training and rehearsal VEs, 6) Web-based VE Training Systems and Development of accepted standards for VE Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A).

<DESC>1.  The following topic is hereby added to the announcement:
Topic (p): Management and utilization of terabytes of Test and Comms data
Data and information continue to grow in size and complexity as weapon systems have become increasingly more automated and controlled by ever complicated and growing software modules.  With higher complexity of the systems as well as attempts to integrate stand-alone systems into a system of systems, the size of weapon system test data and communication information have grown from megabytes to terabytes and the trend continues to be upward.  As data collection continues to grow by orders of magnitude it has become extremely challenging to know what data and information is important, how much of it should be collected and what level of prioritization should be applied to analysis and reporting.  The DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) at the Army Research Lab in Aberdeen has made significant progress in scientific visualization, application of High-Power Computing (HPC) to data reduction, and research in parallel processing techniques.  The expertise of weapon systems analysts and engineers needs to be merged with these resources to generate solutions that allow analysis of the most critical data items and information in order to give the war fighter and decision makers the most comprehensive visual situational awareness of the battle space.    
2.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 30 September 2010."

Discuss ideas for the SOW and other requirements documents, and RFP in general, to allow for a better proposal; <BR>2. Identify specific requirement omissions from the SOW and other requirements documents that would better articulate and define IR/DRTS in concept and detail; <BR>3. Identify potential issues in the Draft SOW and other requirements documents that may unnecessarily constrain contractors' latitude in approach to the IR/DRTS requirements.<BR><BR>The IR/DRTS team anticipates that these meetings will not exceed 1 hours in length at our facility, and will be held 24 through 26 August 2009.

<a href="mailto:christopher.t.brackett@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville</a>
<DESC>A MARKET SURVEY is being conducted to determine if there are adequate contractors for this proposed Design-Build project which meet the specific criteria for a competitive set-aside award.  The proposed contract will be to remove and replace existing concrete airfield runway pavement (42,000 SY of PCC pavement removal and 35,000 SY of 16 inch PCC pavement reconstruction), base, and adjacent paved shoulders at the West Ramp; also relocate underground utilities and warm-up pad; to provide taxiway edge lighting, blast deflector, drainage and markings, and all necessary support; to demolish warm-up pad.  This is a Military Construction (MILCON) Air Force project.<BR><BR>All work within 200 feet of edge of runway including all pavement, lighting, finish grading, drainage, finish seeding, and control devices, excluding pavement markings, must be completed within the 45 day runway closure period.  The pavement markings in this area can be completed at later time and coordinated with the remaining markings for the balance of the project.<BR>The important impact factor is to return the operation of the runway after the 45 day period.  The 200 feet of the taxiway does not need to be operational, but all work shall be completed.  Failure to do so shall result in a USER liquidated damages of $37,630 per day.<BR><BR>The balance of all pavement, lighting, and (all other work necessary to use the taxiway and warmup pad), including all pavement markings shall be completed within (the schedule determined to be this construction season).<BR>Failure to do so shall result in a USER liquidated damages of $28,222 per day.<BR><BR>Contract is scheduled to be awarded by 31 Mar 2010 and performance of field work is to be complete by 1 Oct 2010.  This period includes completion and approval of design, submission and approval of materials and completion of construction activities.  NAICS Code is 236220.  The estimated cost range is between 10,000,000 and 25,000,000, but closer to $10,000,000 (20% of the work to be self-performed).  All interested contractors should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by January 18, 2010, 2:00 PM Louisville local time.  <BR><BR>Responses should include: <BR>     (1) Identification of the company as a Small Business and if applicable, the type of SBA program(s) (HubZone, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business, Small Disadvataged Business.)<BR>     (2) past experience should describe completed Design-Build airfield runway paving projects that are similar or larger in size and scope to the proposed project, the percentage of self-performed work, how that was accomplished, demonstrate the ability to complete a project in one construction season without prolonged impact to airfield operations and the performance rating for the work.  Similar projects are expected to consist of least 30,000 SY of 16 inch of PCC pavement for commercial airfields that are classified by the FAA as primary airports or military airfields.  Heliports will not qualify as experience.  <BR>     (3) Capability of obtaining performance and payment bonds for the project in the dollar range listed above, <BR>     (4) A statement verifying the contractor will self-perform 20% of the work and how it will be accomplished.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>NOTE:  If qualified/certified Small Businesses do not respond, this planned contract action will be converted to a full and open competition.  Send responses to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, 600 Dr. M.L. King, Jr. Place, Room 821, ATTN:  Chris Brackett, Louisville, Kentucky  40202-2267 or by email to Christopher.T.Brackett@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>This is NOT a request for proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.<BR>

VA develops the DMP content in this case.q. Recommend "within 7 days" be changed to "within 7 business days" to enable verification and validation testing to be adequately completed.  a. No.  Patient safety requires this time frame.q. Please clarify what is meant by "that patients should be required to respond to each DMP item";  Please provide the appropriate business rules.  a. Business rule is that VA desires that patients must respond to the questions education items or other items that are assigned on any given day and should not easily be able to 'skip' those items.                         q. Recommend the time be extended to at least 90 days to allow adequate time for development, integration, verification and validation testing, and documentation.  a. No. q. Please define the business rules and give an example of  how the contractor must cease to allow enrollment of new patients into the original DMP, once the VA standardized DMP is released. a. If VA develops a new standardized CHF DMP, enrollment should not be allowed for any previous CHF DMP or any co-morbid DMP that includes previous CHF DMP content.q. Since the standardized DMPs have not been designed it is difficult to respond to this requirement unless it is assumed that these DMPs will be similar to the vendor developed CORE DMPs.

VA will migrate to newer versions of the software over time and it is the vendors' responsibility to remain compatible with newer versions.q. Will the VA provide a standard format for this report?  If so, please give an example.  Recommend the report be on a "monthly" basis. a. VA will clarify in the solicitation q. VA Clinical Guideline for COPD is missing; please add   a. Will add web linkq. Are the attached VA Clinical Guidelines current to all national standards and standards of accepted evidence bases practice?a.  VA Guidelines are current to VA standardsq. For blood pressure monitors that are not designed for home use, offerors must provide documentation regarding their accuracy. Our monitors have clinical validation papers that were done by an independent third party of clinicians backing up the accuracy of the algorithm. I don't think it is fair for companies who use a bp module to "provide documentation regarding their accuracy" which will most likely be internally generated data.  a. VA will change to require documentation showing that the units are clinically validated for accuracy.q. Weight scales must include a mechanism for standard calibration within the units. I understand this as referring to the zero out function. I want to have it also state that this needs to be done at the beginning of each measurement to ensure the accuracy of the reading. If this function is done after the measurement, like a lot of other scales on the market, then how can they claim that the reading that was just taken is accurate? If the scale was moved then the reading may not be accurate if the zero out function is done after the measurement has been taken.  a. VA will change the specification to clarify.  Weight scales must include a mechanism that allows the user/patient to easily set the "zero out" setting.  The patient is not expected to be able to adjust the weight calibration of the scale against a weight standard.q. The RFI lists 350 mmhg as the upper range for the bp monitor. The industry standard is 280mmhg for the upper range for all bp monitors. Please ask that this be changed to 280mmhg.  a. For cuff inflation pressure the industry standard is 300 mmHg as referenced in AAMI/ANSI SP10:2002. VA will modify this item.q. As for the remaining DMPs by national, will the vendors continue to have the ability to charge for engineering, testing and clinical time for development? a. Noq. For blood pressure monitors that are not designed for home use, offerors must provide documentation regarding their accuracy. The provider we use has a B/P module that is clinically validated for accuracy which should be the metric for validation. The statement is vague and needs clarification.  a. Will clarify - VA will change to require documentation showing that the units are clinically validated for accuracy.q. Weight scales must include a mechanism for standard calibration within the units.  This reads as referring to a zero out function. Is this correct? a. Correct - VA will change the specification to clarify.  Weight scales must include a mechanism that allows the user/patient to easily set the "zero out" setting.  The patient is not expected to be able to adjust the weight calibration of the scale against a weight standard.q. The RFI lists 350 mmHg as the upper range for the B/P monitors. The industry standard is 280mmhg for the upper range for all B/P monitors.  a.  For cuff inflation pressure limits, the industry standard is 300 mmHg as referenced in AAMI/ANSI SP 10:2002. VA will modify this item.q. Development and IT, SCOPE OF CONTRACT AND STATEMENT OF WORK, Section 2.7, Section 3.2 requirement 2f and 2g, and Attachment I: Transfer of the data from financial data system to VA via Census-like interface is unrealistic. This would require either opening the VA Census interface to the outside world and doing a secure ERP integration to this external interface, or integrating an ERP system into system in the VA, replicating ERP data in the tele-health database, then transferring it from our system via a Census-like interface.  a. VA requires a timely way to track the inventory of individual devices sold, delivered or exchanged to VA facilities from all vendors.  VA has outlined a viable mechanism to obtain that data.  part of the RFP review processq. The same issues from 1. apply to the server and performance monitoring applications that run at Navisite and would somehow have to be integrated from Navisite to the VA or from Navisite to our system. a. VA has outlined a viable mechanism to obtain the required dataq. The same issues from 1. apply to the tracking systems we use.  a. VA has outlined a viable mechanism to obtain the required data q. Need more specifics on what exact data is required with a focus on data that can be reasonably acquired and transferred. A PDF report delivered manually once monthly should be considered as opposed to some multi-system, multi-site integration with a large development and validation cost and ongoing maintenance. a. VA has outlined a viable mechanism to obtain the required data.  q. Section 3.2 requirement 2b:  Transfer of survey responses to the VA needs to be clarified with respect to subjective and objective responses. Our system permits thousands of different subjective questions with thousand of different text or numeric responses to these questions. While our system can handle these, the current VISTA integration of the VA cannot. These are major extensions to VISTA and VISTA integration at the VA to handle these subjective questions. We have done this with other customers so we know our system can handle this, if the VA systems can. While objective responses are supported today, subjective responses will likely take at least 1 year to integrate and validate assuming both the VA and we modified their sides of the interface.  a. VA requires that VA survey responses be sent to the VA shortly after the Veteran submits them to the vendor.  Please see attachment E.  The VA Survey data transfer requirement only applies to VA nationally standardized surveys.  It does not apply to other non-national survey responses.q. Section 5.2 subsection E:  It has been the case in the past that it is almost impossible to get access to the VA datacenters in Austin and particularly Hines outside of normal business hours. This is due to lack of available escorts to supervise our resources. We need the 24/365 access described herein and the VA needs to strongly commit and budget to making this available otherwise we cannot commit to the service levels we are being asked to deliver.    a. Your proposal should include any important conditions you feel you are required to include (i.e. vendor access to vendor's equipment on VA property is required within one hour of arrival at the DPC assuming advance security clearances have been completed).  q. Section 9: We provide the field service manual as an electronic download from our website. It is not shipped with each order. a. This is acceptableq. Section 14.1:  We have almost 1TB of data in our system Oracle database. This is expected to double or triple over the next 4-5 years. The VA needs to provide more specifics on how they expect to take a copy of this each month. Trying to deliver even a portion of this data through a web interface is unreasonable. Trying to send multiple terabytes each month over the LAN/WAN of the VA to do some form of backup is also unscaleable. A recommended approach would be to provide each vendor a secure fiber channel on a VA SAN to which we could copy a standard Oracle RMAN backup each month. Please provide more specifics of what is desired and how it could be implemented given the volume of data being expected.  a. Please see a new Attachment M in revised solicitation.  Local data transfer is preferred (vs. transfer across the WAN).  Copying data to a local drive that could be removed by VA operations staff is also an alternative. Draft content of Attachment M:As part of the contingency planning process, the VA must have a procedure for accessing the veteran data from contractor systems under the unusual situation where the contractor systems were to become permanently unavailable for any reason. In order to meet this need, the VA will create and maintain a system that can import, and store a copy of all veteran Home Telehealth data from each of the contractor data bases.  This data will be in a data base format that will allow the data to be searched and read by VA staff.  In order to meet this need, each Home Telehealth contractor must generate a file that exports all patient data.  This file will be used to recreate the contents of the data collected in behalf of the VA.  The VA will use the file to populate a Microsoft SQL Server 2005 database.  The VA is able to use data exports from Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and MySQL.  The VA could also import a generalized formatted file such as CSV or XML.  The structure of the file will be defined by mutual agreement.  The VA requires that the file be generated monthly on a regular schedule defined by mutual agreement.  The file will be electronically transferred in a secure manner to a directory of a secured VA system using a simple process defined by mutual agreement such as secure FTP. This does not replace any other system backup requirement.q. SPECIFICATIONS, Section 2.6: What is expected for cross-coverage of patients by care coordinators at different facilities? Is it required for the Care Manager to have a single user login which allows them to see patients of another Care Manager in another facility? If the care Manager can login into each facility using their login for that facility, is it acceptable?  a. This question appears to refer to specification 2.2 and not to 2.6. Specification 2.2 is for provision of a mechanism for review and management of patient data at another facility/location by an alternate care coordinator (specifically assigned at the time of need by the VISN Lead or designee) in event of emergency/disaster or loss of key personnel.  Offered mechanism and ease of use will be subject to evaluation.q. Section 2.12 and 2.16: Providing Ad-Hoc Queries is a very costly feature to develop and validate. Moreover the scope of the Ad-Hoc Query data set has to be defined, as does the scope of reporting elements to be added. Is this a database query type interface (SQL) or a reporting type interface or both? Integrating a third party reporting tool such as Crystal Reports or Actuate Reports is possible, but typically comes with a per user license costing $1000s. Please specify the scope of the dataset, query set and data report types. Even if the requirement is a simpler Excel CSV dump of a chosen data subset, please provide more detailed specs.  a. VA will review and clarify q. Section 2.20: Providing a role to allow viewing of VA patient data across the entire VA is a dangerous concept from a patient security point of view. Is this limited to a few? How are these few authorized and setup? What is the process for doing this? Today each account (facility) can manage its users and roles. What is the analog for a VA wide user? Assuming we have this setup then we get more questions. What is the scope of data they should be able to see? What are they allowed to do with this data? It is unclear if this is something within the scope of the vendor viewer, which is primarily a viewer for a patient panel related to a care providing team. So do we need a new tool to do this? When would this be expected? Specs?a. Specification 2.2 is for provision of a mechanism for review and management (as per usual processes, utilizing the vendor viewer) of all patient data at another facility/location by an alternate care coordinator (specifically assigned at the time of need by the VISN Lead or designee) in the event of emergency/disaster or loss of key personnel only q. Section 2a: Refurbishment needs more specifics. What if we receive an unrefurbishable unit that is damaged - send a new unit and bill the VA? What if the cosmetics are bad - replace the plastics and bill the VA? What about the VA labeling - it is sometimes unremovable? What are the cosmetic standards we are agreeing to avoid follow-on customer concerns the unit is "scratched"?  How is the unit returned by the VA - in the original packaging or loose bubble wrapped? Are the accessories included or are we replacing? By FDA guideline we have to return complete and tested units, including accessories and IFU, properly packed to our specs. a. Refurbishment would include repair of cosmetics. We will modify the specification.q. Section 3.0 - Cellular communication option: Is an external cellular modem acceptable? Using a patient's cell phone is truly an integration nightmare, and building a cellular modem into a patient appliance is costly and complex. a. The specification is for a device either included within the hub device or as an external add-on device to the hub.  q. Attachment A - HL7 Integration: The VA Integration specification lists 3 phases. What phases of the VA Integration spec are required from the start as not all have yet been implemented with the VA? What is the schedule for development and deployment of the other phases?  The 3 phases of VistA Integration testing include Emulator, Integration Test Lab and Limited Field testing.  a. All of these testing phases are currently available and operational.q. Attachment A states that VA will provide 60 days advance notice to make the required software changes for any changes to the VA Integration software. Does this mean that we have to design, implement, test and release within 60 days? This is not possible in a medical regulatory compliant design/validation process. It also varies by scope of the requested change. Some requested changes may not even be possible. Perhaps this should be 30 days to understand the required changes, seek clarification and commit a target delivery date.  a. The desire is to contract with vendors who have quality products and are responsive.  Simple vendor server to VA enterprise reporting modifications are expected to be completed in 60 days.  As future changes are more clearly defined, their timelines will need to be discussed.  q. Attachment B - HTH Server Environment: Fault tolerant servers with clustering as a means being specified. While it is common to purchase servers with redundant disks and power supplies to increase uptime, clustering servers significantly increases the costs of operations. For example, to run a clustered database requires two database servers running on a common SAN using a set of Oracle database clustering licenses and SAN clustering software options. This more than doubles the cost of the database systems required in both sites compared to what is in place now. The same applies to application servers and integration servers, where we would need to provide load balancing, twice as many servers and additional application licenses. If all of these need to be clustered then we will have to double the size and cost of our datacenter in both Austin and Hines. Please remove the expectation of clustering or expect to double IT costs and double the VA power and rack requirements. a. Each vendor needs to evaluate their tradeoffs between the additional hardware and software costs, their system monitoring and repair costs and their system uptime impacts.  VA will change the specification to state that local clusters are a desired optionq. The current mechanism being used by the VA to measure responsiveness is inadequate to measure the various types of page performance listed. We need to measure not only time to hit the home page but also login time, worklist display time, and some agreed upon page to page time. This requires proper, commercial web application monitoring tools, with application login capabilities, that are agreed upon by both parties, purchased by both parties, and setup both on the VA and our networks so we have independent data collection for dispute resolution. Please specify the desired commercial application. a. VA has no written program office request or budgeted initiative to enhance the existing response time monitoring tool.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor system response time and upgrade their systems as required.  VA collects basic data to help the VA and the vendor identify and verify that a problem may exist. q. The 98% uptime needs to exclude outages caused by VA network or facility issues or maintenance which today is the lion's share of the issues we see. The 98% must be w.r.t. issues caused by vendor controlled system elements. Moreover the uptime should exclude downtime required to do VA required upgrades or patches. Is this acceptable?  a.  The vendor is required to record and report uptime as described in the specification.  Any variations, unusual situations, exceptions or event explanations could be included in the report.q. The banks of VA phone lines provided needs to span multiple phone numbers in multiple locations with a high degree of redundancy. We currently have over 300 lines just for our system distributed in two different geographic locations and over 8 different systems to be sure that we can meet the demand and connection reliability. Can the VA provide more specifics of the number of lines and their redundancy approach? We also need the specifics of the PPP access protocol used and authentication method to configure in our appliances.  a. The VA assigns multiple phone lines (or T3 channels) to an 800 phone number.  Currently there are  3 availed 800 numbers and 450 free channels or phone lines available to be allocated.  There are separate phone banks at 2 geographically separated locations. You should include any special requirements in you proposal and it will be evaluated as part of the Proposal review process.  VA provides the 800 number and the hardware to pick up the call only. The VA hardware does not authenticate nor does it set the communication requirements. The equipment is merely a relay unit. The Vendor will supply the hardware and specs for the setting the VA hardware,  The vendor server will authenticate that call, validate the traffic and relay the patient data to the receiving server. The hardware currently in place is a Cisco AS5350. Please referrer to the Cisco specs for compatibility with your implementation.q. Attachment C - Security: The VA expectation is that we remain in compliance with the evolving security requirements of the VA as documented in a number of policies and procedures outlined. Does the VA agree to pay for the cost of additional software or equipment necessary to remain in compliance with these standards as they evolve over the contract? For example the policy could change to add intrusion detection in our rack, as opposed to at the VA level, and this would cost us an additional $40,000 to purchase and install intrusion detection devices or firewall upgrades. This has happened in the past.  a. Any requests for an equitable adjustment to the contract for compliance with mandatory VA security changes would need to be submitted to the contracting officer.q. Attachment J - Date/Time and Measurement Rules: It is important to note that no data from a peripheral medical device can ever be considered "accurate" as it cannot be reliably associated with the patient who created it. In the clinical setting this association is done by the care provider taking the measurement. In the home environment anyone with access to the medical device could take a reading and add it into the memory of the device. The medical devices themselves provide no biometric or even username/password to authenticate the user. We typically see the medical device data having a mix of data from the patient and their spouse, which could be approximately the same but trending differently. If the VA insists on the vendor having liability for "accuracy" then we should tag all medical device data as inaccurate on this basis alone. It is always a requirement that upon noting a trend in the telehealth reported data that the care provider assess the patient directly themselves, independently of the telehealth data, to vet the accuracy of the readings and the association of the readings with the patient prior to providing any change in course of treatment. Failing to do so is the care provider's liability.  a. The requirement addresses the accuracy of the measurement date/times and the accuracy of the measurement values, and not user authentication.  Accuracy is vitally important and is very different from the issue of use authentication.  It is the vendor's responsibility to deliver systems that deliver accurate measurements and date/time stamps.  VA marks Home Telehealth data so that clinicians can consider the variabilities in the home environment when evaluating the clinical significance of the data.  If your corporate position is that all data gathered in the home is inaccurate related to measured values and date/times, then you need to state that position in your proposal.  q. Not all medical devices used in the VA have a clock or allow setting of the clock. For those that do if we set the clock in the device based on a mandatory zip code entry for the patient in the database this does not really guarantee accuracy. The zip code could be incorrect (we will have to log the changes the care provider makes to this for liability) or the patient could be traveling with the device and have taken readings in a different time zone. This is particularly important for glucose meters where the patient could have been told to take readings at specific times in the day. Most medical devices do not have time zone capability and are just local time and date. It is not recommended to set the clock for devices that have manual entry of the clock, as the user will be frustrated that the clock is set with a local time for a different time zone from where they actually are while traveling, the user will therefore change it to the correct local time, and then keep having it reset by the appliance. Moreover setting this clock has little value since the readings are still tagged as inaccurate. Is this acceptable?  a. Currently, VA has observed date/times that are inaccurate by years.  Sometimes these dates are years in the future.  While there may be inconvenience for patients who travel, the goal of the requirement is to improve on the current situation.  The VA requirement is to set the time to the time zone of the address of record.  The vendor is responsible for testing their entire systems, including peripheral measurement devices to validate that the entire systems will produce valid data.  Offered solutions are subject to evaluation.q. For devices with manual clock entry we can tag all readings as unreliable as we cannot know that the user did not change and then change back the time prior to connect. At present this means that many of the devices used by the VA will have their readings tagged as inaccurate. All currently supported glucometers and wired blood pressure devices in use allow manual clock entry. Only the A&D Bluetooth medical devices have an internal clock that cannot be user set and that can be system set. The other option is to only allow in session readings, but although this is viable for weight, blood pressure and pulse oximetry devices, it is likely unattractive for glucose which is undesirable to take in session and is typically taken multiple times per day. Glucose meters are a major issue for accuracy and we would like the VA to discuss this with the Glucose meter manufacturers. a. Constructive vendor suggestions and support is desired so that together we can improve on the current unacceptable situation.  These changes may mean that some current conveniences are no longer available. q. Can we use GMT in the medical devices as the time base, and adjust the time zone at the system level? This is easier for medical devices without a time zone concept.  a. Generic statements are difficult to evaluate but the described solution may be viable for some devices.  It would not be appropriate if the device displays the time to the user that is many hour different from local time,  q. One general concern related to tagging measurement readings based on rules such as "weight has changed by 100 pounds" is that the system is starting to exercise medical judgment that is generally not allowed within the indications for use of a Physiological Data Gathering device. This is a liability for the vendor. As an alternative we have provided a means for the care provider to tag suspect readings using their judgment after consultation with the patient. Is this acceptable as an alternative? a. The current systems alert care coordinators when values fall outside specified limits and this is a beneficial function.  Additional types of data review to send alerts to the care coordinators would be valuable and will be considered in the evaluation.  q. Clinical Content, Section 12 Optional Supplemental Special Services FEE VA Standardized Disease Management Protocols for Messaging (HUB Device or IVR):  "This pricing covers the cost of developing new or revised standardized VA Disease Management Protocols (DMP) that have incorporated the required standardized VA content and meet VA's pre-acceptance testing requirements. " Please define for us the "pre-acceptance testing requirements". a. This is an internal VA process utilizing clinical Subject Matter Experts.q. How will translation fees of the DMPs be addressed? a. All vendors will be required to review the specifications for new DMPs and submit development pricing for VA to review .  q. 5th Bullet: "DMPs for co-morbid diseases or conditions may be made available by contractors, subject to all other requirements." Please clarify "all other requirements."  a. As contained in 2.4 and Specification #12q. 6th Bullet:  "The contractor must have a mechanism to ensure that rapid change (within 7 days) can be made to the content of all of the affected DMPs (core or standardized) in the event of a patient safety issue arising due to changes in accepted clinical practice or a problem with existing content. These changes will be made at no additional cost to the VA" Please define patient safety issue and distinguish between patient safety issues and non-patient safety issues.  a. This will be as interpreted by  VA clinicians and administrative staff  in the specific circumstanceq. How/Who determines what is and is not a patient safety issue? a.  VA clinicians and program office staff determine this.q. 2nd Bullet: "Once VA standardized DMP content for a disease or condition is released to contractors, each contractor must make available the standardized DMP content for pre-acceptance testing by the VA within 45 days." What is the process for pre-acceptance testing for minor changes? a. Internal VA review process utilizing Subject Matter Experts.q. Attachment K:  Since the VA has created and is currently testing their own Substance Abuse DMP, why are the current Substance Abuse Guidelines included?  a.  Will delete.q. The COPD Guidelines seem to be missing as a part of Attachment K.  Please forward the current COPD Guidelines. a. Will be attached to solicitation or web link provided.q. Measurement Device ManufacturerSection 2 Specifications, Subsection 3.0 Measurement Solutions for Messaging and Measurement Hub Device. 4th Bullet: "For blood pressure monitors that are not designed for home use, offerors must provide documentation regarding their accuracy." This is a big issue as it could allow certain companies to participate. These companies use a BP module that is not clinically validated for accuracy. Our monitors have clinical validation papers backing up the accuracy of the algorithm. I don't think it is fair for companies who use a BP module to "provide documentation regarding their accuracy" which will most likely be internally generated data.a. Noted.  VA will modify the specification to require devices that are clinically validatedq. 5th Bullet: "Weight scales must include a mechanism for standard calibration within the units."We understand this as referring to the zero out function. We would like to have it also state that this needs to be done at the beginning of each measurement to ensure the accuracy of the reading. If this function is done after the measurement, like a lot of other scales on the market, then how can they claim that the reading that was just taken is accurate? If the scale was moved then the reading may not be accurate if the zero out function is done after the measurement has been taken.a. The VA will modify the specification to indicate a zero out function.q. Blood Pressure: The RFI lists 350 mmhg as the upper range for the bp monitor. The industry standard is 280mmhg for the upper range for all bp monitors. We would request this be changed to 280mmhg to accurately reflect industry standards.  a. The industry standard for cuff inflation pressure limit is 300 mmHg as specified by AAMI/ANSI  SP10:2002.  VA will modify this element.q. Data Services SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES1.c: How is this defined. Is it equivalent if not precisely the same as the current Census data or does it extend to export for research types of ad hoc requests? I think later references are more clear but still not entirely clear. a. See the related Specificationsq. Data Communication And Reporting:  Are these 2 the current VA integration functionality or something new?a. The specifics of the requirement are included in the RFP specification.  There are some new requirementsq. Please provide more information regarding the monthly data connectivity reports.a. The specifics of the requirement are included in the RFP specificationq.14.0 DATA OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS:  Is this a change in policy?  This seems far more stringent than before.a. VA policy is as written q. Customer Service, 2a.MESSAGING AND MEASUREMENT HUB DEVICE REPROGRAMMING AND REFURBISHING FOR RE-USE BY NEW PATIENT: Is the refurbished unit sent back to the  VISN required to have the same serial number as the unit sent in for refurbishment?a. Noq. How should units with etched or permanently marked devices be handled?  a. The requirements for refurbishment will be clarified to include cosmeticsq. Customer Service Requirement for In Home Telehealth Devices for clinicians: These hours are extended from current operations and will require a significant expansion of   staff.  a. Required for adequate customer service for a very large program.q. In the last RFP it basically said that we could not contact patients. It did not say that patients could not contact us. It is not unusual for: a. VA CM to have a  patient contact us. b. VA patients find our contact information on the internet and contact us of their own volition. a. Notedq. Finance/Logistics, Schedule of Supplies:  For Item 1(e) are we required to ship or to only support a Glucose meter? Currently we have no reseller agreement. a. VA will clarify the language.q. Section 1.4 Contract effective date: " These licenses will have an effective period for a full year"  The contract period is only for one year at time.  I would state that the licenses will have an effective period until the end of the current contract period.  a. VA will clarify the languageq. If the license is for one year, why do we have to bill quarterly? a. VA will clarify the languageq.  "In the event patients are managed for less than a complete year". Unclear. What is the definition of provision of care? Being enrolled and assigned to a device?  a. Yes q. Section 2.8 Delivery Requirements: "Regular deliver shall be made within seven (7) days after receipt of a delivery order." There might be issues with holidays for remote areas. Please exclude holidays counting as days. a. VA will clarifyq. Section 2.9, Weekly report of sales: What is the format requirement for this report?  a. Attachment I includes the current description of the report format.q. Section 9.0 Service Data Manual Device: This states that we need to provide TWO manuals for each purchase. We recommend that service data manuals are supplied in electronic version or are ordered as part number. a. VA will clarifyq. 2.0 SPECIFICATIONS, Section 2a. Messaging..refurbishment and : We need to add a clause stating "The equipment must be sent back in original packaging or Contractor provided retrieval packaging.  Any equipment returned in unapproved packaging will not have any work completed that is warranted by the Contractor."  Unfortunately, our appliances are regularly returned with little or no padding which causes significant damage during shipment. a. Noted.  q. Section 14.0  Licenses/Associated Services Fee: Are we charging a yearly fee or quarterly? It stated earlier that licenses will have an effective period for a full year (Section 1.4 Contract Effective Date) "purchaseswill be made at a local level." From 2.3. I would request that for Quarterly billing of Licenses, the payment is due 45 days from the date that the data is sent to each "local level". Currently it takes far more than a quarter to collect the money. Some facilities say they have to bill on a patient level, this assumption should be cleared. a. VA will clarifyq. What is meant by "The level of fee will vary according to the technology and the components"?  a. VA will clarifyq. "VA will calculate the number of patient days of actively deployed device/service every 3 months." Is the definition of actively deployed device/service equal to enrolled and assigned device? As soon as a device is active it is calling in on a daily basis. a. VA will clarifyq. Attachment L - Warranty, Section 6. Original: The warranty shall include parts, labor and shipping to and from the contractor. Contractor will provide a replacement within 5 business days of notification. (contradiction with 4.3?). Proposed: The warranty shall include parts, labor and shipping to and from the contractor. Contractor will provide a replacement within 10 days of receipt of the allegedly defective equipment after a test is performed that confirms the defect. If the allegedly defective equipment is confirmed to be functioning as originally intended, the unit will be sent back  to the VA.  a. VA will review this item q. Account Management, SCOPE OF CONTRACT AND STATEMENT OF WORK, Section 2.3:What constitutes "VA requires Veteran patients in CCHT programs to exchange clinical and administrative data bi-directionally with VA clinicians on a daily basis."?a. VA desires that patients respond with the requested data/response items daily as assigned by the care coordinatorq. Page 11 Regarding page load times: Must patient panels be limited to 150? a. No upper limitq. May the load times be longer if the panels have more than 150 patients? a. Noq. 4.3.g: If we replace a unit and the "defective" unit is not returned, when should we bill for it?  After 30 days? a. Replacement units should be sent once the defective unit is returnedq. Specifications, 12.0 "Within one year after contract award,": Please include more detail about data elements being requested. a. As noted, this is yet to be specifically determined.  Details and instructions would be provided with advance notice to afford implementation.q. Will a device?free, IVR platform approach to telehealth should be given a separate award for at least one vendor under the same procurement vehicle currently under consideration.a. The SOW does include the option for separate award for a stand- alone Interactive Voice Response system.  We will clarify the wording under 1.0 Schedule of supplies, paragraph 2: "Line item 6 can be considered a separate option from the required items 1-1e."q. Section 1.0 Schedule of Supplies (page 2): What is the specification for a server? For example, is this an individual rack of multiple CPUs or a single CPU?a. The RFP contains the server specifications, i.e. section 6.2 and attachment B.  Using multiple computer systems containing multiple CPUs is a common way to meet the requirements. It is desirable to limit the physical space requirements for the servers at one site, so a one rack solution is desirable.q. Section 1.0 Schedule of Supplies, 3e (page 4); A stethoscope is listed as a mandatory device in the Messaging/Measurement/Video Telemonitoring Measurement Solution category. For a vendor that has a telehealth solution with video conferencing capability, but does not support a stethoscope as a peripheral device, would the VA consider modifying the RFP so that the stethoscope is a desirable rather than mandatory requirement? If not, would the VA consider a vendor proposal that did not have a stethoscope but met all other requirements? Would the vendor be allowed an implementation period after contract award to meet this requirement? Or, is the vendor disqualified from award consideration if they don't meet this requirement at the time of submission of a proposal?  a. VA will consider making this an optional feature. Availability of this feature and any timeline for availability will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. Section 1.2 Purpose and Objectives (pages 6-7): If a vendor has a specific new product feature (one that is listed as desired, but not mandatory in the RFP) that is currently on the product development roadmap but is not commercially available at the time of writing a proposal in response to the VA RFP, should the vendor include the product and/or feature description in their proposal with an understanding it will be available in the product within a certain period of time after the award?  a.  No q. Or, should the vendor leave that feature or product offering out of the proposal completely?  a. Yes  q. If left out, once a vendor has received an award on this contract, are there opportunities outside of the new contracting period to add new features and/or products to the vendor's contract with the VA under this award? a. Upgrades, new accessories or software may be submitted for consideration under technology refresh guidelinesq. Along the same line of questioning, if there is a mandatory specification that the vendor doesn't currently meet but has plans to release that specification commercially within the next 12 months, can the vendor still apply for the contract award or would missing a mandatory specification automatically disqualify the vendor from consideration? a. Disqualifyq. Are the vendors managing the servers in the VA data centers, or are the servers managed by VA IT personnel, or both?a. The vendors are responsible for managing their servers in the VA data centers.  If the vendor does not have that capability, the vendor could contract with another entity to manage the servers.  q. Section 1.4 Contract Effective Date (page 7): Is the 12 month licensing fee for a product only billed at purchase or can the license fee be billed quarterly?  a. VA will clarify this itemq. Please clarify the requirement for setting up the backup datacenter: is it 115 or 120 days? If a vendor's system does not currently support data center mirroring, is the VA willing to work with the vendor for a period longer than 120 days to set up the backup data center in the event that problems arise and the vendor is not able to complete the work within the specified period of time? a. Section 4.4 states that "This testing is to be accomplished within 120 days of the award."  Section 1.4.1 b will be changed from 115 to 120 days.q. Section 2.3 Home Health Technologies (pages 10-11): If a vendor's product does not currently delineate whether data was entered by the patient vs. data captured by medical peripheral devices, is this a requirement that the VA is willing to make optional rather than mandatory?  a. No q. Or, is the VA willing to give an implementation period for the vendor to meet this requirement after contract signing? a. The vendor should propose the features they currently have in production and propose specific timeframes for delivery of additional features.  q. Is VistA HL7 integration a mandatory requirement that must be available at contract signing? a. Attachment A states "At a minimum, contractor systems must have HL7 messaging capability in field testing by the end of the first 6 months or the contract would be terminated.q. If a vendor has release plans to support this capability within the calendar year, but it is not commercially available at the time of the vendor's proposal, would this disqualify the vendor from consideration for an award in response to the RFP?  a. No q. Or is the VA willing to provide an implementation period after contract award for the vendor to support this capability? a. Yes, but the vendor must have the feature available for testing and implementation in the timeframes required in the specifications q. Can  you provide a technical specification on the HL7 application interfaces the VA has implemented? a. The RFP contains the VA Home Telehealth HL7 implementation specification as an embedded document in "Attachment A- HL7 Messaging Capability" q. Section 2.7 Data Communication and Reporting (page 13): Is the VA willing to provide an implementation period after contract award for vendors to add VA specific data elements to standard reports or to create any custom reports required by the VA?a. Yes, give specific timelines in your proposal.  An acceptable timeframe would be within 3 months of award.  q. Section 3.1 Information Technology (IT) Requirements, 1e (page 14): If a product does not currently support Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW), is the VA willing to give an implementation period after contract award for the vendor to implement this capability? a. Yes, attachment D states "Within 3 months of award, the new contractors will submit CCOW compatible clinical data management software to the VA for testing"q. Section 3.1 Information Technology (IT) Requirements, 2b (page 15): What is the specific time requirement for "immediate" delivery of individual patient survey responses electronically transferred to VA system? (ie. what is the VA's definition/specification for "immediate"?)  a. The VA goal is to receive the responses in real time.  The transmission of the survey responses should be sent to the VA when the completed responses are received from the veteran.  They should not be bundled and batched for later transmission.  Short delays due to traffic congestion are acceptable.q. Section 1.0 Messaging and Measurement "Hub" Device Hardware (pages 20-21): 1.4 Is Verdana an acceptable sans serif font?  a. Verdana is acceptableq. 1.8 If a vendor's telehealth product is not self configuring, is this a requirement the VA would be willing to make desired rather than mandatory requirement? a. No, the home devices must be easy to install and useq. Or, would the VA be willing to allow an implementation period for the vendor to deliver this capability after contract award?  a. The vendor must be able to produce documentation and to demonstrate the proposed self configuring device when their proposal is submitted and when the product is demonstrated during the evaluation.  For any capabilities that are not immediately available, the vendor should propose specific timelines for the delivery of these capabilities as commercially available products.  This will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. Section 2.0 Software that Supports the HUB Device and the Servers in the VA Data Center (Attachment B) (pages 22-23): 2.8 The ability to add custom fields to support the VA's categorization of patients is work that would need to be done by vendors after a contract is awarded.  Is the VA willing to consider making this an optional requirement or allowing for an implementation period after contract award for vendors to meet this requirement? a. The vendor must document and demonstrate any required and defined capabilities that are part of the patient or care coordinator interface, i.e. levels of care.  The vendor should propose specific timelines the delivery of any other capabilities (or features that are only generally defined) that are not immediately available.  This will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. 2.12 If a vendor does not provide all of the sorting and aggregating patient data displays and reports exactly as described for the VA, is the VA willing to allow for an implementation period after contract award for a vendor to implement these requirements? a. The vendor must document and demonstrate any required and defined capabilities that are part of the patient or care coordinator interface. The vendor should propose specific timelines the delivery of any other capabilities (or features that are only generally defined) that are not immediately available.  This will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. 2.17 Having two fields available for customer assigned patient identification numbers is another custom feature for the VA that vendors would need to enable if a contract was awarded. Is the VA willing to allow for an implementation period for a vendor to enable this capability after contract award? a. The vendor must document and demonstrate any required and defined capabilities that are part of the patient or care coordinator interface The vendor should propose specific timelines the delivery of any other capabilities that are not immediately available.  This will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. 2.19(c) Is it acceptable to provide the archive for threshold history and individual identity in a separate database from the telehealth system? Does the VA implement a separate database to archive this historical information? a. The specific intent of this question is not clear to the reviewers. The vendor should propose specific details of any archiving plan as well as timelines for the delivery of any archiving capabilities that are not immediately available.  This will be considered during the proposal evaluation process.q. Section 6.0 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MESSAGING/MEASURING/VIDEO TELEMONITORING DEVICE INCLUDE (page 26): 6.6 What is the specification for high definition picture clarity? a. This requirement will be clarified.  The intent was not to obtain HDTV, but to avoid very poor quality video clarityq. Will this specification be a mandatory or optional requirement?  a. Adequate video quality will be defined and will be mandatory.q. Section 12.0 OPTIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL SPECIAL SERVICES FEE VA STANDARDIZED DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS FOR MESSAGING (pages 32-34): Would reporting DMP revision changes via system log files be an acceptable method to support this requirement?  a. The VA standardized DMPs will not change frequently (i.e. once or twice a year versus weekly).  For these DMPs, log file changes would not be sufficient.q. Does the VA have a separate system to archive this data or is this a requirement of the telehealth system database?  a. The VA currently has a system that stores all versions of surveys and all the patient responses.  For DMPs, the VA has plans to develop a system or expand the existing survey system in order to store all versions of VA standardized DMPs and selective responses.  The vendor must also maintain a correlation between the patient responses and the DMP questions that were current at the time the veteran submitted their responsesq. Attachment B - Home Telehealth Server Environment (page 39): Can you provide the list of approved VA virus protection software?   a. Yes.  McAfee AV and ISS Proventia HIPS protection are currently both used for signature virus protection and Intrusion prevention.  Other packages are acceptable but each vendor must request and receive approval to use their proposed virus protection software. q. Attachment E - Patient Survey Response Transmission Specification (page 47): Is it mandatory or optional for vendors to support the electronic delivery of these surveys? a. Mandatory q. If a vendor's system did not support the delivery of these surveys because of the length of some of the specific questions or the numbers of responses to choose from (6 possible answers), would the vendor be disqualified from consideration for an award under this RFP? a. Yes, they would be disqualifiedq. Can IVR and/or Video Conferencing hardware (telco and servers) be locatedoutside the VA firewall?a. No, any system that includes/stores any patient specific information cannot be located outside the VA firewall.

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to obligate a total of $210,103 for the Bond-n-Bond Navajo 046 LUST Site Work Assignment Amendment. This work will require the contractor to conduct site assessments and site characterizations, and perform corrective action for potential leaking underground storage tanks (LUST) sites in EPA Region 9. The contractor will conduct groundwater monitoring and sampling activities (four rounds of sampling per year), unless modified by the EPA WAM. For the purpose of estimating costs for groundwater sampling, the contractor assumes that 16 existing wells will be on a quarterly basis (7 quarters). The contractor will install up to 4 additional groundwater monitoring wells to fully delineate the groundwater impacts at the site, if necessary. If field conditions require additional wells, the contractor will make a recommendation to the EPA WAM. The EPA WAM will determine if additional wells are needed. All existing groundwater monitoring wells will be included in the quarterly monitoring events. If applicable and justifiable, all existing wells will be refurbished for sampling. If the wells have to be abandoned, the contractor will follow all appropriate Federal and Tribal standards. If field conditions require additional groundwater monitoring wells, the contractor will make a recommendation to the EPA WAM. The EPA WAM will determine if additional wells are needed. Following each groundwater sampling event, the contractor will develop and submit to EPA and the Tribe a Technical Memorandum (Tech Memo). The Tech Memo will detail the groundwater sampling activities and present findings and recommendations. The contractor will transport all investigated-derived waste (IDW) materials and associated items from off the site to an approved offsite facility. The contractor will subcontract out the containerization, transport, and disposal of all IDW.</p>

<p>The purpose of this announcement is to proclaim that the Work Assignment Amendment is to obligate a total of $280,885 in Recovery funding to perform this requirement at the site.<br />The general requirement of the work assignment is to: Review of previous site assessment, corrective action, and pilot study work performed; Submission of final design of the air sparge (AS)/soil vapor extraction (SVE) system; Obtainment of all necessary permits from local, tribal, and federal agencies. Installation of AS/SVE wells and remedial system; Install security fencing; Submission of monitoring plan describing start-up activities and operations and maintenance of the remedial system; and Performance of monthly operations and maintenance on the remedial system as recommended by the manufacturer. Work will be done at the Zephier Video &amp; Gas LUST site, located on the Pine Ridge Reservation in Kyle, South Dakota.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Underground Storage Tank (OUST) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OUST contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OUST contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

(place "X" in (Ippropriate box and complete rest afform)
X FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) - The item is peculiar to one manufacturer (e,g., a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a
product, peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is
an item peculiar to one manufacturer.
Explain why the brand name i em is essential for the acquisition. Describe the rationale for the brand name specification,
Ordering activity shall post th rationale for the brand name along with the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to e-Buy
(http://www.ebuy.gsa.gov). A!though competition should exist among schedule providers ofthe item, this authority shall be
used for a brand name purcha e.
Page 1
FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) - Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work.
Explain what makes this FSS contractor the only responsible source, i.e., Does this proposed FSS contractor have facilities or
equipment that are specialized and vital to the effort? Is the proposed contractor the only one that can meet critical schedules?
Does the proposed contractor have prior experience of a highly specialized nature vital to the effort? Does the FSS vendor
have an exclusive licensing agreement? Why won't any other product or service satisfy the need? Describe market survey
and analysis efforts leading to this conclusion.
FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) - The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that
the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures (8.405-1
and 8.405-2). The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures.
Explain why the work is a logical follow-on and provide information on the original competition for the first order.
FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) - An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in
unacceptable delays.
Explain why the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the government
would be seriously injured unless it limited the number or sources. Solicitation from as many potential sources as is
practicable under the circumstances is required.
9. JUSTIFICATION
A. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED FSS CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF
THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORiTY CITED.
The SAS Software products were purchased and integrated into the IRS security infrastructure by the Computer Security Incident
Response Center (CSIRC) several years ago. The IRS relies on multiple security vendors with intrusion detection system (IDS)
sensors placed throughout the enterprise to provide a robust security architecture and defense in depth. The SAS Software is a critical
component of the existing IRS security infrastructure and integrated with existing processes, procedures, and other technologies.
Without this renewal of existing SAS Software components, the IRS will not be able to meet IRS federal mandated monitoring and
intrusion detection requirements. Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 10.8.1.4.3.2 requires that intrusion methods be configured to have
system-wide detection capabilities and utilize automated features for attack detection and reaction. IRM 10.8.1.4.3.2 also requires
intrusion detection systems be updated with new indicators/signatures made available by Treasury CSIRC (TCSIRC); the SAS
Software has already been implemented to meet these requirements and must be renewed.
The SAS Software is sold by multiple vendors off the Federal Supply Schedule. This requirement will be competed amongst those
vendors.
B. DESCRiBE THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH (E.G.,
SEARCH ON E-LIBRARY AT HTTP;//WWW.GSA.GOV/FSS; HISTORiCAL ORDERING INFORMATION, FEDBIZOPPS
SYNOPSIS). SYNOPSIS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR FSS PROCUREMENTS, BUT MAY BE USED. ALSO, LIST ANY FSS
SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN WRiTING IN THE ORDER AND THE RESULTS OF THAT INTEREST.
The brand name rationale and the requirement will be synopsized on GSA's e-buy as a brand name acquisition. Prior to the original
selection of this product, the IRS conducted market research and evaluated other IDS products including McAfee, Juniper, and
Internet Security Systems (ISS).
C. LIST THE ACTIONS THE BUREAU WILL TAKE TO PROMOTE FSS ORDERING PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN FAR
8.405 ON ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR SIMILAR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES.
This requirement is sold by multiple resellers and this acquisition will be competed using FSS ordering procedures.
D. STATEMENT THAT REQUIREMENT DOES NOT RESULT FROM A LACK OF PLANNING OR THE EXPIRATION OF
FUNDS.
This requirement does not result frorn a lack of planning or the expiration of funds.
