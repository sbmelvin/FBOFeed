<DESC><p>TITLE: USAF Electronic Warfare Battle Management Technology Search
<p>DESCRIPTION: The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Development Division (XRS) is conducting market research analyses in support of examining technology levels and potential system availability to provide an initial capability for EWBM during operations conducted by USAF components of the DoD Airborne Electronic Attack System of Systems (AEA SoS). ASC is issuing this CRFI to gather information in support of any potential Air Combat Command (ACC) investment in such technology during a future (undefined) programming cycle. Only responses from US companies will be accepted.</p>
<p>This request is for information and planning purposes only. In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) the Government is conducting Market Research. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information you provide. In accordance with FAR 15.201 "Responses to these notices are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract." However, information may be used, not attributed to a particular Respondent, as a basis to engage with appropriate USAF organizations to inform and solicit programmatic support.</p>
<p><br />Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive". Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy for any future ACC EWBM program. It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analysis of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel. All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information. The Government's support contractors will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements prior to being granted access to your data. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.</p>
<p><br />APPROACH: ASC/XRS is requesting information on viable options that will provide an initial capability for EWBM during operations conducted by USAF components of the AEA SoS. Please note that while information sought for this CRFI is primarily concerned with optimization of USAF components of the AEA SoS, responders are encouraged to provide information on applicability of their EWBM technology to USN, USMC, USA and coalition capabilities that may be considered part of a surface, sea, and Airborne Electronic Attack SoS.</p>
<p>Air Combat Command states the following EWBM tasks are applicable to all phases of conflict: Detect, Develop, Decide, Direct, and Assess. These tasks are accomplished via the enablers of Integrated Planning, Connectivity, Information Assimilation, and Decision Management. Respondents are asked to provide information on any existing system or any upgrade/concept/idea capable of being fielded in the near-term (2015 IOC) that provide capabilities/enhancement to the specific enablers of Integrated Planning and Decision Management. It is understood that in order to adequately accomplish EWBM tasks via these enablers, additional requirements such as low latency, high bandwidth communications systems may be required. This CRFI welcomes identification and bounding of such issues but does not seek information on solutions for those. Responders should provide information on methods to meaningfully 1) fuse and display existing/available electromagnetic spectrum data, 2) automate the target/weapon pairing process, 3) automate the course of action (COA) development process, 4) perform COA assessment and recommendation, and 5) assess planned and/or accomplished electronic attack effects. Where applicable and possible, information regarding the System Data Exchanges (SDEs) and functionality of a solution set should be provided and correlated with the Information Exchange Requirements (IERs) and activities contained within the AEA SoS Architecture. The overall objective is to improve the efficiency, reduce the time required, and minimize the potential for unintended consequences in the application of AEA during all phases of combat.</p>
<p>Responders are asked to provide solutions that would upgrade/modify existing USAF ground and/or airborne systems, a response for a new stand alone system, or any combination of these solution sets. If multiple solutions are presented, each distinct solution should be fully documented as a complete response. The intent of this CRFI is to assist ACC with information needed to establish/refine operational requirements and set priorities for possible implementation of EWBM. The goal is to identify new and existing technology investments capable of optimizing AEA SoS effectiveness at both the component and SoS levels, in order to improve execution of all assigned missions. This CRFI seeks information on all aspects of EWBM as applied across all phases of combat.</p>
<p>Wherever possible and practical, the utilization of open, digital, modular, scalable, sustainable and common architectures is encouraged. The responder's recommended solution(s) should include an implementation schedule for the development, procurement, and installation of possible solutions to include risk assessments and technology readiness levels. The goal is to develop a range of promising options at several capability and affordability levels.</p>
<p>The technical solutions requested by this CRFI are comprehensive and, in some cases challenging. The Air Force is looking to industry to identify solutions that address the bulk of them, but there is no assumption that one company can satisfy them all. Therefore, companies that have partial solutions are encouraged to respond and address the extent to which their solutions provide answers to the technology challenges presented by this CRFI. This feedback provides the Air Force with insights into what is readily available and where the Technology Readiness Level is for solutions that can meet these challenges. It also provides an indication of what operational needs are most critical to costs and technical performance.</p>
<p>To aid in the evaluation of affordability, rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates should be provided.</p>
<p>DATA LIBRARY: The government will provide an electronic library (e.g. CDs) for responder's accessibility to government furnished information (GFI) data/documents. This information includes:<br />- (U) EWBM Gap Analysis results<br />- (U) AEA SoS Architecture Description and products<br />- (U) ACC EWBM Concept</p>
<p>Information related to EWBM tasks, enablers, and functional concept is available in the government's data library and will be made available upon request from industry. Company responses should clearly indicate the solution(s) it is addressing and include a cover letter and a narrative summary of their approach as well as other pertinent data. Responses should include sufficient information (such as a plan of action and milestones) that describes how the recommended technologies/system would be fielded to provide an initial EWBM capability.</p>
<p>Responses to this CRFI must be received No Later Than 1500 (EST) 17 July 2009. Request for Information responses may be submitted electronically or regular mail, but require both electronic and hard copies of responses. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size in accordance with the size standard; ensure that the company name, address, a point of contact with e-mail address and telephone number, Federal CAGE Code, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. No collect calls will be accepted. Responses (UNCLASSIFIED and CLASSIFIED up to SECRET) should be sent to:<br />ASC/XRSC, 2275 D Street<br />Bldg 16, RM 0053<br />Wright-Patterson AFB 45433-7224</p>
<p>For information classified at other levels, please call to determine handling and applicability to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Questions should be directed to Bob Matthews [robert.matthews@wpafb.af.mil] (973) 255-8419 or Rod Leighner [rodney.leighner@wpafb.af.mil] (937) 255-8449.</p>

<DESC>GCSS-AF is an Electronic Systems Center initiative to meet total systems integration and operations for Operations Support net-centric infrastructure, although over time that infrastructure will blend or merge with C2ISR infrastructure. The GCSS-AF infrastructure will also support some Joint or other military service operations and over time enterprise services may be eliminated or merged or adopted from other military services or the DoD. Target focus is the continued operations of GCSS-AF infrastructure on the NIPRNET and SIPRNET, evolution of GCSS-AF's Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and continued high velocity delivery of infrastructure, data services, and fused, cross-functional war-fighter capabilities. Work will be accomplished as required at Hanscom AFB, MA, DoD locations and facilities throughout the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii and various facilities overseas. Temporary and extended overseas travel (more than thirty days) may be required.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), CDC, NIOSH, Pittsburgh, PA, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to FLIR Systems, Inc. for a High Resolution InSb Altair Industrial Package.
<p>a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. The purpose of this contract is to purchase an Infrared (IR) camera also referred to as a thermal imaging camera for use in current and future research projects. The IR camera will be used to support scientific research on healthcare worker PPE for pandemic influenza. Specifically, the IR camera will be an invaluable tool under Project BREATHE to conduct research on respirators. Prior NPPTL research has indicated IR technology is capable of determining the presence of leaks, evaluating fit, and measuring the increase of facial temperature while wearing a respirator.</p>
<p><br />Project BREATHE (Better Respirator Equipment utilizing Advanced Technologies for Healthcare Employees) is a collaborative effort between the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S., and NIOSH to identify and integrate new and advanced technologies into respirators utilized by HCW. This project addresses respirator issues such as proper use, clinical effectiveness, communication, comfort, tolerability and compliance leading toward the development of improved respirators that will result in enhanced protection. The IR camera will be imperative in the research on proper use, comfort, and tolerability issues</p>
<p>b. Nature of the acquisition and proposed unique qualifications of the contractor(s). Based on our evaluation of systems on the open market, we have selected the FLIR Systems SC5600MB MWIR 640x512 camera system. The SC5600MB MWIR is the only system that meets all of our application requirements for accurate and quick thermal inspections and real time analysis needed for the evaluation of human subjects wearing respirators. The SC5600MB MWIR will expedite testing and data analysis of a range of variables, but most importantly this specific camera provides the highest thermal sensitivity and data capture rate currently available. These two features allow us to monitor real time human subject data and measure precise changes in temperature both of which are required to conduct this scientific research. In addition, FLIR Systems is the leading manufacturer of this type of equipment in the world. Additional technical requirements that can only be met by the selected IR camera include:</p>
<p><br />&bull; The camera system must be sensitive to radiation in the 3 to 5 micron wavelength range. <br />&bull; The camera must have a staring focal plane array with at least 640 x 512 InSb pixels. <br />&bull; The camera system must have a 40MHz pixel clock for high speed imaging.<br />&bull; The camera must be able to operate at 100 frames per second in full frame. It must have windowing capability for increased frame rates.<br />&bull; The camera must have at least 14-bits of dynamic range and output digital video with snap-shot readout.<br />&bull; The camera system must have both Gigabit Ethernet and Camera Link digital outputs.<br />&bull; The camera system must allow for simultaneous analog and digital video at all available frame rates.<br />&bull; The camera system must be cooled via a closed-cycle Stirling cooler. External cooling mechanisms like LN2 are unacceptable.<br />&bull; The camera must have an array with a minimum format: 640 H x 512 V, Pixel Size: 15 x 15 microns with an Optical Fill Factor: greater than 90%.<br />&bull; The camera must be capable of advanced triggering with user selectable delays.<br />The SC5600MB MWIR is the highest performance equipment available and is the only system that meets all of our application requirements. In addition, NPPTL currently owns an IR camera, which is now obsolete, manufactured by FLIR systems. Data collected previously using the existing IR camera will be compatible with the new IR system. <br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Reference number 2009-Q-11346, CDC NIOSH, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with FLIR Systems, Inc., 25 Esqyire Road, North Bullerica, MA 01862 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a cost reimbursement type contract to evaluate hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity among US-born adolescents who received hepatitis B primary vaccination series during early childhood. Vaccination against hepatitis B (HB) starting at birth is safe and highly effective in preventing chronic HBV infection. Studies of children vaccinated with plasma-derived vaccines, available since the early 1980s, have shown protection from the vaccine to last at least 20 years. A number of investigators believe this immunity may be life-long, but actual determination of duration and magnitude of this immunity, including in persons who do not respond well to vaccination, can only be determined as current cohorts of adolescents who were immunized as infants enter periods of higher risk for HBV infection. Since the late 1980s, recombinant HB vaccines have gradually replaced plasma-derived vaccines such that within the next few years, plasma-derived vaccine will have been almost completely phased out globally. Routine use of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine has been widely implemented only in the last 15 years or so, and as a result there are limited data on long-term protection among those vaccinated beginning at birth in countries of low HBV endemicity. Therefore, the major tasks to be completed under this contract include:<br />1) To evaluate lasting immunity against hepatitis B provided by vaccination received during early childhood (i.e., all 3 vaccine series should have been received within the first 9 months of life)<br />2) To evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing HBV infection by testing for relevant serologic markers.<br />3) To evaluate whether natural boosting from exposures to HBV has an impact on the duration of hepatitis B vaccine-induced immunity by analyzing anamnestic response among Whites vs. Blacks.<br />4) To identify potential risk factors associated with failure to respond to a booster dose of the hepatitis B vaccine<br />The CDC anticipates a period of performance of two years. This is not a Request for Proposal. The intention of this notice is to notify potential offerors that Solicitation No. 2009-N-11287 will be available for download on the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before May 15, 2009. This will be a full and open competition. Additionally, all amendments and responses to questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. All questions must be submitted in writing to Sharon Cunningham at Sharon.Cunningham@cdc.gov orJulio Lopez at Julio.Lopez@cdc.gov. All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov. No telephone calls will be accepted. It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to continually view the website for any amendments made to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to University of Washington, Children's Hospital &amp; Regional Medical Center, 4800 Sand Point Way, NE, Mailstop B-5520, Seattle, WA 98105. The purpose of the contract is to obtain data on the incidents of rotavirus in children &lt; 5 years of age and the vaccination rate associated with those incidents. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the fact that only Seattle Children's Hospital had sufficient number of rotavirus cases to perform the described activity. In 2008, no other sites had identified rotavirus cases besides the proposed vendor. Identifying rotavirus cases-patients during the current 2009 rotavirus season is crucial to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Maria Shamburger by email at heg9@cdc.gov</p>

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub L 111-5, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. In accordance with FAR 5.704, Publicizing - Preaward, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to existing Department of State task order SAQMMA08F3448 under Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract SAQMPD07D0068 with Edgesource Corporation, 901 N. Washington Street, Suite 402, Alexandria VA  22314.

The project description is as follows: provide information technology support related to the cyber security training program in support of the Information Assurance Branch (IAB) of the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DTSC).  Tasks include course analysis, gap analysis, planning, technical support, course delivery, course coordiantion, and course development.

The original order was awarded as a competitive task order in the Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Business (SDVOB) set-aside pool between the two Department of State Hybrid Information Technology Services for State (HITSS) SDVOB contractors. The rationale for using other than a fixed-price approach is that the level of effort for the required IT services depends on variables that were not known prior to task issuance and neither the Government nor the Contractor were able to estimate the extent or duration of the work with any reasonable degree of confidence. Because of the uncertainly of the work, a fixed price task order could not be reasonably negotiated and only a labor-hour contract could be reasonably awarded.

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Intermec PM4I Printer.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST has identified the Intermec PM4I Printer as a key component to Passport agencies.  Per the manufacturer, the PM4i is an industrial printer designed to excel in demanding applications and environments.   The PM4i printer acts as a "smart client" executing user-defined programs.  The PM4i printer eliminates the personal computer, operates additional hardware (e.g. scanners, other printers, conveyors), accesses information from network host, and retains the ability to change as needed with the application for additional functionality. When using the wireless option for the PM4i, any attached peripheral devices also become part of the wireless infrastructure.  Furthermore, there are up to five interface ports that can be used simultaneously. The PM4i includes serial, parallel, USB, internal ethernet, and wireless. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
The specific brand and model is required due to Passport specific hardware code interface and compatibility.   Software used to print out the Passport customer labels is hard-coded to work with Intermec label printers.  Several different models have been tested, but only one will interface correctly with the software application.  
Both brand name and specific part number are crucial to the software compatibility.  As well, Intermec no longer sells this specific model with upgraded memory which is required.  The memory module is sold separately by the manufacturer.  However, the memory must be integrated into the printer prior to delivery to the Passport site (or temporary holding area). The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST/DO requires Netbackup 6.5 licenses as they are used to support the new Classnet system.  It includes storage licensing for the 5 TB virtual tape library as well as the current M1500 physical DLT tape library that will be in use at CSTs offsite copies.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.
Symantec Veritas Netbackup is the only effective license and support for the system.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

This solicitation is un-restricted, and is to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562111 and the size standard is $12.5 million dollars.  See explanation of size standards at the following website: http://www.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/index.html.  This procurement includes Option periods.  The performance period will include a 12-month base period, four 12-month option periods, and five 12-month award option periods for a total maximum duration not to exceed 120 months.  THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVAL! UATE OFFERS AND AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFERORS (EXCEPT CLARIFICATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN FAR 15.306(A)).  THEREFORE, THE OFFERORS INITIAL OFFER SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERMS FROM A PRICE AND TECHNICAL STANDPOINT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER LATER DETERMINES THEM TO BE NECESSARY.  IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER DETERMINES THAT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE EXCEEDS THE NUMBER AT WHICH AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION CAN BE CONDUCTED, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER MAY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THE COMPETITIVE RANGE TO THE GREATEST NUMBER THAT WILL PERMIT AN EFFICIENT COMPETITION AMONG THE MOST HIGHLY RATED PROPOSALS.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  ! Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) and price.  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are approximately equal to price.  The importance of price will increase if offerors' non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal's technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  The evaluation factors are set forth below:Factor 1: Corporate ExperienceFactor 2: Technical ApproachFactor 3: Management PlanFactor 4: Small Business Subcontracting EffortFactor 5: Past Performance and Safety of Offeror and Offeror's Team	Sub-factor 5A: Past Performance	Sub-factor 5B: Safety of Offeror and Offeror's TeamPrice
Offeror shall submit its proposal in two (2) separate parts as follows:
1) Technical Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Address each of the following evaluation factors shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation: Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5.
2) Price Proposal: (original & 4 copies).  Include all other Price Proposal submission requirements shown in FAR Clause 52.212-2 of the solicitation.  Price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder from the technical proposal, and clearly marked "Price Proposal."  Offerors shall complete Exhibits A through K, Option Periods 1 through 4, and Award Option Periods 1 through 5.  OFFERORS SHALL COMPLETE ALL EXHIBIT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (ELINS) UNIT PRICES AND TOTAL AMOUNTS IN THE BASE YEAR, FOR EACH OPTION PERIOD, AND AWARD OPTION PERIOD.    
While all proposed pricing will be fully evaluated in accordance with the RFP price evaluation criteria, the Government will consider only the sum total of the prices proposed for the following Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs) to determine reasonableness, realism, and completeness for the purpose of performing any required cost-technical trade-off analysis to determine the offeror proposing the best value to the Government: 
Base Year: FFP (ELINs A001 through A065)IDIQ (ELINs A100 through A115)Option 1:FFP  (ELINs B001 through B065)IDIQ (ELINs B100 through B115)Option 2:FFP  (ELINs C001 through C065)IDIQ (ELINs C100 through C115)Option 3:FFP  (ELINs D001 through D065)IDIQ (ELINs D100 through D115)Option 4:FFP (ELINs E001 through E065)IDIQ (ELINs E100 through E115)Award Option 1:FFP  (ELINs F001 through F065)IDIQ (ELINs F100 through F115)Award Option 2:FFP  (ELINs G001 through G065)IDIQ (ELINs G100 through G115)Award Option 3:FFP (ELINs H001 through H065)IDIQ (ELINs H100 through H115)Award Option 4:FFP  (ELINs J001 through J065)IDIQ (ELINs J100 through J115)Award Option 5:FFP  (ELINs K001 through K065)IDIQ (ELINs K100 through K115)
In the event there is a difference between a unit price and the extended total amount, the unit price will be held to be the intended price and the total of the ELINs will be recomputed accordingly.  If the offeror provides a total amount for an ELIN but fails to enter the unit price, the total amount divided by the ELIN will be held to be the intended price.
AN OFFEROR WHOSE PROPOSAL IS ACCEPTED FOR AWARD WILL BE FIRMLY BOUND TO ALL OF ITS PROPOSED PRICING LISTED ABOVE WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY REQUIRED COST-TECHNICAL TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS."

<DESC>Section 105 of Public Law 110-385 requires the Office of Advocacy to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of broadband speed and price on small businesses.  The Study must also include the following :
a.) a survey of broadband speeds available to small businesses;
b.) a survey of the cost of broadband speeds available to small businesses;
c.) a survey of the type of broadband technology used by small businesses; and
d.) any policy recommendations that may improve small businesses access to comparable broadband services at comparable rates in all regions of the Nation.

The Office of Advocacy seeks a contractor to assist it in conducting this study. The Office of Advocacy will also attempt to assist the contractor in obtaining access to non-proprietary FCC and other agency data, should such assistance be needed.

<SUBJECT>Benefits Offset National Demonstration (BOND) Implementation and Evaluation 
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-09-1060
<RESPDATE>080309
<CONTACT>Brenda E. Monch, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659521, Email brenda.monch@ssa.gov - Dawn Caracci, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-965-9465, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the implementation and evaluation of a Benefits Offset National Demonstration (BOND), which will rigorously test several versions of a new program for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and concurrent beneficiaries against status quo policies and against each other.  The contractor will be responsible for implementation and evaluation of the project and perform continuous analysis of data throughout the contract.  

As part of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Congress mandated the SSA conduct a demonstration project testing a program under which Title II disability benefits are reduced, or offset, $1 for $2 above a specific amount of earnings.  SSA moved forward with this Congressional mandate by competitively awarding design contract number SS00-04-60110 in 2004.  This contract stated that upon successful completion of a design, SSA would award an Implementation and Evaluation contract to the design contractor on a sole source basis.  Contract #SS00-04-60110 ended in September 2008 and SSA is ready to implement and evaluate the $1 for $2 demonstration project.

We have now concluded that “successful completion of the previous contract” does not meet any of the exceptions in the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA).  Additionally, the President issued a Memorandum on March 4, 2009 directing Executive Agencies to make every effort to use a competitive process for contract awards.  We have thus determined that a sole source contract award based upon previous contract performance is no longer appropriate.  For all of these reasons, we will award the Implementation and Evaluation contract through a competitive procurement process.  

This requirement will be procured using procedures from Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.  SSA anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with a period of performance of nine years from date of award. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720, with a size standard of $7.0 million. Solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1060 is scheduled for release on or about June 19, 2009, with proposals due 45 calendar days thereafter. The following website is provided, which includes all deliverables under the design phase of this program, describing the plan to be implemented and evaluated:  
http://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/Benefit%20Offset%20National%20Demonstration%20(BOND)%20Design%20Documents.html

Do NOT contact individuals identified in the deliverables.  All questions must be submitted in writing to the contract specialist via email after issuance of the solicitation. The solicitation will be available for downloading from the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED. Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>PLEASE CONTACT Mr. Edward Aleszczyk, Electronics Engineer, (732) 532-9320 FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS<BR><BR>DESC This is a Market Survey to extend CECOM-LCMC Contract W15P7T-07-C-L001, which was previously awarded to Raytheon Company (Raytheon), 1801 West Hughes Drive, Fullerton, California 92833. The extension period will consist of three twelve month options commencing from November, 2011 until October, 2014. The current contract is a five year contract for the depot and field level overhaul and repair (O&R) services, field maintenance support, and engineering services for the AN/USC-28(V) Satellite Communications Set (SCS), and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) Electronics Counter-Countermeasures Control Subsystem (DECS)-Central Component (CC)/DECS Remote Component (RC). In addition this acquisition will also continue to provide resident site support (fault isolation, corrective action, engineering support and testing) through Field Maintenance Technicians (FMTs) for the subject equipments.  The FMTs will support site personnel which are required to maintain fielded systems worldwide. The Contractor's Systems Engineering Staff will provide analytical support to the FMTs on-site problems and duplicate and suggest corrective action for system anomalies reported by the FMTs. In addition all Depot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul and redeployment required to correct said anomalies will be accomplished. The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package which would be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems and anomalies, furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes that availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete technical data package) necessary to provide the detailed Depot level and site engineering support for the systems for which this contract is intended. A respondent must be able to prove to the Government how Depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings. A written response must include evidence of the respondent's ability to support the described equipment by writing to Commander, USACECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-COM-S-DN, Building 1202, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000.  For more information contact Mr. Edward Aleszczyk, (732) 532-9320. Deadline for response is JUNE 19, 2009. Posted 06/04/09.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Western Coastal & Marine Geology Team (WCMG), Menlo Park, CA has a requirement for services to compile and analyze physical oceanographic data sets off the Palos Verdes, CA coastal shelf created by the USGS, and other governmental agencies. This requirement will be completed in two phases.
Phase One:  The contractor will work with the WCMG research staff to obtain all relevant physical oceanographic data for the project from local sources, and then convert those data sets, as necessary, into USGS netCDF data formats.  The contractor will examine the several data sets collected at the same time, but at different locations to determine the joint characteristics of the data and use those characteristics to determine if there are problems with data quality.  In particular, the contractor will use the several vertical profiles of currents collected by the various acoustic current sensors and statistical methods based on Matlab scripts to determine if and how adjustments will be made to individual compass sensors within those instruments.  A report will be written and delivered in electronic format to the project leader that describes the basic characteristics of the data set, procedures for fixing the discovered errors and possibly other elements, as determined in collaboration with the project leader.  Estimated time frame for Phase One is 80-100 hours. 
Phase Two:  Based on the findings above, using the physical oceanographic data sets, the contractor will lead projects with USGS researchers to analyze products and reports relevant to this project to:.  1.	Determine the spatial structure of near-bottom wave orbital velocities as a function of the frequency and direction of the surface wave.  Possibly calibrate a model that uses wave measurements from offshore buoys to predict the wave climate on the Palos Verdes shelf during times that local measurements do not exist2.	Use Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses to determine the spatial and frequency structure of the sub-tidal and or tidal flow fields over the Palos Verdes shelf as a function of height of the measurements off the sea bed3.	Use statistical and spectral analysis methods to determine the effectiveness of wind stress in forcing currents as a function of frequency and height of the current off the seabed4.	Determine whether there are significant changes in the characteristics of the bottom boundary layer when internal bores are present on the shelf
The potential projects above are samples of the analysis products needed to predict contaminated sediment movement on the shelf.  Exact selection of data projects and the time frame for product development is dependent on a determination after completing Phase One.  Estimated time frame for Phase Two is 1250 to 1300 hours.
The potential vendor must be familiar with the netCDF data formats for physical oceanographic data sets and be skilled at using computers and the Matlab language in order to develop needed analytic and statistical products from the various data sets.  The contractor must be familiar with data records from various physical oceanographic instruments including, but not limited to, temperature/salinity sensors, various Acoustic Doppler Current sensors, both single point and profiling, wind sensors, acoustic and optical water clarity sensors and wave property sensors.  The contractor must have a Bachelor's Degree in science or engineering and at least one year of graduate work in physical oceanography and at least 10 years experience in quality control and analysis of physical oceanographic data sets, including, but not limited to spectral analysis, time series analysis, modal analysis and other advanced statistical analysis methods.
The USGS Request for Quote (RFQ) 09WRQQ0125 will be made available through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about June 5, 2009, IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1). All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Anticipated award date is 25 June 2009.
This requirement is not anticipated to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912DQ08D0036.<br><br>RECOVERY  Task Order Information:  Bonneville Stilling Basin Erosion Repair:  Repair of erosion and undercutting in the north apron of bays 2-3.  A series of large erosion holes exists on the downstream edge of the concrete apron on the north end of the spillway. In 2008, divers measured the undercutting with a 25 probe; however the probe was not long enough in some areas to measure the undercutting. The extent of the undercutting is unknown but estimates show as much as 25% of the basin rock that supports the apron is gone. A soft green clay layer transverses this area. Repair of erosion holes in bays 9, 12 & 14. There is approximately 4 to 5 feet of concrete missing from the ogee floor at Bay 9. Bays 12 and 14 showed similar amounts of removed concrete. Bay 14 appears to have more concrete removed (as much as 6 feet) at higher elevations on the ogee. There is about 5 feet of concrete missing in Bay 9 directly above the downstream drainage gallery of the spillway. The as-built drawings indicate 10 to 12 feet of unreinforced concrete coverage above the drainage gallery. John Day Downstream Lock Gate Replacement: The John Day Lock downstream lift gate is a single leaf gate that has no redundancy. The John Day Lift Gate is a welded steel structure with 24 arch frames and a top plate girder spanning horizontally between the concrete lock towers.  The upstream side of the gate has an integral 1-1/8 inch thick steel plate which contains the upstream pool. John Day Flow Deflectors:  The work to be performed under this project consists of providing the labor, equipment, and materials to construct a flow deflector in the tailrace of the John Day Project as shown on the contract documents.  To perform this work, the area will need to be dewatered to a depth of about 55 feet using existing stoplogs and fabricated guides.  This includes removal and reinstallation of Avian Deterrent Array cables that will be required for tailrace access to the new deflector location. The work also includes relocation of Top Spillway Weirs (TSW) at the spillway at the John Day Project.  Relocation of the TSW's and the spillway stoplogs must be performed by a barge crane.  The work consists of fabrication, concrete demolition, anchor installation, mass concrete placement, work over water, dewatering, avian array removal and reinstallation, barge crane work, diving, and other miscellaneous tasks to complete the work as defined in the contract documents.  <BR>

The vendor shall provide results of Ground Evaluations to verify the maintenance concept, fitting procedures, and in-cockpit pre-flight checks. The vendor shall provide results of Operational Tests with a variety of USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft. The vendor shall provide results of Flight Evaluations to verify operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness with USAF transport, fighter, and rotary wing aircraft.</p>
<p>The vendor shall demonstrate production capability by fabricating and providing a minimum of 30 production representative devices with statistical process control (SPC) data (i.e. yields, control charts, Pareto analyses) which verifies the production processes are sufficiently mature, stable and in control for FRP. The vendor shall provide data that confirms the Block 2 ALEP product is affordable and readily producible. Current qualified source is: Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging.</p>
<p>Proposed delivery of LRIP totals 470 units and is to commence four months after receipt of modification for a three month period. Proposed delivery of FRP totals 8500 with a minimum of 150 units per month. A proposed period of performance is approximately 57 months.

Hardware includes Hewlett Packard (HP) servers, workstations, and monitors; non-HP routers and switches; and interface computers requiring support contracts with third party vendors for hardware sustainment. The HP hardware will be under warranty for the first nine months of the anticipated contract. Technical Order documentation and updates will be required for equipment undergoing configuration changes. The anticipated contract will require a contractor to provide services to plan and manage logistics for the previously described hardware by ensuring the following locations have an appropriate level of spare parts on site at four U.S. sectors: Eastern Defense Sector (EDS) near Rome, NY; Western Defense Sector (WDS) near Tacoma, WA; Hawaii Region Air Operations Center (HIRAOC) near Oahu, HI, and Alaskan Region Air Operations Center (AKRAOC) near Anchorage AK, a System Support Facility (SSF) at Tyndall AFB, FL, and HP hardware at the Canadian sector (CADS) near North Bay, Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Current sustainment is via an Interim Contractor Support contract with the BCS-F prime contractor supporting approximately 183 items. In 42 months of operation of similar BCS-F Increment 2.X equipment in the same operational environment, there have been 289 total failures of 51 unique items, with the maximum number of items being shipped in a month being 15 and the minimum being 3.</p>
<p><br />1. Please describe your company's experience providing the requested services under the job description in paragraph 1.</p>
<p>2. Please describe any experience your company has in establishing subcontracts with third party suppliers of repair services as an OEM.</p>
<p>3. Please describe any experience your company has in producing documentation or updating Technical Orders.</p>
<p>4. Please describe your company's understanding and incorporation process of the Department of Defense Unique Identification (UID) requirements for military parts/equipment.</p>

<p>7. Please describe your company's experience dealing with or identifying Form, Fit, and Function or Interface (F3I) replacement to LRU's, and their integration into the system due to DMSMS issues.</p>
<p>8. Describe your company's capability and experience with supportability and sustainment of a system that is comprised of a high percentage of COTS items.</p>
<p>9. Please describe your company's experience with providing technical assistance and troubleshooting of hardware issues in support of the customer.</p>
<p>10. Please describe any experience your company has providing technical refresh recommendations.</p>
<p>11. Describe your company's experience dealing with items that still have OEMs warranties and recommendations for possible extension of those warranties.</p>
<p>12. Should your company be awarded the Contract Logistics Support (CLS) for support of the AN/FYQ-156, please describe a notional time frame that your company needs to begin performing the functions described above.</p>
<p>13. Please provide any additional information you feel would assist the government in determining your ability to support this type of workload.</p>

<DESC><p>Set aside: Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HUBZone, Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns that may be interested in performing a contract for the IHS - Four Corners Regional Health Center.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of Navajo Area Indian Health Service (IHS).</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this procurement has not been finalized and is subject to change based on the responses received from the sources sought notices. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought notice or otherwise pay for information solicited herein.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 221310, which applies to industry primarily engaged in Water Supply and Irrigation Systems.</p>
<p>The following information is provided to assist the Indian Health Service in conducting Market Research of Industry to identify potential contractors for this effort.</p>
<p>Statement of Work - Electro coagulation Arsenic Removal System Pilot Test for the IHS - Four Corners Regional Health Center (FCRHC) Facility Domestic Water Supply</p>
<p>The current domestic water supply for the IHS - FCRHC and associated quarters is out of compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for arsenic. The arsenic level of the water delivered to the FCRHC facility is currently averaging 22 parts per billion (ppb) and the EPA's current arsenic MCL is 10 ppb. The current arsenic MCL was implemented in February 2006 after the EP's research showed that the then current arsenic MCL of 50 ppb allowed unacceptable chronic exposure risks. Since the facility was designed and approved prior to the reduced arsenic MCL mandate, no provisions for arsenic removal were included in the FCRHC project requirements.</p>
<p>Water chemistry can vary dramatically from one domestic water source to the next. Depending on the pH and the combination of minerals dissolved in the water, the most cost effective water treatment strategy used meet the EPA's mandated MCL's can change from one type of technology to another. To verify that these different technologies being marketed for water treatment are safe and effective, the EPA has created the "Environmental Technology Verification" (ETV) testing and certification procedure. Prior to selling equipment for use in public water systems for reducing EPA regulated contaminants, equipment suppliers must receive an EPA ETV verification report showing that their equipment has been tested and meets the EPA's standards for removing specific regulated contaminants.</p>
<p>A successful bench-scale test of an elect coagulation (also known as electrofloculation) treatment system has been shown to reduce the arsenic level in the sample of domestic water from the FCRHC facility that was tested. To generate the construction and operating data required for an on-line, full scale system, and on-site pilot test is needed. A portable and self contained small scale water treatment plant designed and instrumented specifically to generate this information is needed to be brought on-site for a test to provide this data.</p>
<p>The proposed pilot test requirements are outlined below:</p>
<p>The contractor will provide all necessary equipment and manpower for a pilot test using a self contained EPA verified arsenic removal system at the FCRHC. The contractor will locate the system near the FCRHC mechanical room in the parking area, which is accessible by transport vehicles. The required utilities will be provided by the Government to the contractor for the duration and purpose of the test at no cost. All water quality analysis required during the pilot test will be provided by the contractor. All water analysis for the pilot test will be completed by an EPA certified water analysis laboratory and all analysis results will be available to the Government upon request.</p>
<p>At the completion of the test a report will be provided by the contractor to the Government that will provide:</p>
<p>An accurate equipment list for a full scale water treatment facility sized to treat all domestic water used at the Four Corners Regional Health Center;</p>
<p>An accurate account of electrical requirements for the full scale facility;</p>
<p>Water recovery rate (percent of backwash water required);</p>
<p>Treatment cost of the water per 1,000 gallons of water treated. This includes the cost of all utilities, consumables, and expected service contract cost;</p>
<p>Expected sludge quantity and composition per 1,000 gallons of water treated, and;</p>
<p>Recommendations for construction and operation of the facility, particularly regarding the disposal of the sludge.</p>
<p>As a separate submittal, proposals to supply all or part of the equipment for the full scale treatment facility and a proposal for an annual service contract for the operation and EPA certification of the facility are also required.</p>
<p>All reports will completed and delivered to the FCRHC Facilities Manager within 3 weeks of the completion of the test. After delivery of the final report(s), the contractor will profile at least one individual knowledgeable about the water treatment systems and the pilot test results for one day of meetings about the proposed water treatment system. The meetings will be held at Red Mesa, Arizona or Window Rock, Arizona. The contract will be given at least 5 days notice prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, tools, transportation, material, equipment, and supervision necessary to provide electro coagulation water treatment system for arsenic remediation in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, standards, instructions, and commercial practices at Four Corners Regional Health Center located in Red Mesa, Arizona.</p>

<a href="mailto:elaine.m.scarnici@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The U.S Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PMFSS), Natick, MA is conducting a market survey to identify potential vendors for furnishing modification kits and associated logistics support documentation to upgrade approximately 800 Food Sanitation Center (FSC) Model FSC-90.  The FSC-90 is portable and includes three specialized sinks, each of which is heated by an open flame, JP8 fuel-fired burner.  This facilitates a 3-step process to sanitize Army field kitchen equipment such as pots, utensils, and insulated food containers.  The FSC-90 is housed within a standard military tent and includes ancillary equipment such as drain hoses, drying racks, and tables.  The purpose of seeking the modification kit is to upgrade FSC-90s, which were fielded prior to 2006, to the same standard as the latest model FSC known as FSC-2.  PMFSS is researching potential vendors who may be able to design and fabricate FSC modification kit components such as heavy-duty sinks; carbon monoxide monitor assemblies; 20 gallon per minute grease separator assemblies; small pump assemblies; heat shields for hot surfaces; miscellaneous hoses; and electric cable assemblies.  PMFSS anticipates the fabrication work will include, but not be limited to, metal working, welding, thermoplastics forming, electrical assembly, mechanical assembly, integration, testing, packaging, and crating.  PMFSS does not have a standard drawing package for FSC modification kit components, so the vendor would need to design/build to a performance specification and then verify performance through detailed testing.  PMFSS also anticipates the work would require the vendor to develop its own fabrication drawings to facilitate production and quality control.  In addition to design and fabrication efforts, logistics support and configuration control documentation would be needed from the vendor to assure the Army can sustain the kits without vendor support.  Logistics support documentation would include technical manual and training packages in standard Army format.  Configuration control would include drawing packages and management of configuration changes.  This notice also seeks information regarding potential vendors quality assurance programs.This market survey is intended for Government planning purposes only and responses are voluntary.  This notice is not an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal.  For those parties interested in submitting a response, the information is required within 14 calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Information should include 1) experience in designing/building/testing to performance specifications; 2) experience developing logistics support documentation, fabrication drawings, and configuration control documentation; 3) quality assurance program; 4) fabrication capabilities; and 5) vendor status as a small or large business.  Information shall be limited to no more than three (3) pages with no smaller than font size ten (10) and at least single-spaced.  Page size shall not exceed 8.5 x 11.  Responses to this notice shall be emailed to Jeff Wallace, PMFSS, (jeff.wallace@us.army.mil), for additional information, contact Jeff Wallace at 508-233-6098.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Kansas City District has been tasked to provide Turbine Blade Repair at the Stockton Powerplant, Stockton Lake, Stockton, Missouri. Magnitude of this project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.<BR><BR>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis.<BR><BR>Stockton Power Plant is located in Stockton, MO and has a single turbine-generator unit.  The turbine is an adjustable 6 blade Kaplan unit, with a runner diameter of 280 inches.  In February 2009, one of the Kaplan blades broke off.  It is obvious from the tracks on the crack plane that the crack originated at the leading edge of the blade and progressed to the downstream blade palm/trunnion area.  Approximately three quarters of the blade broke off.  <BR><BR>It is estimated that the broken blade section weighs approximately 15,000 pounds.  The blade section has been located in the bottom of the draft tube.  Repair operations have not started to date because the intake gates and draft tube bulkheads have not passed safety inspections or required repairs.  The time and effort needed to perform these inspections and repairs is unknown at this time, however, it is hoped that the inspection and repair work will be completed such that the unit can be unwatered the last quarter of 2009.  Blade repair work will commence at this time.  <BR><BR>Outlined below is our basic scope and sequence of the blade repair work.  All comments, advice, and suggestions on the feasibility of this scope of work is encouraged.   Your comments will be considered as we develop plans and specifications for the work.  A contract will be advertized and competitive proposals (or bids) will be accepted and evaluated for completing this work.<BR><BR>Outline and Sequence of the Work:  <BR><BR>   The Corps of Engineers (COE) will:<BR>                Take samples of the blade and perform a chemical analysis.<BR>                The broken blade section will be made available to the contractor in the powerhouse erection bay.<BR><BR>   The Contractor will:<BR><BR>Define the weld preparation grooves for the broken blade section.<BR><BR>Be responsible for having the blade prepared for welding, including all weld grooves and bevels.  It is assumed that the weld prep will be performed on the blade prior to it being re-inserted in the draft tube.<BR><BR>Define the weld procedures (subject to COE approval).<BR><BR>The COE will install the intake gates and draft tube bulkheads and dewater the unit.  The COE will be responsible for maintaining the unit in the unwatered condition.<BR><BR>The Contractor will:<BR><BR>Create templates of the proper blade shape from one of the existing turbine blades.<BR><BR>Use chain falls, jacks, etc. to lift the broken blade section from the bottom of the draft tube into position so it can be welded onto the stub/trunnion section still in the runner hub.<BR><BR> Install the Government furnished draft tube work platform and reinforce the existing platform or fabricate a new platform if needed to facilitate work (subject to COE approval).<BR><BR> Weld the two blade sections together.<BR><BR>Maintain the original blade shape using the templates made from one of the intact turbine blades.<BR><BR>Complete 100% PT on all 6 runner blades and perform weld repair on identified cracks (subject to COE approval).<BR><BR>Remove any temporary lifting lugs or other brackets, tooling, etc. that were welded to the turbine runner, blade, or draft tube.  Grind flush and restore the surfaces to their original contour.<BR><BR>COE points and questions regarding this work:<BR><BR>The broken blade section weighs approximately 15,000 pounds.  Will it be possible to lift (or jack) the bladed section into position without disassembly of the turbine?<BR><BR>Are there any concerns about being able to achieve the proper blade contour and position (matching the template shape) after welding?   What is a reasonable out of position tolerance at the trailing edge? 1 to 2 inches is being considered. <BR><BR>The COE is planning on replacing the turbine runner within the next 5 years if funding is available, therefore, additional scab plates and reinforcing may be considered (although not desired).<BR><BR>Weld procedures with proper pre heat will be required for this work.<BR><BR>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811310  Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment (except Automotive and Electronic), SIC Code 7692  Welding Repair and the small business size standard is $7,000,000.00.  <BR><BR>If additional technical information is required, please contact Bonnie Lowe at  bonnie.b.lowe@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>Per the direction of FAR 4.5  Electronic Commerce in Contracting, The Federal Government shall use electronic commerce whenever practicable or cost-effective.  Therefore, responses to this announcement shall be sent via email to bonnie.b.lowe@usace.army.mil.  Responses via FAX or traditional mail will not be accepted.  <BR>   <BR>If a solicitation is released in connection to this requirement, vendors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for an award.  Firms can register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  For further questions or concerns regarding CCR, please contact CCR assistance at (888) 277-2423 Monday through Friday from 08:00 to 18:00 (EST).  Potential vendors must also complete their online representations and certifications.  To do so requires CCR registration, including an MPIN number.  Instructions for the Offeror Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) may be obtained, and required information may be entered at http://orca.bpn.gov. <BR>This sources sought notice is solely for the Governments use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.

Failure to respond to this notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  <BR><BR>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT OR AUTHORIZATION TO INCUR COSTS IN ANTICIPATION OF AN AWARD.  THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT BOUND TO MAKE ANY AWARDS UNDER THIS NOTICE.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSLOUIS STOKES CLEVELAND MEDICAL CENTERVISN 1010000 Brecksville RoadBrecksville, OH 44141-3204JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL TO PROCUREUSING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-2.JUSTIFICATION1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.  The Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 10000 Brecksville Road,  Brecksville, OH 44141-3204, Visn 10 Contracting Activity.2.	Nature/Description of Action.This activity proposes to procure an undefinitized purchase order with the American Red Cross Greater Cleveland Chapter (DBA Cleveland Red Cross CAGE: 1TJL6) for three months of blood bank services (e.g. blood supply and blood testing services) under decentralized authority to the using agency.  This procurement provides a temporary solution to ensure continued critical blood bank services until a new contract can be awarded.   The draft contract is currently under review.   The period of performance is June 1 - June 30, 2009.  3.	Description of Supplies/Services.This requirement is to allow the Cleveland VAMC's Pathology & Laboratory Management and Surgical services to maintain the level of patient care services required by the Medical Center's Quality Assurance Management.  An adequate supply of blood and specialized blood testing services provided by a third party vendor is required to maintain surgical operations and allow clinical staff to treat emergency or urgent care veterans that present themselves the medical center.  The estimated per month cost is not to exceed $139,000.00.  This funding is for the period of performance of June 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009.4.	Identification of Statutory Authority.The statutory authority permitting URGENT AND COMPELLING procurement is FAR 6.302-2.5.	Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above:Description of contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:American Red Cross Blood Bank has been the sole provider of these services.  This service is necessary to perform testing and data analysis as well as use in surgery in the Laboratory and Medical Services.  The services are necessary to provide quality service for veterans at the VA Medical Center.  The service is for direct patient care.  Patients are being affected because they are the recipient of the blood either for transfusions, tests, and surgery.  The departments must have blood on call for the various reasons mentioned above and can not store enough on station for this purpose.  This presents an urgent and compelling need to continue these services with the only known vendor until the contract is completed.  Failure to procure blood bank services for the hospital would threaten the health and well being of veterans-patients.6. Federal Business Opportunities  (Fedbizzops) Announcement/Potential Sources.This requirement will not be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(2).7. Determination of a Fair and Reasonable CostThe Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on price analysis of previous purchase 541-C90517 $139000.00. 8. Description of market survey.Initial market research has determined that the VA's has utilized only the incumbent vender in the past few years.9. Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition:None.10. Sources expressing an interest:None.11. Barriers to full and open competition:This is a temporary procurement to continue performance of a vendor during a new solicitation for the same service.Certifications:COTRThe assertions and recommendations in support of the justification have been reviewed and concurred by:_______on file___________________________			____________________Kristine A.

They must be suitable for operation in the existing locations and at the range of temperatures expected at Hoover Dam.
The response to this RFI should include:1.	Name, address and contact information of party submitting a response to the RFI.2.	Description of vendor capabilities and commercial terms and conditions.3.	Comments, suggestions, questions related to the existing circuit breaker drawings.4.	Comments and recommendations on the draft specification that will assist Reclamation in the development of a specification/SOW that will provide for optimum competition among commercial sources and enhance the Government's ability to obtain quality, commercially available, non-proprietary breakers, at reasonable prices.5.	Best practices for the design and specification of commercially available circuit breakers for hydro-electric power plants such as Hoover Dam.6.	Description of technical challenges and approaches to achieve the above goals.7.	Product data, drawings, etc. of commercially available circuit breakers for hydro-electric power plants.8.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Julabo USA of Allentown, PA for the purchase of Julabo LH-45 Temperature Control Bath to be used in the Center for Neutron Research at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
The Sole Source determination is based on the need for the Julabo LH-45 Temperature Control Bath with temperature control to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. 

The NIST Center for Neutron Research does basic materials research that is useful for many basic and applied science disciplines including biology, chemistry, condensed matter physics, polymer research, etc. The purpose of this procurement is to increase the number of temperature baths used for sample temperature control on multiple neutron scattering instruments. These temperature baths are all the same so that they may be interchanged as necessary and so that their controls are familiar for the group of scientists employing them. The objective of this procurement is to purchase a Julabo LH-45 temperature control bath, along with providing options for the future purchase of this same item.

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) presently has three Julabo LH45 ultra-low refrigerated circulators that have a working temperature range from -40 to 250 C. These are all used on neutron scattering instruments for control of the sample environment. The NCNR is a user facility serving approximately 1000 unique guest researchers per year, putting a great emphasis on the reliability, uptime and standardization of our equipment. The Julabo has proven to be very reliable, capable, and fast. The reasons that we wish to purchase this Brand Name Only item are:  1) to maintain a consistent equipment interface for local and guest researchers; 2) to serve as a drop-in replacement spare; and 3) to prevent duplication of effort that would be required to integrate a new system.

 Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 423730, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. (EST) on June 19, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to janet.lamb@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>Under authority of Public law 105-391 (Section 418) the National Park Service announces the limited availability of a Commercial Use Authorization (CUA) for the following service: guided tours on the inspection walkway beneath the New River Gorge Bridge.  One competitive CUA will be issued based the following evaluation criteria: resource protection, ability to operate safely, past performance, relevant experience, qualifications and experience of key personnel, reasonableness of rates, and business capability.
The New River Gorge Bridge is within the National Park Service boundary of the New River Gorge National River but is owned and maintained by the West Virginia Department of Transportation as part of the controlled access right of way for U.S. Route 19.  With a length of 3,030 feet, the Bridge was for many years the longest bridge in the world of its type.  The arch extends 1,700 feet and carries U.S. Highway 19 over the New River at a height of 876 feet, making it the highest vehicular bridge in the Americas, and the second-highest in the world.  The inspection walkway underneath the road provides a unique and engaging perspective of the resource and an experience unlike any other in the United States.
All New River Gorge National River guided tour activities must begin and end outside of the Park boundary, are for the incidental use of park area resources, and may not authorize solicitation of customers, sales or payment for commercial services to take place within the park area: all of these activities must occur outside of the park area.   All applications must be received no late 4:30 pm (EST), Monday, July 6, 2009
Further information and a complete application package may be obtained by contacting: Paul Menard, (304) 465-6521, paul_menard@nps.gov, New River Gorge National River, P.O. Box 246, Glen Jean, WV 25846

The proposed period of performance for this effort is one year from date of award.  

The authority for negotiating on a sole source basis with Knovel Corporation is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a noncompetitive purchase order to SafeNet, Inc. 1655 North Fort Myer Drive, Suite 1150 for upgrade and maintenance of SafeNet Security Management Encryptors.

This purchase will be made as an Other than Full and Open Competition as authorized by 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The anticipated award date is  June 2009. This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The justification for this sole source procurement is only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is a continuation of existing services in support of existing “SafeNet” hardware.  The vendor has to be SafeNet because the hardware already in the production network is from this vendor.  Therefore,  the network management server software would have to be from the same vendor.  If  ENM was unable to upgrade the SMC they would be unable to support the customer in their encryption requirements in a timely fashion as well as any future requirements.


Market Research was not conducted because  this is a continuation of existing services so no other vendors were considered

<DESC>This is an Industry Day notice for an upcoming Future Naval Capabilities program on Flight Deck Thermal Management.  Deployment of the new Navy/Marine Corps aircraft has caused ship flight deck buckling on amphibious ships from the excessive heat impact from engine exhaust plumes.  Studies have indicated that repeated deck buckling will cause premature deck failure.

The goal of this workshop is to provide: (1) some details for potential offerors who would plan on submitting solutions to arrest the thermal impact from the exhaust plumes of new and impending aircraft on Amphibious ships and (2) meet with Navy personnel who will be involved in the flight deck thermal management program.

The solutions will need to mitigate the challenging heat fluxes and loads while also meeting the unique Naval ship and operational environment.  The Navy is seeking both above-deck and below deck options, which are cost effective to install and maintain, and would last the service life of the ship.  ONR BAA 09-031, which is expected to be released around June 30, 2009,  will formally solicit white papers and proposals after the workshop.

Industry Day will be held on June 18, 2009 at the Strategic Analysis Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA  22201 (703-797-4500).   You may access the registration site using the following:  https://www.onr.navy.mil/about/events/regdetail.asp?cid=530&code=4

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a delivery order against a GSA contract number GS-25F-0062L to Xerox Corporation, 1301 K Street NW, Ste 300W, Washington, DC 20005 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is a renewal (3rd year) to an existing contract that will expire 31 Aug 2009 in which the Government is committed to a 5-year lease agreement renewable yearly.  The Xerox DocuColor DC8000 print center is not meant for day-to-day administrative or office use, but rather required training equipment for the U.S. Marine Corps Lithography course being taught at Defense Information School (DINFOS).  Students are required to learn to operate and maintain this particular printing system, and DINFOS Basic Lithography courses’ lesson plan is built based upon it.  The DC8000 is the main component of a standardized and fielded USMC print production system (TIPS).  This system is in use throughout the Corps in deployed areas, and the fixed station print facilities have begun to modernize to this same product.  Leasing equipment, rather than purchasing, allows DINFOS to more quickly react to changes in the field.  Life cycle for these presses would have to be pushed out to approximately 8 years with a purchase (cost factors), whereas, with a lease, they can be cycled for new products at the 5-year point with little or no additional budget impact.

This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).     A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS FOR PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-05-C-0046, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Woodruff/Seminole Site Office, Chattahoochee, Florida, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work: reroof the Site Management Office. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR> <BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 12 recreation areas, three operations areas, the Woodruff/Seminole Site Management Office, Jim Woodruff Powerhouse, as well as all equipment and vehicles to support the effort. 2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor has not only the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  Also, sub-contracts will be awarded as fixed price and every attempt made to award to firms within the area.  In order to meet the requirements of the act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.<BR><BR>

Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work: 1) upgrade campsites to 50 amp electrical service at Eastbank Campground Loop B and Hales Landing, 2), upgrade 11 primitive campsites to electrical utility hookup sites at River Junction Park,  3) connect electrical service to existing bathhouse at Eastbank Campground, 4) install pumps and septic tanks for bathhouse at Eastbank Campground, 5) repair shoreline erosion at Eastbank Campground and Chattahoochee Park, 6) install fish cleaning station and parking area at Eastbank Campground, 7) construct fishing piers at Faceville Landing, Rays Lake, and Chattahoochee Park, 8) upgrade boat ramps at River Junction, Cypress Pond, Rays Lake, Faceville Landing, Reynoldsville Park, Eastbank Campground, and Hales Landing. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR> <BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area.  2) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in 12 recreation areas, three operations areas, the Woodruff/Seminole Site Management Office, Jim Woodruff Powerhouse, as well as all equipment and vehicles to support the effort. 3)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract.  The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.<BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  Also, sub-contracts will be awarded as fixed price and every attempt made to award to firms within the area. Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work. In order to meet the requirements of the act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE.

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Engineering Logistics Center (ELC) has a follow-on requirement for engineering services in support of USCG High Speed Naval Vessel (HSNV) Loads Prediction for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Applications.  The objective of this effort is to integrate existing approaches and analysis tools for hydrodynamic load prediction using the time domain VERES wave loads prediction approach that will ultimately be used for FEA load application for cutter operational envelop definition and hull structural integrity and life maintenance strategies.  The engineering services to be provided include Task 1 – construct a hydro-elastic segmented model; Task 2 – Conduct Model Tests; Optional Task 3 – Data Analysis and Reporting, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work.  The USCG intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Marintek.  It is the Government’s belief that Marintek, Sintef Group, located in Trondheim, Norway is the only contractor who possesses world wide expertise and experience in the application of state of the art analytical and experimental tools for predicting hydrodynamic loads and response to waves.  This expertise is essential for the evaluation of hydrodynamic response and slamming events critical for designing the structural integrity and mission effectiveness of HSNV.  Marintek has developed a proprietary approach for predicting the loading and response of HSNV named VERES that is uniquely suited for the USCG application.  No other sources have the technical qualifications and necessary resources to perform the work described herein, nor will any other services satisfy the Government requirements.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same in duplicate within two (2) working days of this announcement.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  Alternate proposal data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate.  The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses shall be submitted within two (2) days of this announcement.  Responses must be concise and specific to the requirements mentioned above.  The submission of data for review shall not impede award of a contract.

<DESC>May 29, 2009JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 13.106(b)(1) and 6.302-2(b)(1)1. 	The South Texas Veterans Health Care System, Audie L. Murphy Division, intends to negotiate with GE Medical System Information Technologies Inc., 8200 W Tower Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53223-3219 for a firm fixed price Service Agreement IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation competition 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(3) and FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).2. 	The requirement is for services to repair the detector and collimator on the GE Model AMX700 X-Ray Unit.  3. 	The Radiological Unit has a Bona Fide need to procure repair services for the the GE AMX700.  The estimated cost for the repair service is $120,000.00.  4. 	In accordance with 10. U.SC. 2304(c)(3), 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and 6.302-2(b).5. 	This service is required to continue the use of obtaining images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of radiography.  The system has been used on multiple VA patients based on physicians' orders due to certain types of ailments.  This X-Ray model is transportable and is carried to the patient's bedside to have an X-Ray of that particular area. This is a critical requirement as this item is used on the different floors and more importantly in the triage area.  This item is used daily and   to expedite the continued use would keep the hospital patient system flow running at its normal frequency.  The vendor can provide the parts and service in a timely manner.  If the detector is not repairable the vendor will reinstall detector back to the model.6. 	A Combined Synopsis and Solicitation will not be posted in the Federal Business Opportunity System, under FAR authority 6.302-2, due to the bone fide need to the care of VA patients.        7. 	It is anticipated that the negotiated cost to the Government for this procurement will be fair and reasonable.8. 	Market research:  there are no known contracts with the government, and the service required is specific to the manufacturer of the item as they are familiar to the model itself.  Based on my market research for companies to repair GE Models AMX700, there was no one who was listed in GSA or on the internet who had the capability to repair this type of equipment.  As a result of the market research it was determined that only one company could provide the required items, so in accordance with FAR Part 13.106(b) (1) procurement action was initiated.  9. 	Another vendor or repair service provider who may not work on this type model is not justifiable.  It would be technically incapable to have an unknown vendor or service supplier source to work on this mode.  It is justifiable to have the manufacture or supplier whom the item was purchased to repair the model.  This would save the time for the continued use or the product and money based on the need of the required repairable service due to the serviced patients. To alter vendor and/or manufacture would disrupt if not negate patient care.   GE Medical Systems Information Technologies Inc. is a large company, registered in CCR and not on debarred listings.10. 	Only one responsible source is intended under authorities of FAR 6.302-2(b)(1) & (2) and 13.106(b)(1).11. 	I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Technical/Requirements Certification:	I hereby certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of the Technical/Requirements personnel and which forms the basis for this justification is accurate and complete. 	______/s/ Vincente Flores___________________	__5/29/09_______________	Technical/Requirements Personnel Signature	Date/s/							/s/CHARLES TRUMPFHELLER				ELAINE PERALES		Contracting Officer                   				Contracting Specialist            * /s/ original pdf file

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT

C.1 BACKGROUND

National Scenic Byways Research, Assistance and Promotion

Within the U.S. Department of Transportation, the FHWA has lead responsibility for the National Scenic Byways Program. The Program is a grassroots, collaborative effort established to help recognize, preserve and enhance selected roads throughout the United States. The Secretary of Transportation recognizes certain roads as America’s Byways® – All-American Roads or National Scenic Byways – based on one or more archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational and scenic intrinsic qualities.

The law guiding implementation of the National Scenic Byways Program is Section 162, Title 23 of the United States Code; 23 U.S.C. 162, see http://www.bywaysonline.org/program/us_code.html.  The FHWA established the principal policy for the Program in its May 18, 1995 Interim Policy (60 FR 26759), see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1995_register&docid=fr18my95-105.

Under the National Scenic Byways Program, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation designates roads having outstanding qualities as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads.  There are currently 125 nationally designated byways – 98 National Scenic Byways and 27 All-American Roads in 44 States.  

Nominations may originate from any local government, including Indian tribal governments, or any private group or individual.  Nominations to the National Scenic Byways Program of byways on public lands may originate from the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Nominations must be submitted to the FHWA by a State, an Indian tribe, or a Federal land management agency. 

The Secretary of Transportation makes grants to States and Indian tribes to implement projects on highways designated as National Scenic Byways or All-American Roads, or as State or Indian tribe scenic byways.  Projects submitted for consideration should benefit the byway traveler’s experience, whether it will help manage the intrinsic qualities that support the byway’s designation, shape the byway’s story, interpret the story for visitors, or improve visitor facilities along the byway.

There are eight categories of eligible project activities; 23 U.S.C. 162(c):
1.	State and Indian Tribe Scenic Byway Programs 
2.	Corridor Management Plan 
3.	Safety Improvements 
4.	Byway Facilities 
5.	Access to Recreation 
6.	Resource Protection 
7.	Interpretive Information 
8.	Marketing Program 

The State DOT (Department of Transportation) typically is the lead agency for scenic byways at the State level, and the State scenic byway coordinator is a State DOT employee.  In a few States, the State scenic byway coordinator is an employee of the State Tourism department, though the State DOT has lead responsibility for administering National Scenic Byways Program grants.

The FHWA maintains two websites under the National Scenic Byways Program.  The FHWA’s National Scenic Byways Program website, www.bywaysonline.org is the principal medium for doing program business, as well as a primary medium for the FHWA to communicate to the byway community.  The FHWA’s website at www.byways.org is a major medium for the FHWA’s promotion of the collection of National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads as America’s Byways®.

The America’s Byways Resource Center (ABRC) in Duluth, MN was established in 1999 to provide hands-on technical assistance for planning, preserving, promoting, protecting, and managing scenic byways.  The FHWA may continue to work closely and collaboratively with the ABRC in carrying out program activities, technical assistance, and other activities supported under the contract for this Indefinite Deliveries, Indefinite Quantities (IDIQ) solicitation.

Over the years several interest groups have been strong advocates and partners for scenic byways, including the American Automobile Association (AAA), the American Recreation Coalition, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Scenic America, and the U.S. Travel Association.  These partners reflect the broad interests that must be balanced in advancing scenic byways conservation, preservation, economic development, recreation, tourism, and travelers.

Other Federal agencies and State resource agencies, particularly Federal land management agencies also share an interest in scenic byways that provide access or transect National Forests, National Parks, wildlife refuges and other public lands.  Similarly Indian tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs are active in scenic byways that are either on or are accessing Tribal lands.  

C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this contract is to provide readily available support to the National Scenic Byways Program in six task areas:

A.	Technical Assistance and Education
B.	Design, Layout and Production 
C.	Research 
D.	Promotion of America’s Byways 
E.	Conference Sponsorship and Travel Assistance
F.	Financial Management
 
C.3 TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

The contractor must provide expertise in each of the major areas described above under  'Contract Objective'.    

Specific projects and task orders under the IDIQ will be determined on an as needed basis by the FHWA pending the outcome of reauthorization of the National Scenic Byways Program and program need.

C.5 TASK AREAS

C.5.1 Kick-off Meeting, The Kick-off meetings for individual task orders usually last approximately six (6) hours and will include the following attendees:  the contractor’s key personnel, including the Program Manager, the Contract Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), and the Contracting Officer.  
The purpose of the Kick-off Meeting is to introduce the contractor and Government teams as well as to provide background information, clarify course content issues, define roles and responsibilities, establish timelines and respond to questions.  This meeting is generally held at the DOT Headquarters in Washington D.C.. 

Specific work to be performed will be set forth under individual Task Orders.  However, Task Orders will generally consist of work in the following areas:

Task Area A: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION

Background and Objectives

The contractor may be asked to provide expertise and experience in multiple support areas required by FHWA including travel expenses for the individuals providing technical assistance and education activities.

Possible training and education activities will include expertise in areas of grant review, nomination review and designation event assistance, marketing, and education and training.

Discretionary Grants:  

Task Orders may be issued to include, but are not limited to:

-	Develop and use of information and instructions on www.bywaysonline.org and www.grants.gov for grant applications,

Nominations and Designations:  

As part of the nomination process, a panel of six to eight experts from outside the U.S. Department of Transportation assists the FHWA staff in the review of roads nominated for possible designation by the Secretary.  Panel members are selected based on their expertise in particular areas such as historic preservation, visual assessment, cultural or natural resources – combined with their experience in recreation, tourism, transportation, or the overall byway program.  An independent facilitator is used throughout the panel’s deliberations. 

The FHWA completes a thorough review of each nomination package, and compiles information for use by panel members in completing their review.  Panel members provide the FHWA comments and suggestions on routes nominated for national designation.  Using the results of the independent assessment by the expert panel and the FHWA’s internal evaluation, the FHWA staff will prepare a decision package for the Administrator and the Secretary to make the final selections for roads to be designated as National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads.  

The FHWA organizes the designation event. FHWA may also organize and conduct special training and orientation workshops for the byway leaders of each newly designated byway.  See conference Sponsorship and Travel Assistance Task.

F.4 FORMAT FOR DELIVERABLES

At a minimum, the Contractor shall provide all report deliverables in camera-ready hard copy and an electronic copy in Microsoft Office 2003 or equivalent on a CD-ROM(s).  In addition, electronic files containing the word processing, graphic, and table data may be required as deliverables for individual Task Orders.  The Contractor shall establish electronic file transfer capabilities such that correspondence and deliverables can be communicated electronically to the appropriate FHWA Program Office.

F.4.1 All publications funded by FHWA must show the proper departmental “mark and signature” on the front cover, title page, and (space permitting) the spine.  Internet documents must show the mark and signature at the beginning of the document or on the document’s “cover” page.  

The full “mark and signature” must be used, which includes the DOT mark (the triskelion), the Department's name, and the Administration's name.  The Administration's name must appear in bold typeface. The logo may be reproduced in any color that is appropriate to the color themes of the publication, as long as the elements of the color used allow for sufficient contrast to read and understand the sign and accompanying text. The “same color is used for the entire “mark and signature (logo), including the DOT/FHWA names.  The only exception to the one-color rule is the use of DOT blue (Pantone 285) for the triskelion, and black for the text. No other two-color combinations can be used.  The logo may not be rearranged, altered, added to, or edited.  

If the publication is a jointly prepared document, the FHWA logo must appear if FHWA has contributed to the publication.  Logos from other DOT modes or Federal agencies may appear along with the FHWA logo on jointly prepared publications.  If another agency is a co-author, then that agency's seal or logo should appear to the right or directly below the FHWA logo.

F.4.2 Original publication must adhere to generally accepted “Standard Printing Practices” acknowledged by the printing industry.  

FHWA as a government agency uses the Microsoft Operating System (OS). Other operating systems, including Macintosh/Apple are not acceptable as final deliverables. Please deliver all work in MS OS editable file formats.  FHWA supports only Adobe InDesign and PageMaker for print job purposes. It does NOT support Quark Express, MS Publisher, or any other layout/design software for final print jobs.

Graphics to be included in print publications should not be embedded in the design software (i.e. Adobe InDesign, etc.).  All graphic elements must be linked from a separate “links” (or other suitably named) folder.  

Photographs and other graphic elements must be a minimum of 300 dpi for standard print jobs.  Photos and other raster images should be displayed in a publication at the same size (or smaller) than the physical size of the element.  Enlarging raster images will cause pixilation. 

Color used in full-color (process) production must be in CMYK—not RGB. 
All fonts and graphics must be included in the final deliverable.  A separate list of all fonts and linked graphics must accompany the deliverable for printer identification.  

All illustrations are to be done as vector drawings, and all final design and layout deliverables from contractors must include all original source files in their native software configuration.  As with all layout publications, original vector artwork that includes text must also include the original fonts used in the element. Adobe Illustrator is the preferred choice for vector drawings, and Adobe InDesign the accepted choice for print layout applications.  

Adobe PDFs as a substitute for originals are NOT acceptable and should never be used as a final deliverable without the accompanying original files.

In the case that final deliverables include layered raster elements, the original layered version of the element is to be included in the final deliverables statement. The preferred software for layered raster elements is Adobe Photoshop (.psd), or Adobe Fireworks (.png—layered).

The final electronic files for printing shall be delivered to the FHWA on CD-ROMs, or other acceptable media to be determined and agreed upon.  The disk shall include all necessary files for producing the printed document, and be accompanied by the standard GPO Form 952, Desktop Publishing----Disk Information.  

F.4.3 FHWA minimum standards for web page development are:

•	FHWA Web Pages will be encoded to conform to HTML 4.01 Transitional or higher, as defined by the World Wide Web Consortium.
•	File names will not exceed 20 characters in length. File names will be lower case, consist solely of letters, numbers and the underscore and will not contain slashes, spaces, tildes or hyphens. File extensions are to be 3 characters or less whenever possible (i.e. .htm instead of .html).
•	All web pages will have a title in the head section of HTML documents. The title should be unique (to the server), brief, and descriptive - not to exceed 150 characters in length.
•	Web pages must be free of broken links or missing images. All links to pages within the server will be relative.
•	Web pages posted on the public Internet will have a standard header and footer. Web pages posted on StaffNet will use the standard templates.
•	FHWA web pages will comply with Section 508 web accessibility standards as established by the Architectural Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.
•	All textual files posted on the FHWA Internet server will be available in HTML format. All other formats (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) will have HTML equivalents.
•	The bodies of web pages will use sans-serif fonts, e.g., Arial or Helvetica.
•	Internet web pages will feature "exit doors" on links to non-government web sites (anything other than a federal, state or local governments).

F.8 SCHEDULE OF WORK  
  
All tasks set forth in the statement of work shall be performed in accordance with the work schedule as negotiated in each individual Task Order.

SECTION G   CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA
G.1 TASK ORDER PROCEDURE
All funds expended under this contract shall be incurred, accounted for, and invoiced under individual Task Orders.  It is likely that Task Orders will be partially funded initially, and then incrementally funded thereafter as they are needed and become available to the program office.

	It is the Government’s intent to provide all contractors awarded a contract under this solicitation a fair opportunity to be considered for each proposed Task Order in the topic awarded.  The Government expects to issue a solicitation for a Task Order proposal to each eligible contractor asking for a technical proposal and pricing information.  However, the Government may issue Task Orders on a non-competitive basis or limited competitive basis as may be appropriate and authorized by law.  The Contracting Officer will select the offer that is considered most advantageous to the Government considering technical merit of each proposal, key personnel, cost, and past performance on other Task Orders.  Task Order solicitations will specify the evaluation criteria that will be utilized together with a statement of the relative importance of each criterion.  The selection of a contractor to perform a Task Order is generally not subject to protest.  Each Task Order will provide specific information on the work to be performed, the objectives or results desired, a period of performance, deliverables, pricing and other terms specific to the individual Task Order.

The work shall be conducted by the contractor on an as needed basis, within the scope of the contract.  The exact nature and extent of the contractor’s work under this contract will be based upon written Task Orders developed by the Government.  Once work is identified, the Government will issue a Request for Task Order Proposal.  Such requests will be issued electronically.  The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a Task Order Proposal (TOP) within the time specified for submission.  Task Order proposals will normally be submitted electronically and will typically contain: 

1. Discussion of the technical approach for performing the work.
2. Period of Performance and Schedule of Work.
3. Estimated level of effort, types of staffing and number of hours, including those in (5) below.
4. Travel, per diem, equipment and materials estimates.
5. An estimate for subcontractors and consultants, including direct labor hours and cost 
    information if applicable.                                                 
6. Fixed prices
7. Key personnel with their resumes.
8. Experience and past performance. 
                       
The cost for the preparation and submittal of the TOP is the responsibility of the contractor. 
 
 If the contractor is not able, or does not wish, to compete for a specific task order it must so state in writing to the Contracting Officer in lieu of a TOP.  However, contractors are strongly encouraged to make every effort to explore teaming, subcontracting, or other arrangements so as to be able to propose on every offered task order.  Failure to make reasonable efforts to propose on each solicitation issued will be considered under the past performance evaluation factor during source selection. 

G.2 TASK ORDER AWARD

The Contracting Officer may enter into negotiations with those contractors submitting a TOP, and may request a revised TOP, as the situation may warrant.

The Government will evaluate each TOP in accordance with the stated evaluation criteria, and will award the Task Order to the contractor who offers the best value to the Government.

Upon mutual agreement of the parties as to the work to be performed, the schedule, and the pricing, the FHWA will issue a Task Order.  The contractor shall acknowledge acceptance of the Task Order and shall immediately proceed with the conduct of the work.

Task Orders will contain the following information:

1. Name and signature of the Contracting Officer.
2. Contract Number, Task Order number and Task Order effective date.
3. A description of the task including deliverables.
4. Accounting and appropriation data.
5. The negotiated fixed prices.
6. Document and reporting requirements, as applicable
7. Delivery or performance schedule. 
8. Key Personnel
9. Billing information    

G.3 AGENCY TASK ORDER OMBUDSMAN

The Contracting Officer’s selection decision on each Task Order request shall be final and is not subject to protest, except for a protest that the Task Order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.  Accordingly, in accordance with FAR 16.505 (b) (5), an ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of contractor’s concerns resulting from task order award.  The existence of the ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Contracting Officer.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the adjudication of formal contract disputes.  Therefore, before consulting with the ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for resolution.

If the Contracting Officer cannot make resolution, interested parties may contact the FHWA ombudsman, Ms. Patricia Prosperi, at the following address:

Ms. Patricia A. Prosperi
Associate Administrator for Administration/Agency Competition Advocate
HAD-1
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE
Washington, DC 20590
E-mail: administration.fhwa@dot.gov

G.4 TRAVEL AND PER DIEM

Travel and per diem will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Federal Travel Regulations in effect at the time of the travel.  Task Orders will include an estimated cost for travel on a not to exceed basis.  Travel reimbursed under this contract shall be based on the most economical form of transportation available only.  Any costs deemed unreasonable will be reduced to a reasonable amount.  Improper costs will be disallowed and deducted from the invoice.  Any exceptions shall be fully justified and if at all possible, be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer.  All travel shall be scheduled sufficiently in advance to take advantage of available discount rates.

Travel requirements shall be met using the most economical form of transportation available.  This includes using connecting rather than direct flights, and reasonable efforts to insure the most economical flights are secured.  Simply relying on a travel agent may not be sufficient.  If economy class transportation is not available, the invoice must include justification for use of higher class travel indicating dates, times, and flight numbers.

Information on current Federal Travel Regulations and current per diem rates may be obtained at the following web site:

http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC&contentId=17943 

If the contractor purchases non-refundable tickets as a cost saving measure, and then is required to change or cancel the tickets due to causes beyond their control, the contractor may claim reimbursement for service charges.  Unused tickets paid for by the Government must be sent promptly to the Contracting Officer, unless it is likely they can be reissued for a later trip and the company maintains an adequate accounting system to protect the tickets from misuse, and insures the Government will not be billed for the subsequent trip.  Complete justification and accounting must be provided with the invoice.

Saturday night stay over are not required to take advantage of lower fares, but if the traveler chooses to stay over, the Government will reimburse the contractor for the additional lodging and per diem expenses if the reduced cost of the airline ticket offsets these expenses.  Complete justification and accounting must be provided with the invoice.

Use of a rental car shall always be justified, and their use is to be the exception rather than the rule.  Alternate methods of local travel shall be used whenever possible, such as hotel or airport shuttles and taxis.  If using a rental car, your justification must include the distance from the airport to the hotel and then to the training site.  Also the name, phone number, and cost of a shuttle service/taxi, or statement that none are available.  Remember, the Government is only obligated to pay reasonable costs, and without proper justification, charges will be reduced or eliminated as being unreasonable.

Personal convenience or “club” membership is not a justification for higher airfares, rental cars, or the choice of airlines or hotels. 

The contractor shall always attempt to receive the Government rate for auto rentals and hotel rooms.  Authorization letters will be issued to travelers upon request.
 
G.5 CONTRACTING OFFICER’S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR)

The Contracting Officer will designate a Technical Representative (COTR) for each contract to assist in monitoring the work under the contract as well as the Task Orders issued there under.  The COTR is responsible for the technical administration of the contract and technical liaison with the Contractor.  The COTR is NOT authorized to change the statement of work, to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, delivery schedule, period of performance or other terms or conditions of the contract.

The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit or obligate the Government for the expenditure of public funds, award, modify or terminate a contract or Task Order.  The technical administration of this contract shall not be construed to authorize the revision of the terms and conditions of this contract.

If the contractor receives direction from anyone other than the Contracting Officer it believes will effect the terms, conditions, schedule or pricing, it shall not proceed with such direction.  The contractor shall discuss its reservations with the COTR, and if the issues cannot be resolved, then it shall notify the contracting officer who will resolve the matter. 

G.6 TECHNICAL DIRECTION

Performance of the work under this Task Order is subject to the Technical Direction of the COTR.  The term “Technical Direction” is defined to include, without limitation, the following:

a.	 Directions to the contractor which redirects the effort, shifts work emphasis between work areas, requires pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, fills in details or otherwise serves to accomplish the statement of work;

b.	 Provision of information to the contractor that assists in the interpretation of drawings, specifications or technical portions of the work description; and,

c.	 Review and approval/rejection of technical reports, drawings, specifications, and technical information to be delivered by the contractor.

All Technical Direction must be within the general scope of work stated in the Task Order.  The COTR does not have the authority to, and may not issue any Technical Direction that: (i) constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the general scope of the base contract; (ii) constitutes a change as defined in the base contract clause entitled “Changes”; (iii) in any manner causes an increase or decrease in the prices set forth in Section B; or (iv) changes any of the expressed terms, conditions or specifications of the Task Order.

All Technical Direction must be issued in writing, or shall be confirmed in writing by the COTR within 3 working days after issuance.

The contractor shall proceed promptly with the performance of duly issued Technical Directions.

However, if in the opinion of the contractor, the direction issued by the COTR is within one of the proscribed categories in (i) through (iv) above, the contractor shall not proceed, but shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing, within 3 working days after receipt of any such direction.  The Contracting Officer will determine if the Technical Direction is proper, or if a contract modification would be required to properly implement the direction.

Failure of the parties to agree upon the nature of the direction or upon the contract action to be taken with respect thereto shall be subject to the base contract clause entitled “Disputes.”

G.7 KEY PERSONNEL

As part of its contract proposal and each Task Order proposal, the contractor shall designate a Project Manager and other personnel deemed by the contractor to be essential to the successful completion of the contract/Task Order.  These individuals will be listed in the contract/task order as Key Personnel.  In the event any of the Key Personnel are unable to perform as proposed for any reason during the performance of the contract/Task Order, the contractor shall immediately notify the COTR and Contacting Officer in writing.  Such notice will include an explanation of the problem, a proposed replacement by someone of equal or better qualifications and experience, and shall explain the impact on performance.  All replacements are subject to the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.  However, the Government reserves the right to approve such replacements retroactively when circumstances prevent advance approval.

G.8 MONTHLY PROGRESS REPORT 
  
The Contractor shall furnish an electronic copy (in Microsoft Office 2003 or equivalent) of a monthly letter-type progress report to the Contracting Specialist and the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, with each monthly invoice, but no later than the 10th of the month following the calendar month being reported.

The report will also contain a discussion of problems encountered or anticipated that might affect performance during the following year, and recommend solutions to such problems. 

The annual report will be used by the COTR as part of the annual performance review. The Contractor shall revise staffing, work assignments, and financial controls, as needed, based on annual performance reviews.

Any notification required on the part of the Contractor shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. In the event that the contract is not funded beyond the estimated cost set forth in the schedule, the Contractor shall deliver to the Contracting Officer the data collected and the material produced or in process or acquired in connection with the performance of the project provided herein together with a summary report electronically of its progress and accomplishments to date.

Since it is necessary for you to go to the GSA per diem web page to ascertain the correct hotel and M&I expense rates, it would be very helpful to our review and approval process to include a copy of the web page, with the applicable per diem line highlighted.  Payments may be delayed when we cannot determine from the invoice which rate applies, and thus cannot approve the invoice without going back to the contractor for more information

*****ALERT**** FRAUDULENT CCR LETTERS***********

Recently, U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) contractors and potential contractors have received fraudulent letters purporting to be issued by DOT.  Often the letters have been signed by “John Duncan, Senior Procurement Officer”.  These fraudulent letters request that current or potential contractors resubmit their Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) banking information to DOT.  If you receive such a letter, please DO NOT complete the requested CCR worksheet that is attached to the letters and DO NOT release any information to the facsimile number cited in the letter.  Please be aware that no Federal agency requires any confidential information to be submitted to verify CCR registration.  The CCR is a legitimate government system.  However, to register, contractors should go directly through the CCR website and never through a third party.  There is no requirement to send information directly to any Federal agency.  For information on how to register in the CCR, please visit website http://www.ccr.gov/.

The point of contact concerning these fraudulent letters is the DOT Office of the Inspector General.  You should call their hotline at 1-800-424-9071.

SECTION L  - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS

L.1 NOTE:  Please be aware that the security procedures in the Headquarters Buildings prohibit individuals from delivering material directly to offices.  Individuals visiting the Headquarters Buildings must report to the guard station at the east entrance [farthest from the Metro station].  All materials left there will be examined and x-rayed before being delivered to room E66-206 through the normal internal mail delivery procedures.  As this could take several days, offerors must make allowances to assure that offers arrive in Room E66-206 on time.

If so requested, the guard will call the Acquisition Office (x64232) to have someone come down and accept the material once it has been examined.  Offers must be received and date/time stamped in Room E66-206 by the prescribed date and time to be considered timely, not just delivered to the guard station, the mailroom or loading dock.  While we will do our best to accommodate such requests, FHWA is not responsible if someone is not immediately available to pick up your proposal when called, or there are delays in clearing the materials.

Further, please be advised that all of our mail (items handled by the US Postal Service) is sent to another location for scanning and irradiation prior to delivery to this building.  This process can take several days, so even if you mail us something from across the street, it may be a week before it actually arrives in our office.  FedEx, United Parcel Service, etc. do have direct access to the building and offices.  Please keep these factors in mind as you determine the best means to deliver your proposal so as to ensure delivery in Room E66-206 by no later than 4:00 PM on July 6, 2009.

 To assist in expediting delivery and ensure proper handling, the outermost envelope or package [this includes FedEx boxes] containing your proposal should be prominently marked as follows:

Proposal in response to RFP DTFH61-09-R-00015
To Be Opened By Authorized Government Acquisition Personnel Only

L.2 Notice to Offerors

The offerors response must demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for high quality performance in a concise, logical, manner and should not contain superfluous material that is not directly related to this procurement.  The technical proposals shall not exceed 25 pages and shall include a brief well written Executive  Summary covering the technical and cost parts of the proposal.  Any material in excess of 25 pages will not be read or evaluated. 

The pricing proposal, staff resumes, subcontractor information, covers, table of contents, letters of commitment, the Executive Summary and the past performance material is in addition to the page limits for technical presentations. 

Company, University, or Transportation Center descriptive brochures may be included and are not part of the 25-page limitation.  You may wish to refer us to a company/organization website for additional information rather than take up pages unnecessarily.

Present your proposal in a logical manner readily tied to the requirements herein.  Each topic area is to be treated separately as they will be evaluated individually.  Identify and explain any exceptions you are taking to the proposed contract requirements. 

The offeror shall identify those who they intend to utilize in key positions in performance of any Task Orders issued.  These include staff, consultants, or subcontractors.  Resumes of all proposed key personnel are required, and may not exceed 3 pages for each person proposed.  You must indicate educational background, recent relevant experience, specific or technical accomplishments, and a listing of relevant publications.  State his or her proposed duties, and the areas for which he or she will be responsible.  The work to be performed requires seasoned professional expertise, and sophisticated data and information gathering and analysis capability. 

For all personnel who are not currently members of the offeror’s staff, an original letter of commitment and agreement to serve as planned is required to be submitted with your proposal.  The letter must cite this solicitation number.  These same requirements apply when proposing key personnel for a Task Order, with the letter citing the proposed Task Order number.  A resume alone does not meet this requirement.

Describe your organization’s technical capabilities to perform the kinds of work described under each topic area for which you wish to be awarded a contract.  Offerors must specifically address their capabilities in engineering, and technical curriculum development and presentation.  Clarity and completeness are of the utmost importance in the proposal.  With the exceptions of the responsibility determination, and the past performance evaluations, only material contained within the proposal will be considered in the source evaluation and selection process.  Therefore, be sure to include everything you want to be evaluated.  Even if we know you and/or members of your staff, we will only consider what is contained within the proposal.

Offerors are allowed 6 additional pages for the Executive Summary covering the organization, capabilities, experience and management structure.  Address your management of the contract and each Task Order.  Explain your methods for performing and managing multiple Task Orders.  Address how you would staff multiple Tasks, multiple courses at the same time, writing and teaching at the same time, and how you would replace key personnel if necessary, so as not to delay or degrade performance even when faced with a last minute loss of an individual.  Outline your methodology for selecting and managing subcontractors and consultants if you plan to utilize them.  Provide the minimum lead-time you would require to commence work after receipt of a Task Order.

This Request for Proposals is written in the Uniform Contract Format described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 15.204-1.  Offerors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Uniform Contract Format.  This will facilitate your understanding of the terms and conditions of this solicitation, these instructions and the source selection process.  It is very important that you address each evaluation factor and subfactor shown in Section M below.

L.13  Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer Central Contractor Registration

Any contracts resulting from this solicitation will contain FAR clause 52.232-33, “Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration.”  All contractors receiving payments under FHWA contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, or other contractual vehicles must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  The CCR is a Department of Defense web-based repository of contractor information.  The Electronic Funds Transfer information in the CCR must be accurate in order for contractors’ invoices or contract financing requests to be considered proper invoices for the purpose of prompt payment under DOT contracts.

Interested offerors should read and understand the requirements of FAR 52.223-33.  The successful offerors must register in the CCR before an award can be made, and must maintain current, updated information in the CCR throughout the performance period of the contract.  Offerors can register in CCR at anytime, and are encouraged to do so immediately.

Offerors may register in the CCR database and obtain additional information at http://www.ccr.gov, or by calling 1.888.227.2423.  The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the DOT’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor must confirm on an annual basis that its information in the database is accurate and complete.

L.14 Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal

The original proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization and must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP.

L.15 Past Performance Evaluation

By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship, forecasting and controlling costs; and adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance.  The offeror’s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and their commitment to customer satisfaction will be assessed, along with their business like concern for the interest of their customer.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror.
The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror’s past performance based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror consistently has demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of quality services at fair and reasonable prices.  Specific experience developing and presenting the courses covered by this contract may enhance the scoring in this area.

Offerors with previous experience in the topics they are proposing on must list and summarize their performance on similar or related contracts completed within the last three years, as well as those currently in process.

Provide your last three relevant contracts in terms of size and scope (but not more than three years old) with FHWA as well as other organizations both commercial and governmental.  You may submit more than three if necessary to properly cover specialized areas of performance or because of the broad scope of the work.  Sending in more than three that are all for the same type of work is unnecessary and discouraged.  The offeror should also submit past performance information on proposed major subcontractors.  Provide the following supplemental information (not to exceed two pages per reference):

o	The name and address of the organization for which the services were performed; the name and current telephone number of the responsible technical representative of the organization; the contract number; the type of contract; and a brief description of the services provided, including the length of performance and the total dollar amount.

o	In addition, explain how the reference applies to this solicitation’s Statement of Work.  FHWA may use this information to contact representatives to obtain information regarding your performance.

o	Briefly explain how well you met the contract quality and schedule requirements.

o	List any contract under which you received either a cure notice or show cause letter, or that was terminated for any reason within the past 3 years.  Briefly explain the circumstances in each such instance.

Offerors are responsible to have at least three completed Past Performance Questionnaires submitted with the original proposal (see Section J).  Questionnaires shall be in separate envelopes, sealed by the reference for confidentiality.  [Only one copy need be submitted with the original proposal]

 The Government may use random sampling from the references provided, and may also use any other past performance information obtained by the Government.

The contracting officer will also consider such performance information along with other factors in determining whether the offeror is considered responsible, as defined in FAR 9.101.

L.16 Until a formal notice of award is issued, signed by a contracting officer, no communication by the Government either written or oral shall be binding or in any way interpreted as a promise that an award will be made.

Qualified HUBZone firms are identified in the Small Business Administration’s website at: http://www.sba.gov/hubzone.

M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD

In addition to the criteria listed above, price will be considered in the award decision.  Price proposals will be analyzed to assess realism and probable cost to the Government.  The proposals will be analyzed to assess their reasonableness.  This means that the prices in an offeror’s proposal are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror’s technical proposal. 

The Government intends to make multiple ID/IQ awards with an expectation for approximately two awards to be made, with minimum amounts of $95,000. The total maximum value of this procurement is $6,606,504.

The Government will accept the offers that are considered the best value to the Government.  A best value analysis will be performed taking into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, cost and past performance analysis, and the perceived ability to perform timely, high quality, consistently reliable support services as provided herein.

In the determination of Best Value, the relative weight given to all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, is more important than price.  However, offerors should note that as technical scores approach being essentially equivalent, cost would become more important in the selection decision.

M.4 52.216.27 Single or Multiple Awards  OCT 1995

The Government may elect to award a single ID/IQ contract or to award multiple ID/IQ contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.

REQUIREMENT

C.1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  The Government has a requirement that the National Directory of Native Plant Materials be updated on an annual basis.  The directory database itself is maintained and available on-line via a collaborative agreement with State and Private Forestry.  The contractor shall be responsible for completing an annual update to the national directory of native plant materials, including contacting all nurseries/seed producers on the current list, and conducting an Internet search to ensure any new nurseries and seed producers are added to the list.  
 
C.2 SPECIFIC TASKS:  

C.2.1  The contractor shall access the current annual database information available at http://www.rngr.net/Applications/directory/#.  Modification to the website display itself is not possible, so the contractor will need to export the database into a modifiable document format.  Prior to contract commencement, the Government will provide an administrative access code that will allow the contractor to export the database into a Word document and also make the required updates/additions to the database itself.

C.2.2  The contractor shall contact each nursery in the database and add/update any information that is not current.  If a vendor is no longer in business that information shall be noted on the hard copy database and updated in the electronic database as well.  All out-of-business nursery information shall be retained in the database. 

C.2.3  The contractor shall perform an Internet industry search to capture any new nurseries/seed producers who are new to the industry since the last annual update.  The definition of a new nursery/seed producer for the purposes of this database is that the vendor must “produce” the plants/seeds.  At least 5% of the total production has to be plant/seed species that are native to the United States and/or Canada.  Any new vendors shall be added to both the hard copy and electronic database.

C.3  CONTRACT DELIVERABLES:  Upon completion of each annual update the contractor shall be required to present the Government with an electronic Word document that has been updated to reflect and incorporate any new vendors to the industry as well as any updated vendor information for vendors already in the database.  This electronic document shall mirror the updated online database located at: http://www.rngr.net/Applications/directory/#.  The deliverable is due to the Government POC (identified at time of award) no later than 90 days after commencement of work.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 518210 – Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services. The Size Standard is $25,000,000.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-32

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Active Compensation System for Electromagnetic Stray Fields for a Zeiss NVision 40 Cross Beam Focused Ion Beam / Scanning Electron Microscope System.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Solicitation No. W912EE-09-T-4523 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 532411, SIC Code is 4499, with a Size Standard of $7.0m. This procurement may be quoted as follows: Line Item 0001: Lease of (1) Tenderboat with Operating Personnel; Estimated Quantity: 100; Unit of Measure: Days; Unit Price: $____________; Total Line Item Price  Line Item 0001: $___________________. Line Item 0002: Option to Extend Lease of (1) Tenderboat with Operating Personnel; Estimated Quantity: 30; Unit of Measure: Days; Unit Price: $____________; Total Line Item Price  Line Item 0002: $___________________.<BR><BR>1. Object of These Specifications.  It is the object of these specifications to secure for the Government by leasing one tender boat with operating personnel. The boat will be used on the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois,(Mile 953.8 AHP) to the Head of Passes (Mile 0.0), the Old River, the Atchafalaya River, the Red River (Louisiana), the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) as far west as the Calcasieu River and the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO). The tender will transport Government barges at job sites as may be directed by the Contracting Officer or his representative. All mileage will be the mileage shown in the latest editions of the Flood Control and Navigation Maps of the above mentioned waterways.  These are prepared under the direction of the President, Mississippi River Commission, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, P.O. Box 80, Vicksburg, MS 39181 0080. 2.  Inspection of Equipment.  Prior to award, the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative will make an inspection of the equipment offered to determine the condition and suitability for the service for which it will be used.  If found that the equipment offered is not suitable for the purpose intended, or that it is not in good mechanical condition, it will not be accepted and the bidder on that equipment may be rejected as non-responsive.  If deficiencies are of a minor nature and may be easily repaired, the bidder will be given seven days to correct all deficiencies found. Examples of minor deficiencies are found on the MVK Form 385-18-R, Safety Inspection Checklist for Towboats and Tenders.  If the deficiencies are not corrected within the seven day period, the bidder will be rejected as non-responsive.  However, in case of award, this inspection will not relieve the Contractor from the satisfactory operation of the equipment during the period of the contract or any extension thereof.  Additionally, the contractor shall submit the completed Data Sheet (attachment A) with bid. 3.  Delivery and Release. Delivery of this boat shall be made afloat to the Engineer in Charge, Mat Sinking Unit, Vicksburg Harbor, Vicksburg, MS, or as directed by the Engineer in Charge, within five (5) calendar days after receipt of notice to report to work.  It is expected, but not guaranteed, that delivery of the boat will be required on or about 27 July 2009.  When delivered, the boat shall be ready for operation and in good operating condition.  The boat will be released to the Contractor at the location of the job on which it is last used. 4.  Payments. a. Payments will be made semi monthly after receipt of a proper invoice.  Invoices shall be submitted in triplicate, prepared on typewriter or with pen and ink.  Terms of payment must be stated, including cash discount, if any.  Invoices shall be sent to Mat Sinking Unit, P.O. Box 7, Delta, LA, 71233-0007, ATTN: Joel Brown.  Payment will be made by the Disbursing Officer, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Finance Center, 7800 3rd Avenue, Millington, TN 38054-5005. b.  Except as provided in subparagraph d. below, payment will be made for the number of hours of actual use during the time that the boat is retained in the custody of a representative of the Contracting Officer. Time will begin on the day that the boat is delivered to the Government Representative as stated in paragraph 3 above, and end on the day that the boat is finally released to the Contractor.  Actual use does not include non-work c. Payment will be made at the applicable hourly rate stipulated in the contract, calculated to the nearest hour. d. No payment will be made for lost time due to breakdowns, or for any causes due to the fault or negligence of the Contractor or his employees. e. Lost Time.  Lost time will be considered as the time when the boat is inoperative because of breakdowns and/or other causes due to the fault or negligence of the Contractor or his employees.  If due to job requirements, the boat is allowed to work with one engine inoperative, the unit price will be reduced to seventy percent (70%) of the applicable contract amount.  Time lost for minor repairs and/or adjustments to the boat which, in the opinion of the contracting officer, does not interfere with or result in loss of operating time, will not be charged as lost time to the Contractor. 5.  Contract Period.  a. It is estimated that the tender will be used approximately 100 days per year.  The contract may be extended up to an additional 30 calendar days at the option of the Government.  It is expected that the tender will generally be used 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  However, these days are not guaranteed and the Government reserves the right to use the tender for more or less days as needed.  The right is also reserved by the Government to suspend use of the tender for any period when the Government revetment operations are suspended. 6.  Performance of Plant. a. Award of the Contract and acceptance of the boat shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility for the satisfactory performance of the boat.   Notwithstanding the estimated days and hours of operation contained in Paragraph 5 above, time is of the essence in the delivery of services under the Contract.  Strict compliance with the delivery schedule is essential and untimely delivery of the services required under the Contract, or other unsatisfactory performance, will jeopardize the interests of the Government.  The delivery schedule and the services performed by the boat are crucial to the Government operations, which it will be assisting. Failure to meet the delivery schedule for this Item will be cause for immediate termination of the Contract as described in paragraph (a) (1) of the DEFAULT clause of the Contract. In addition, if at any time during the contract period it is determined by the Contracting Officer that the boat is not capable of doing satisfactory work and/or meeting the delivery schedule, the contract may be terminated.  The Contracting Officer will exercise his discretion as to the best interest of the Government. However, the Contractor is put on notice that the contract for the boat may be terminated if the boat is inoperable or not capable of safely operating for a total of 24 hours in any seven-day period, or if the tender is inoperable on one engine for a total of 48 hours in any seven day period. Payment will be made as provided in paragraph 4 above only for the time accrued prior to the date of termination. c.  If the Contracting Officer allows the tender to work with only one engine, as described in paragraph 4.e. above, this in no way relieves the Contractor from the time constraints described above. All time allowed to work on one engine will be considered in computing the time periods described above as conditions for termination. d. The conditions listed above are not a complete listing of causes for termination and the Government reserves the right to terminate the Contract for any other conditions of default as determined by the Contracting Officer and in accordance with the termination clauses of the Contract. <BR>7. Control and Responsibility. a. The Contracting Officer or his representative shall direct the location or site of work and the hours of work.  However, the rental is to be considered as a time charter, as distinguished from a demise or a bare boat charter, and the operation of the vessel shall at all times be under the direction of the Contractor or his employees. b. Except to respond to an immediate emergency, the Contractor shall not cease to perform an assigned mission or cease to comply with his operating orders that are in effect. Neither shall the boat leave the immediate area of assigned responsibility without obtaining permission from the Contracting Officer's Representative in charge of the operations being performed. 8. Supervision. Proper supervision will be maintained on the boat by the Contractor to insure compliance with the terms of the contract and the orders of the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor's authorized representatives will be designated in writing at the time of delivery of the boat and at any time thereafter when such authorized representatives may be changed.  No instructions of the Contracting Officer's Representative or lack thereof will at any time relieve the Contractor from the responsibility of complying fully with all requirements of the contract.  In case of differences arising between the Contracting Officer's Representative and the Contractor or his agent, appeal may be made to the Contracting Officer, whose decision shall be final.  The Contracting Officer's Representative is not authorized to waive nor alter in any respect any of the terms or requirements of the contract, or to make additional requirements. 9. EM 385 1 1, SAFETY AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS. Contractors are required to comply with the latest version, and all posted changes, of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manuel in effect on the issue date of this solicitation.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The Uniformed
Services University
of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda,
 Maryland, intends to negotiate a
contract, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b),
with Kyoto Kagaku to supply a Ultrasound Hemorrphagic Phantom. The Ultrasound
Hemorrhagic Phantom<span>&nbsp; </span>is being procured as
a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition
of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures). The
sole source determination is based on Kyoto Kagaku&rsquo;s Ultrasound Hemorrhagic
Phantom being the only trauma simulator to enable trainees to learn ultrasound
skills of solid organs with embedded pathology and fluid collections in a
realistic simulated torso. The aforementioned characteristic exhibited by the Ultrasound
Hemorrhagic Phantom is necessary for learning the proper techniques for
detecting the presence of intraperitoneal or pericardial fluid in traumatic
patients, which is becoming increasingly vital in deployed medical settings.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES    (JUN 2006)
(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W9124809R0008.<br><br>8.1  Remove:  Contract Clause entitled INPSECTION OF CONSTRUCTION <BR>ADD:  IAW 52.212-4 (a) Inspection/Acceptance.<BR><BR>  <BR>Add Questions and Answers:<BR><BR>1.  Width of road to be applied to?  <BR>ANSWER:  Approximately 24 feet.  All road surfaces are gravel.<BR><BR>2.  What is cutoff time between request?  PWS says everyday but is that 24 hours or 12 hours?<BR>ANSWER:  DO will be approximately 3 months apart.<BR><BR>3.  In 3.2.1.1.1 What does performance Period mean?  Is it the time to apply the solution to the ground or the time the solution is to be effective when applied?<BR>Answer:  Preformance Period (3.2.1.1.1) is the time the contractor has to apply the solution to the ground (Period of Performance - POP)<BR><BR>4.  2.1.1 and 2.1.2 did not make it on the solicitation <BR>See amendment 1.<BR><BR>5.  Contract Manpower reporting, how does it apply to the contract?<BR>ANSWER:  Yes, see Manpower reporting narrative below.<BR><BR>6.  Past performance?  <BR>ANSWER: Contractors can submit references back 5 years for like or similar work.<BR><BR>7.  When do they start?  <BR>ANSWER:  NET 5 days NLT 15 days ARO<BR><BR>8.  Will offers be considered for terms less than 4 option periods? <BR>ANSWER:  No.<BR><BR>9.  On the offer schedule- I am unsure of the Contractor Manpower Reporting CLIN.  Can you please explain?  <BR>ANSWER:  See Manpower Reporting narrative below.<BR><BR>10.  My assumption is that you want an estimate of labor dollars to perform the applications however the preceding CLIN asks for Purchase & Application.<BR>ANSWER:  See Manpower Reporting narrative below.<BR><BR>11.  We are the manufacturer of the line of environmentally safe dust control products which is non-toxic and free of carcinogens. Why are no specifications required for toxicity in this solicitation? Would a product used on the roads at Ft. Campbell need approval from the Environment office? <BR>ANSWER:  See 3.1  of the Statement of Work.<BR> <BR>12.   Could we have a guided site visit? When would be a good time/date for this? <BR>ANSWER:  A site visit has already been performed.  If contractor requests, a  site map of the prescribed areas will be provided and contractor may visit the site on their own.<BR><BR>13.   To provide a thorough quote we would prefer to have the dimensions of the sites to be treated. The solicitation gives only a total number of gallons (571,000 gal); since our product has different application rates than other products we cannot relate to this number without knowing the size of the site(s). This can be expressed in acres, square feet, mile of road (_ feet wide)& <BR>ANSWER:  This will be a requirements contract.  Delievery orders will be issued on an as needed basis.  The quantities are listed with a total.  Government cannot provide a detailed estimate for the  areas to be applied until a DO is written.  The government may use all of the quantity on teh bis schedule(571,000 gallons) or we may use partial, depending on need.  We are purchasing up to 571,000 gallons of solution applied at the rate and density of the spec sheet. <BR><BR>14.  Application rates/methods and traffic patterns can affect the overall efficacy of any treatment regardless of the product used. What is the proposed application rate/method, and what is the expectation of performance (i.e. 30-days, 6-months, etc&)? How often does the customer expect the site to be re-treated? <BR>ANSWER:  The government understands that the requirement will vary as to traffic and treatment requirements for long term efficacy.  The government will order retreats as required.  <BR><BR>15.   Under 3.2.1.1.1 there is a conversion chart. What is the reasoning behind this conversion chart? Can you please explain the gallon amounts and performance times to me in greater depth? <BR>ANSWER:  Quantity			Range				Performance Period<BR><BR>31,500 gallons minimum	31,500 to 199,999 gallons	49 days (7 weeks)<BR>571,000 gallons maximum	200,000 to 399,999 gallons	70 days (10 Weeks)<BR>			      400,000 to 571,000 gallons     91 days (13 weeks)<BR><BR>This is setting Performance Period for the issuance of the delievery orders.  This means that if we order 31,500 gallons to 199,999 gallons of product, the contractor has 49 days to apply the product, etc.<BR><BR>16.   There are a variety of methods for determining the success/failure of a dust control product. What is the metric for success at Fort Campbell? <BR>See the QUSP narrative below.<BR><BR>17.   All colors, odors, and specific specifications such as the specific gravity details are different with every product. Why is the specific gravity such a large concern? Does this have to match exactly? If so, why? <BR>ANSWER:  We want a polymer asphalt blend with attached minimum specifications.  The contractor has to apply a product meeting those requirements.<BR><BR>18.   What is the size of the staging area to be provided? Is the railway the preferred method of shipping, or is Ft Campbell able to accommodate trucks as well? <BR>ANSWER:  An area approximately 1 acre is provide to the contractor during application.  It is located on Patton Road just south of Lafayette, KY.<BR><BR>19. One of the largest benefits to the TerraLOC solution is that it is water soluble. It states this product can not be re-wet. Could you please give me your reasoning behind this? <BR>ANSWER:  Fort Campbell desires a product that solidifies.   TerraLoc product does not meet the requirement per this comment.<BR><BR>20.  Would the government consider adding a Price Escalation Clause:<BR>The pricing in this Sales and Service Agreement/Proposal is offered with an economic price adjustment clause.  This clause provides for upward or downward changes to the selling/quoted price based on the movement in the actual raw material costs of Road Pro NT.  This clause is also tied to the published selling price for primary paving grade asphalt, which is identified as the benchmark, and is published in the Asphalt Weekly Monitor, copyright Poten & Partners, Inc.

(Yearly in the case of Fort Campbell)  Midwest will also provide a minimum of two weeks advance notice of any changes in the pricing in writing and cite the raw material or benchmark change effecting the increase or decrease.  <BR>ANSWER:  The government will not consider adding this clause to the contract.<BR><BR>Add Anti Terrorism Clause:<BR><BR>5152.209-4000	DOD LEVEL I ANTITERRORISM (AT) STANDARDS (FEB 2009)<BR><BR>(a)  Pursuant to Department of Defense Instruction Number 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, dated October 2, 2006, each contractor employee requiring access to a Federally-controlled installation, facility and/or Federally-controlled information system(s) shall complete Level I AT Awareness Training on an annual basis and receive a certificate of completion.

<DESC>Subject: Laboratory Case Model Validation

Solicitation Number:  FDA1056086

Response Date: 19 June 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following laboratory case model validation. 

Summary: 
Validation of the Magneto Hydro Dynamic (MHD) simulation platform for the study of MHD induced signals during MRI scans (already developed) and investigation of the MHD effect by simulations and measurements. This work is mainly based on the Virtual Family male model (with revised aorta and vena cava model) and the corresponding MRI measurements. 

Background: 
The overall research objective is to investigate and characterize an electromagnetic biomarker for heart failure (HF) and recovery. The goal is to develop a method to non-invasively characterize cardiac dynamics, including stroke volume and cardiac output. The research will assess information about blood flow that can supplement present non-invasive ultrasound techniques for the evaluation of heart failure. The new physiological biomarker that will be evaluated is the MHD signal recorded on the electrocardiograom (ECG) while the subject is in the strong static magnetic field of a magnetic resonance imager (MRI). This MHD signal is caused by blood flow in the magnetic field. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the MHD signal is capable of the rapid and non-invasive flow measurements that are necessary for evaluating HF, particularly diastolic HF. Such signals have been collected in both animals and humans by other investigators. Analysis of the MHD signal recorded with the 12-lead ECG in conjunction with physiological measurements will require electromagnetic modeling to determine the sources of the signals (i.e., ventricle, aorta, coronary arteries, and carotid arteries) and the size of the magnetic field needed to obtain useful physiological signals. The final goal is to determine locations and blood-flow vectors (magnitude and direction) that may be used as functional biomarkers for cardiac function in healthy and HF subjects. 

Previous work: 
In the first phase of the this project a MHD solver was developed that reads in a given flow distribution and, based on a novel quasistatic approximation, calculates the resulting electric field distribution due to the application of an external magnetic field and its interaction with the charged particles in the blood flow. The solver has been fully integrated into SEMCAD X and works with the detailed anatomical full-body models available for SEMCAD X. The SEMCAD X modeling, import and export feature have been extended (including scripting interface). Novel postprocessing functionality has been added. 

Statement of Work: 
The purpose of this purchase order is the validation of the previously developed MHD solver and its application to a model case (based on Virtual Family male).  For this the following tasks need to be performed: 
1) Development and delivery of aorta and vena cava models suitable for computational flow simulations based on the Virtual Family male data. The aorta model should include the descending and abdominal aorta with branches into iliac arteries (abdominal bifurcation). The vena cava model should include the anterior and posterior part of the vena cava model. All models should be delivered as CAD models in *.sat format. 
2) Transient (pulsatile) simulations of realistic temporal blood flow distribution (unlike the steady state flow solution used under contract HHSF22320081116P) with 0.01 second temporal resolution in the vessel structures developed in Task 1 using flow solvers. 
3) Comparison of the spatial and temporal simulated blood flow distribution with MRI velocity measurements which are compatible with the original Virtual Family male model. The simulated data should be within 20% of the MRI velocity measurements. 
The FDA will use the MHD solver developed under contract HHSF22320081116P to select optimized surface locations, on the Virtual Family male model, for MHD measurements. These locations will be provided to the contractor so that they may: 
4) Extract MHD time curves for the selected optimized surface locations from multiple MHD simulations, 
5) Compare ECG (free space) and ECG+MHD (in 3 Tesla MRI field) simulations to recorded measurements, under the same conditions, from an anatomy similar to the actual Virtual Family male model. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 4:30 pm (1630) EST on 11 June 2009.  

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  FOB Destination means the contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. 
 
Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance is significantly more important than price.

 The purpose of amendmet three (4) is to clarify the Followings:

1. The solicitation states that a written report on Task 1 is due no later 
than 30 days from the initial meeting with NIST, and the written report on 
Task 2 and 3 is due 90 days after contract award. However the period of 
performance for Tasks 1 to 3 is 6 months.
Is the intent that the reports delivered at 30 and 90 days are final reports 
on the respective tasks, and in this case why is the performance period 6 
months rather than 90 days? Or is the intent that the reports delivered at 30 
and 90 days are interim reports, with a final report due at 6 months?


The PWS calls for a written report on Task 1 to COTR 30 days and written report on Task 2 and 3 to COTR  90 days after contract award. These are interim reports.  The final report is due September 30, 2009.
  
2. The solicitation states that the contractor shall report progress in the 
form of monthly summary reports. Therefore are there 8 written reports due in 
the 6 month base (6 monthly reports plus the written reports on Task 1 and 
Tasks 2/3)?

   The PWS states that the contractor shall report progress in the form of monthly summary reports. 
These reports should summarize progress made by the Contractor on contract requirements during the reporting period in question	.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following Questions and Answers.

Q1: What is the schedule for completion or delivery milestones for this project?  
A1: See RFQ.

Q2: What is the schedule for award and furnishing artwork for this project? 
A1: See RFQ.
 
Q3: Is there a PDF of the art files (either draft or final) that can be viewed so as to determine ink coverage, in-line color issues, binding issues, etc?
A3:  See attachment #1, draft version of the catalog. 
 
Q4: The perforation on the last text page runs vertical? 
A4: Yes the perforation on the last text page runs vertical. 

Q5: How far from the spine is the perforation? 
A5:  The perforation is at least ¼-inch from the spine and can be moved out to accommodate.  
 
Q6: You specify “double thick” cartons for shipping.  Are the 275# test cartons we use for all Government projects acceptable?  Or do we need to furnish double wall cartons of a higher edge crush strength?  If so, can you specify the edge crush test so we can include the proper cartons in our bid? 
A6: Multiple shipping is done with the cartons therefore we do not have the specific edge crush test information.  It is imperative that the higher edge crush strength is utilized to ensure that the cartons do not get mangled or damaged during the multiple shipment cycles.

Q7:  This seems to be more of a proposal than a bid.  Should I create an offer in two volumes as I would normally in a peer review proposal?  In this case, pricing would come in one email and the technical proposal would come in another?  With the latter email being reviewed for acceptability before the pricing email is even opened?
A7: Please provide a quote as instructed in the RFQ.

Q8: When will we be notified if there are any clarifications or deficiencies in the proposal/offer?
A8: As stated in RFQ, FAR clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors – Commercial Items.

Q9: When do you need pricing back?
A9: See RFQ.

All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged.

<DESC><p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron Strategic Sourcing Flight (AETC CONS/LGCS), Randolph AFB, TX is conducting an acquisition for Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) services at 12 AETC Bases and Fort Sam Houston (FSH). This pre-solicitation synopsis is being issued for non-personal services. Note: The description contained within this synopsis is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all inclusive. AETC intends to combine refuse and recycling services incorporating a Resource Management (RM) approach and consolidate 12 AETC bases plus Ft Sam Houston (FSH) through strategic sourcing. The RM approach is a dual vectored approach aimed at analyzing waste streams currently generated by installations. One avenue seeks out methods and innovation to grossly increase diversion. A second analysis determines the most cost effective commodities to process at the specified installation based on existing Government Furnished Equipment/Property (GFE/GFP) and commodity market strengths. Both streams are baselined to determine actual diversion metrics. Diversion of solid waste is focused upon obtaining the new diversion goals while maximizing the amount of revenue generating commodities being diverted to the recycling operations. Innovative methods are recommended and implemented throughout the process to increase solid waste separation and disposal, as well as innovative use of refuse/recycling container placement and scheduling/routing to minimize non-value added tasks in the process as well as increasing the installation's participation in the program. Successful offerors will be responsible for all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform refuse and recycling services through a RM approach. The RM approach can be utilized within both the refuse and recycling functions separately. The contractor shall perform to the standards in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to include all applicable local, state and federal regulations. We anticipate a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to up to five (5) awardees will result from the solicitation. We foresee the basic MATOC to be for a one (1) year base period and will include 7 one-year option periods. Each base will receive a separate task order and shall be for a one (1) year base period and will include 4 one-year option periods. We intend to issue task orders for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler upon award of the MATOCs. We anticipate three (3) additional task order competitions over the next three years to phase in the additional 10 bases. There will be a 30-day mobilization period for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler AFB's scheduled to begin in Nov 09. A 30-day mobilization period will be utilized prior to implementing each additional task order. We anticipate posting the Request for Proposal on or about 26 Jun 09 and proposals are anticipated to be due 30 days later on or about 26 July 09.

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS: Project ZHTV060027. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The Period of Performance is 270 days.</p>
<p><br />NAICS CODE: 238210. Size Standard $14M. Install Duplicate Electrical feed to Museum of the Air Force, Area B. Install cable, duct, and padmount switches to create new feed to existing loop circuits serving Museum of the Air Force and The Prairies. Load growth at these sites will cause the existing 250 kcmil cable to be insufficient to serve both loads if one side of the loop fails. Due to the long length of cable feeding these sites, repairs could take 1-3 days, and there is too much load to be restored by portable generator. The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.</p>
<p>Special Requirement/Considerations: Work will need to be coordinated with the Exterior Electric Shop to allow them to switch electrical loads to accommodate the work with minimal customer electrical outages. Work on switches where power outages are required will need to be scheduled to minimize disruption. Work will require electrical contractor experienced with work on 12kV underground systems.</p>
<p>Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>

This amendment provides clarification to Offeror questions. See attached file DTFAWA-09-R-AE000 Admendment 1.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is soliciting competitive proposals to provide Architect and Engineer (A-E) design services for the FAA's EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Program.

These design services are detailed in the attached Screening Information Request (SIR) DTFAWA-09-R-AE000, to include all attachments. 
The FAA anticipates an award of an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five (5) year base period and at the FAA's discretion two- two year option periods.   
Offers, submitted in response to this Screening Information Request (SIR) will be evaluated in two phases with the most highly competitive proposals advancing to Phase II. This approach and all other Offerror submission requirements are in Section L.

Therefore, the successful Offeror will not be awarded any construction effort where the design was developed via this contract. 
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this solicitation.  Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the Offeror's expense.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), or for Small Businesses.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  The small business size standard for NAICS 336611 is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to perform emergency drydock repairs to the USCGC Bayberry (WLI-65400), a 65 foot inland buoy tender.  The homeport of the vessel is Caswell Beach, North Carolina.  The performance period is twenty-one (21) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about June 15, 2009.  The vessel’s availability will be geographically restricted to an area no greater than 400 nautical miles from the cutter’s homeport and no open water transits. The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC Bayberry (WLI-65400).  This work may include, but is not limited to: remove, inspect, and reinstall propellers; repair and recondition propellers; remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller shafts; fabricate propeller shaft; straighten propeller shaft; renew water lubricated shaft bearings; fabricate rudders; remove and inspect rudder stock; install rudder assemblies; fabricate rudder stock; preserve underwater body – “Partial”, routine drydocking; provide temporary logistics;  composite labor; GFP report; and laydays.  All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  In accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.1405, if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond in a letter either by e-mail to tomeka.evans@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  In your response you must include (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by June 5, 2009 at 12:00 pm, EST.   Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HubZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HubZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside, or Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone, SDVOSB set-aside, or small business set-aside, will be posted in the Fedbizopps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Questions may be referred to Ms. Tomeka Evans at (757) 628-4666.
