STATEMENT OF WORK

Endocrinology Diagnostic:  Cytopathology and ThryoSequence Testing

1.	INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW: 
Fine Needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a common approach to evaluate thyroid nodules. It offers definitive diagnosis of a benign or malignant nodule in the majority of the cases. However 10-25% of nodules yield one of three indeterminate cytological diagnoses leading to suboptimal management of these patients. Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) are a common indeterminate diagnosis with cancer risk ranging from 6% to 48%. Current guidelines recommend that most of these patients undergo diagnostic thyroid surgery to assess whether nodules are benign or malignant. Approximately 70% to 80% of the time, the nodules prove to be benign by surgical pathology.
The ThyroSeq v.2 multigene Next Generation sequencing (NGS) panel of molecular mutational markers conducted provides both high sensitivity and high specificity for cancer detection in thyroid nodules with AUS/FLUS cytology, which should allow improved management of these patients by avoiding many of the diagnostic surgeries currently performed for benign nodules, with associated decreases in health costs and postsurgical complications. Through ThyroSeq v.2 over 400 hotspots and fusion points on over 60 genes are tested to classify both benign and malignant nodules.
By doing a Next Generation Sequencing of gene to determine whether the nodule is benign or malignant ThyroSeq v.2 we comply with VA's mission of providing exceptional care that improves the health and overall well-being of the Veteran.

1.1	Background:
The ThyoSeq v.2 FNA Analysis is a diagnostic service provided for the assessment of thyroid nodules. The ThyroSeq v.2 Next Generation sequencing combines specialized cytopathology experts from incumbent vendor who properly identifies and categorizes biopsies allowing for further testing on only truly indeterminate FNAs. Physicians submit to incumbent vendor thyroid nodule FNA samples collected in a single patient visit. The combination of cytopathology screening with reflex to molecular testing is what makes ThyroSeq V.2 the most accurate diagnosis allowing patients to avoid unneeded surgeries and receive the right surgery. 

1.2	Scope of Work
Patient samples obtained through fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies are collected for both cytopathology assessment and ThyroSeq v.2. Initially cytopathology assessment is conducted. If the cytopathology diagnosis is benign, suspicious for malignancy, malignant or non-diagnostic, the Cytopathology FNA Analysis is complete. If the cytopathology diagnosis is indeterminate (includes Follicular lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS)/Atypia of Undetermined significance (AUS) and (suspicious for) Hurthle/Follicular Neoplasm), the thyroid nodule is greater than or equal to 1 cm and the patient is 21 or older, The ThyroSeq v.2 Next generation gene sequencing is performed. Thyroseq v.2 measures gene mutation which classifies both benign and malignant nodules by identifying actual mutations. Over 400 hotspot genes and fusion points on over 60 genes are tested. All results will be reported by the incumbent vendor.

<p>All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to advertise that Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land &amp; Maritime is soliciting for a successor initiative of Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) Program that will provide integrated supply chain management and logistics support of line-side delivery of bench stock items to customers involved in maintenance, repair, and overhaul operations at the maintenance depots for the maintenance/production lines at Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) located in Anniston, Alabama. The bench stock parts will normally be stored at or near the point of use (line-side support) in performance of the maintenance, repair, and/or overhaul of military weapons systems or related equipment. The IPV contract is a performance-based agreement structured around the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Performance-based contracting emphasizes that all aspects of an acquisition are based upon the purpose of the work to be performed as opposed to the manner in which the work is executed. The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the Government. The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed (5) years.
<p>This acquisition includes a complete Schedule of Supplies for IPV at ANAD which is currently 14,691 items, from which 2,257 items will be priced commercially to support ANAD. That population of 2257 NSNs is considered the All or None population and therefore will be required to be priced in order to be considered a responsible offeror. This solicitation will be unrestricted with Full and Open competition. The solicitation will be available on or about November 20, 2015 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/.</p>
<p>The item under this acquisition may be subject to Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the Unites States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. Dollars. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. The North American Industry Classification System for this procurement is 332722 and number of employees is 500.</p>
<p>Solicitation will be unrestricted with full &amp; open competition. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.</p>
<p>The Government will base the determination of best value on a comparative assessment of the offerors' prices and non-price factors listed within the solicitation. The combined weight of the non-price factors is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>The solicitation document contains information that has been designated as "Militarily Critical Technical Data." Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.

The DLIS Unites States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal/.<br />Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Product Lists, Military Handbooks, and other standardization documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP), in Philadelphia, PA. Most documents are available in Adobe PDF format from the ASSIST database via the Internet at http://assist.daps.dla.mil/.</p>

Patterns, Drawings, Deviations Lists, Purchase Descriptions, etc., are not stocked at the DODSSP.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualification requirement at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.

<DESC>VA MAINE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TRANSPORTATION SERVICES 

I. GENERAL OVERVIEW:
The VA Maine Healthcare System requires a contractor to furnish Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Critical Care Transport (CCT) Ambulance Services to its beneficiaries.  The contractor must provide all equipment, personnel, supervision, and support to provide these transportation services.  All services will be provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract, and industry accepted quality standards highlighted in this SOW.

The Maine Healthcare system includes the Togus VA Medical Center located in Augusta, ME and ten community based outpatient clinics (Bangor, Calais, Caribou, Fort Kent, Houlton, Lewiston/Auburn, Lincoln, Portland, Rumford, and Saco).  Services include transportation to and from the main hospital and CBOC's, as well as occasional Ambulance runs out of state to VA Medical Centers in Massachusetts (see attachment B for historical trip data).

Historically, the VA Maine Healthcare System has divided the state into geographic zones and then awarded each zone individually.  That will no longer be the case, as the government seeks one primary contractor (or transportation broker) that will now handle the entire state and the logistics of establishing subcontracting networks (if necessary).

The intent is to establish an "all inclusive" price to the greatest extent possible by establishing a fixed price per trip for routine transports.    Base trips are defined as being within a 25 mile radius of the pick-up point.  Therefore, pricing is established on a per trip basis with additional line items to cover mileage over the 25 mile radius, or special scenarios.  Please see attached price schedule for further clarification.

II. TASKING/SPECIFICATIONS:
1.	GENERAL: Contractor will furnish twenty-four (24) hour BLS/ALS/CCT Ambulance Service for the beneficiaries of the VA Maine Healthcare System.  Service to be for the entire State of Maine, seven (7) days a week, nights, and holidays.  Service to include transport to and from VA Maine as well as our Community Based Outpatient Clinics and Vet Centers in Caribou, Calais, Bangor, Rumford, Lewiston, Saco as well as ambulance transport to VA Medical Centers in Massachusetts.

2.	NUMBER OF PATIENTS: It is understood and agreed that only ONE patient will be transported on a trip unless specifically authorized by the VA.  An authorized official of VA Maine may, in the interest of the patient, allow a relative to accompany him/her at no extra charge to the Government.  The contractor must ensure that the pick-ups and drop-offs are scheduled so that the total distance traveled will result in the most economical charge to the Government.

3.	WAITING TIME:  For time lost in waiting at either end or both ends of a trip due to causes beyond their control, the Contractor will be reimbursed at the rate of one-fourth the hourly rate quoted in their bid for each quarter hour or fraction thereof in excess of one-quarter hour from the time Contractor reports to the designated person.  If the pickup is other than at the VA Maine, the Contractor will call the Transportation Coordinator or Medical Administration Assistant on duty as soon as they anticipate that a delay may develop for which they expect to claim reimbursement.  This call is only for the purpose of verifying arrival time at the pickup point and is not necessary if the Contractor anticipates no delay for which they will claim reimbursement.

4.	COMPLETED TRIP:  When ambulance service under the terms of this contract involves pick-up of a patient who is to be brought to this medical center or to another hospital and/or clinic for hospitalization or treatment, the trip will be considered complete when the patient is delivered by ambulance personnel to the admitting/evaluation unit, a specified ward or unit, or to the location specified at the time the trip is requested.

5.	NON-PICKUP OF PATIENT (DRY RUN):  When ambulance service involves a trip to or from this medical center or transfer from community hospital or patient's residence and patient refuses transport or due to unforeseen circumstances the patient unstable for pick-up, the Contractor will collect for the trip at the rates applicable under the schedule portion of this contract.  The VA reserves the right to substitute patients in these instances to prevent the "no-load" situation.

6.	NON-ARRIVAL OF PATIENT:  When ambulance service involves the pick-up of a patient scheduled to arrive by air and the ambulance driver finds such patient does not arrive as scheduled, the ambulance driver will contact the Travel Clerk, Supervisor, Patient Support Unit, or the AOD and inquire as to the status of the arrival.  If appropriate, waiting time may be authorized for time lost in waiting in accordance with the rate applicable under the schedule of costs of this contract.  If Contractor reported as scheduled and no patient is transported, Contractor will be reimbursed at the rates applicable under the schedule of costs of this contract.

7.	RATES:  Rates will apply twenty-four hours per day seven days a week.  Payment for mileage traveled beyond a base trip (25 miles) will be limited to "One Way Only" for the distance over which the patient is transported.  Such mileage costs will be paid in addition to the applicable rate per trip for any trip entirely within the county limits.  Trip mileage shall be determined by the latest edition of the Google Maps.  The Contractor shall receive the base rate quoted in the schedule for all one-way trips ordered.  The base rate shall constitute full compensation for one-way trips which do not exceed the mileage threshold as defined herein.  The Contractor shall also receive reimbursement of mileage charges for any mileage less than the mileage threshold.  

8.	TOLL CHARGES:  It is agreed and understood that the prices quoted in the Schedule do not include any ferry, bridge, tunnel or road toll charges.  Any such legitimate toll charges incurred shall be limited to ONE-WAY ONLY and shall be listed separately on Contractor's invoice.

9.	PROBLEMS IN TRANSPORT:  Any adverse events incurred during the transport of our patients will be recorded and reported to the Transportation Coordinator (TC) at the VA Maine Healthcare System, Augusta, Maine and recorded in the incident reporting system within 24 hours of transport.

10.	PATIENT WELFARE AND ABUSE: The contractor shall be held responsible for patient welfare during transport. The contractor shall be held responsible for patient and/or Government property during transport. Any damaged or lost wheelchairs, walkers, crutches or personal belongings will be replaced by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government or beneficiary.  The Government requires the contractor to exercise extreme caution and care in the handling of patients. Any abuse of patients will be grounds for default action or Termination of the contract.  In the event a patient's condition worsens during transport, the Contractor shall transport the patient to the closest facility appropriate for the required care. In the event a patient should expire during transport the Contractor shall return to the VA Medical Center. 

11.	DRUG BOX:  Emergency Drug Boxes will be provided by the awarded Contractor.  Drugs will be provided by VAMC Togus for drugs not approved by the Maine EMS Protocol (REFER TO:  http://www.maine.gov/dps/ems).

12.	NO IDLE POLICY: At no time will the Contractor leave vehicles on VA premises unless a pick-up or delivery is in process.  Once a patient has been removed from vehicle and properly secured with Emergency personnel, the running vehicle will be removed from the Emergency Department exit door to prevent environmental hazards due to exhaust fumes.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement for a bridge contract to continue engineering and technical support services in support of the Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) 3G MK 15 CIWS Program. As such, NAVSEA intends to award a sole source contract to Technology Service Corporation, 251 18th Street, S., Suite #705, Arlington, VA 22202. The Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract will be for their continuing Program Office's support engineering and technical services while a separate competition for these requirements is taking place. The intended sole source effort includes support services of quality, senior level engineering in Production/Overhaul Engineering, Design Engineering and Integrated Systems Engineering Management for the MK 15 CIWS Program. The Contractor will provide senior level professional services and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) in support of the Department of Defense requirements. This effort includes:
<p>1. Provide SME in Louisville, KY. Review contractor program documentation, including but not limited to reliability, maintainability, and quality assurance plans and analyses, and monitor application of results in the isolation and elimination of RMA&amp;QA issues. Review process data and conduct statistical analyses to evaluate adequacy of industrial process controls. Assess OEM and supplier quality programs for adequacy and compliance with Government and industry requirements. Plan and conduct quality audits at Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and supplier facilities. <br />2. Provide SME guidance to the definition of the Technical Refresh programs including attending the Raytheon internal peer reviews. Perform analyses of selected radio frequency and electro-optical tracking and firing data; evaluating track quality and system performance requirements. <br />3. Create and modify Reliability Block Diagram Models. Update Wartime Mission Profiles, and equipment use factors and subsystem duty cycle matrices as required. Provide subject matter expertise in analysis of CIWS Fleet and field failures, and present findings at Navy and Army data reviews.<br />4. Perform in depth engineering decision analysis and provide recommendations to the program office on alternative designs, product improvements, and engineering proposals. Employ tools, methods and procedures to assist in developing the recommendations. Provide the recommendations to the program office in technical papers.</p>
<p>The contract consists of a nine (9) month base with two (2) additional three (3) month option and will provide required services only until completion of the full and open competition for contractor support services to PEO IWS 3G, under the NAVSEA SEAPORT contracting initiative. The contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No other firm possesses the technical expertise, engineering background, or specific IWS 3G program expertise required to perform the effort in a cost effective manner and meet the required Fleet requirements and schedule. Any interruption in service will result in unacceptable risk to the United States Navy missile and could cause delays in responsiveness and therefore impact the procurement of the MK 15 CIWS. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for informational purposes only and for the benefit of potential subcontractors. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact TSC directly.</p>

(9F358), located in Norfolk, VA, is the only known Government approved source to
possess repair capability. The Government does not own the data or the rights to
the data needed to purchase this part from additional sources. It has been
determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is
uneconomical to reverse engineer the part. The Government did not initially
purchase the data and/or rights. Therefore, this item is sole source to Raytheon
Technical Services Company LLC, (9F358). Even though this item is sole source to
Raytheon Technical Services Company LLC, all responsible sources may submit a
capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the

However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this
combined synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the
Government not to compete this contract action based upon responses to this
notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received
will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to
conduct a competitive procurement. The subject items require Government source
approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the
technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via
full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government
for repair of these items is being solicited. The time required for approval of
a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval
of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together
with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP Source Approval
Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the
same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at
"https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps" or by
e-mailing the NAVSUP Buyer. If your request for source approval is currently
being evaluated at NAVSUP, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter
that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous
submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a
source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or
approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to
meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue
based on Fleet support needs. For any questions concerning this notice, contact
the Buyer, Rachel Sprinkle at Rachel.sprinkle@navy.mil.

ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control
activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or
knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate
source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the
source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been
solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an
approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information
detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source
Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx
Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data
required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your
offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the
Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this
solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the
ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award
of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at:

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
<p>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Havre, MT, that will be expiring and is considering remaining in the space under a succeeding lease under GSAR 570.402, but is interested in considering alternative space that meets the Government's requirements if such alternative space would be economically advantageous. In making its determination about whether alternative space is economically advantageous, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating to the alternative space, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  The Government will not consider expressions of interest it receives after the deadline established for the receipt of expressions of interest.</p>

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making this determination, the Government, will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.
<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease.  A fully serviced lease is required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is for the SHEP - DMCA 14A Dike Raising and Weir Improvements. This acquisition is being offered as a small business set aside and will result in a Fixed Price Contract Award. The construction magnitude for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.<br /> <br /> Description of Work: Savannah Harbor dredge material containment area (DMCA) 14A will be used primarily for disposal of the naturally occurring cadmium containing materials that will be excavated during dredging of the Savannah River as part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP). This project consists of raising the DMCA 14A perimeter back (marsh-side) dike, repairs and modifications to the three existing weir/water control structures across the front (river-side) dike, and removal of the DMCA 14A bird islands. An option to the base contract for raising the front dike is also included.
<p>The existing back dike currently spans a length of approximately 8,600 feet and has a crest elevation ranging from about 21 to 22 feet MLLW. After extending the interior counterweight/stability berm, the dike will be raised to a uniform crest elevation of 25 feet MLLW to gain additional capacity for containment of Savannah Harbor dredged material. During earthwork operations, the removal of some in-place materials along the exterior of the existing dike will be required. Repairs and modifications to the existing weirs will involve temporary removal, replacement of corroded steel, reinforcement of the outfall stub, the addition of a new bonneted knife gate valve, a new larger weir platform, a catwalk extension, and re-installation on a new slab foundation. The existing bird islands in the interior, southwest portion of the DMCA will also be removed and harvested for fill placement. The fill materials for raising the back dike will be obtained from the interior of DMCA 13A. A limited amount of fill material will also be available from the interior of DMCA 14A.</p>
<p>The existing front dike currently spans a length of approximately 6,400 feet and has a crest elevation ranging from about 25 to 29 feet MLLW. If the option is awarded, the front dike will be raised to a uniform crest elevation of 30 feet MLLW. The fill material for raising the front dike will be obtained from DMCA 13A.</p>
<p>RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF FACTORS</p>
<p>NON-COST FACTORS:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: PAST PERFORMANCE: This factor is equally important as FACTOR 2 and more important than FACTOR 3.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: CORPORATE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE: This factor is equally important as FACTOR 1 but more important than FACTOR 3.</p>
<p>FACTOR 3: SUMMARY SCHEDULE. This factor is less important that FACTOR 1 or FACTOR 2.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Background</span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The requirement is for the repair and testing of MSS/LER/LCC shock Isolators. The Shock Isolator is used in isolating the movement of the missile suspension system (MSS) the launcher equipment room (LER) floor and the launch control center (LCC) floor. The SIs are critical components of the United States Air Force, Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) ground support system. The shock isolators are currently repaired at Hill A.F.B, Utah. Because of the potential for increased demand the repair facilities at Hill A.F.B may not be able to keep up with the demand. These workloads will see an increase from 37 per yr. currently to 169 per yr. in FY18. There is a potential for about 50% of these needing to be outsourced for repair.</span></p>

<p>SOURCES SOUGHT/ REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Description: The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Rapid Acquisition Cell, Eglin AFB, is seeking interested and qualified sources to provide a Small Glide Munition (SGM) to the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Standoff Precision Guided Munition (SOPGM) capability that meets the attached operational requirement of the U.S. Special Operations Forces. Proposal are not being requested or accepted at this time. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332993 - Ammunition (except Small Arms) Manufacturing with a standard size of 1500 persons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14. Only interested firms who believe they are capable of providing the supplies and services noted in the SOW and can meet these requirements are invited to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement: All interested vendors shall submit a capabilities statement that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the effort in accordance with the attached SOW to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.

<DESC>This solicitation is a "REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)" only for the proposed contract action stated below. This Sources Sought Notice is not a request for formal proposals or quotes. It is neither a solicitation announcement nor a request for proposals or quotes and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.

Background Information
The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boise ID (VAMC) is the home of VISN 20's Optical Fabrication Lab (OFL), which manufactures in excess of 150,000 pairs of eyeglasses per year for eligible beneficiaries.  The OFL is a full-service facility that sources individual eyeglass components, and then grinds the lenses and assembles them into frames in-house.  The OFL currently manufactures eyeglasses for 51 Department of Veteran Affairs medical facilities and their outside clinics throughout the United States and its territories.  Many of these locations have a setup very similar to a commercial eyeglass retailer, complete with display racks from which veteran beneficiaries can browse, try-on, and select from available styles.

The government is in the preliminary phases of developing requirements for two sets of contracts, one each for eyeglass frames and lenses.  The information received in response to this RFI may be used to help formulate the government's overall contracting strategy for these potential contracts.  NAICS Code 339115, Ophthalmic Goods Manufacturing, with a size standard of 500 employees, has been identified as the NAICS code most likely to apply to this procurement.

Requested Information
The government is specifically interested in answers to the following questions regarding potential contractor capabilities:
1.	Is your company registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), and what is your DUNS?
2.	What is your business's size and socioeconomic status (VOSB, SDVOSB, woman-owned, etc.)?
3.	Are you a manufacturer or reseller of eyeglass frames and/or lenses?
4.	Where are the frames or lenses you provide manufactured (domestically or internationally)?
5.	What are your company's order handling capabilities to process daily orders (or more frequent)?
6.	What is your company's typical lead time for order delivery?
7.	What quality control standards does your company employ to ensure only high quality products are delivered?
8.	Could you please provide product literature that describes the assortment of products you sell (catalogs, etc.)?

Please feel free to provide any other information you feel may be pertinent to developing a strategy for a future contract.

Responses to this RFI
Responses to this RFI are requested to be in writing, either via mail or e-mail.  Interested parties are asked to respond by December 15, 2015 at 12:00 noon MDT.  Responses to information received are not guaranteed and should not be expected.

<DESC>This is a FedBizOpps (FBO) Request for Information (RFI) for a tentative requirement for Sign Language Interpreter Services for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). As part of its market research, BLS is issuing this RFI to determine if there exists an adequate number of qualified interested contractors capable of providing services as further described in the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Government may use the responses to this RFI for information and planning purposes. The Draft PWS describes only the currently contemplated possible scope of services and may vary from the work scope in a final PWS included in any Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP).&nbsp;&nbsp;This RFI uses the following NAICS Code: 541930 Translation and interpretation services.<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance includes a base year with four additional option years. However, this is subject to change and may be updated in any RFQ or RFP. <br /><br />All businesses may submit responses.<br /><br />This RFI is only for the purpose of identifying potential sources as part of BLS' market research. Neither a RFQ nor RFP exists.<br /><br />Responses to this RFI are not quotes or proposals for which BLS can issue any orders. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not itself constitute a RFQ or RFP. The Government does not intend to award contracts or Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) based only on responses to this RFI.<br /><br />All information received in response to this RFI marked "Proprietary" will be protected and handled accordingly. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.&nbsp; Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. BLS will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.<br /><br />There is no commitment by the Government to issue an RFQ or RFP, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.<br /><br />Please submit your Capability Statement, no longer than ten (10) pages. Include any relevant information on your company, DUNS number, and brief descriptions of recent and relevant projects for tasks similar to those in the Draft PWS. Your company should be able to provide the services as broadly described in the Draft PWS. However if your company is unable to meet all the tasks, please describe how you would address the remaining tasks either through subcontracts or new hires. If your small business has a small business designation, i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled, etc. please make sure that information is displayed.
<p>The BLS believes that structuring the pricing with two sets of rates, Standard Hours and Short Notice Hours, is the optimal category mix for the services described in the PWS, as it would allow the BLS to achieve maximum savings (page 29 of the Draft PWS). However, your company may also recommend a different mix of rate categories that allows the BLS to further maximize savings, i.e. one flat rate, three separate rates, etc. Such a mix shall be supported by substantive reasons and the recommendation shall be included in the last part of the Capability Statement. BLS is not concerned at this point with the specific pricing information, rather, what interested parties believe is industry standard or best practice. Recommendation regarding the mix shall not exceed one (1) page and does not count toward the ten (10) page limit for the Capability Statement. Thus, the maximum length of the Capability Statement with recommendation on labor mix shall not exceed eleven (11) pages.</p>
<p>Questions about this RFI are due in writing to Jason Liu at liu.jason@bls.gov no later than November 30, 2015 at 5:00 PM ET. Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Submit RFI responses to Jason Liu at liu.jason@bls.gov no later than December 4, 2015 at 5:00 PM ET. Do not submit pricing information in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>Please be aware, any contract or BPA awarded from this RFI can only be awarded to registered vendor(s) in the System for Award Management. For more information on registering, visit www.SAM.gov.</p>

<DESC>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br />Boulder, Colorado<br />Request for Information and Feedback on a DRAFT Statements of Work
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to create an early exchange of information with industry in order to promote a better understanding of current industry capabilities and obtain constructive recommendations in regards to potential future acquisitions. This RFI invites participation, by soliciting feedback from industry on strategic approaches to the enclosed Draft Statements of Work (SOW). All information presented herein is draft in nature and represents only notional thoughts on the part of the Government. Industry feedback from this RFI and other market research activities will assist the Government in developing final Acquisition Strategies.</p>
<p>Please note: The Government is seeking feedback on a SOW for TWO robotic systems for moving antennas positioning systems. These two systems must have a common control language, coordinate definition method, and safety interface between them. This SOW is for Multiple Robotic Positioners for Antennas which includes one Large Antenna Positioning System (LAPS) AND one optical-table top mounted Milli-Meter Wave Antenna Positioning System (mmWAPS).</p>
<p>NIST supports the Department's small business and socioeconomic goals and is especially interested in your firm's socioeconomic status. NIST Boulder is seeking the following information from all interested companies:</p>
<p>-Can a LAPS design be built to be installed and deployed into the provided room (24-1500) given the metal open floor area and 8 ft. x 44 ft. direct access to the concrete floor?</p>
<p>-We specify the ability of the robotic system (LAPS) to hold a 10-Kg probe at 2.9-3.5 meters off the ground and extended from the robot base while holding a 250, 150, or 100&micro;m deviation from a straight line over 8-9 m travel (see SOW for measurement details). Is this an achievable specification?</p>
<p>-Can the rail systems for the LAPS be integrated into the robot controller for a unified coordinate system?</p>
<p>-Can the axis of the rail system operate as a 7th axis in the controller coordinate system and be separately addressed for independent motion of the rail and robotic arm?</p>
<p>-Do the robots have the ability to be externally measured and individualized DH parameters be used in the robot controller for improved accuracy?</p>
<p>-Which subcontractors are being proposed for major components: <br />&bull;Stationary Robot<br />&bull;Moving Robot<br />&bull;Rail</p>
<p>-Are the triggering and latency specifications achievable?</p>
<p>-Are the ranges of movement for each robot (scan plane size, spherical angle range and radius) achievable?</p>
<p>-Are the nominal repeatability and load specifications for each robot and rail achievable?</p>
<p>-Is it possible for the robots to interface with YASKAWA INFORMS control language? NIST has extensive experience with INFORMS controlled robots that may interface with the LAPS and operational compatibility is a possible long-term consideration.<br />&bull;Can a NIST-owned YASKAWA MH50-35 with a DX100 controller be integrated into the LAPS coordinate system?</p>
<p>-Are the safety systems outlined sufficient to define a safe operating environment?</p>
<p>-Are the electrical connections and cable routing options specified correct and sufficient?<br />&bull;Do the vendors require more or different electrical connections?<br /><br />Relevant Technical Experience: Provide information that demonstrates the extent of your technical experience performing the same or similar work during the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>Your firm's Socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>-Are the requirements, as detailed within the attached Draft SOW's, defined sufficiently for your company to provide proposals on a firm fixed price basis?</p>
<p>-What areas of the SOW's do you recommend that the Government provide additional detail; what specific detail is recommended?</p>
<p>-What questions would you need answered in order to prepare a proposal?</p>
<p>-For the purpose of market research, provide the labor mix/categories most appropriate to perform the work for each SOW requirement?</p>

<DESC>Introduction <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background<br />The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), provides immunological and virological support for nonhuman primate (NHP) studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit contract sites (SVEUs) and by AIDS vaccine researchers through three Nonhuman Primate Immunology and Virology Laboratories for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development, previously called the NHP "Core Laboratories." The objective of the Core Laboratories has been to insure standardization and comparability of the assays conducted for preclinical NHP studies and to provide a common basis for assessment of the immunogenicity and efficacy of candidate HIV and SIV vaccines. The current Nonhuman Primate Core Cellular Immunology Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine Research and Development contract (HHSN272201000028C) is held by Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to support the development, conduct, and improvement of assays designed to evaluate and characterize the cellular immune responses of nonhuman primates that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV in studies conducted at the NIAID SVEU contract sites or by NIH-supported investigators.</p>
<p>Project requirements<br />The Contractor shall conduct, develop, acquire, improve, and implement assays to evaluate and characterize the cellular immune responses of nonhuman primates that have been immunized with candidate HIV or SIV vaccines or infected with SIV, SHIV, or HIV in studies conducted by the NIAID SVEUs or by investigators supported by or collaborating with NIH. Specifically, the Contractor shall: 1) perform immunological analyses; 2) receive, store, catalog, track, and maintain an inventory of the specimens for evaluation; 3) manage and report study data; 4) perform project management activities related to contract activities; 5) conduct initial and final transition activities, as needed; and 6) perform option work described below, if required.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one year options (terms that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally), for a total possible performance period of 7 years, beginning on or about June 1, 2017. The performance requirement will be the delivery of 6.0 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Years 2 through 7). Please note that the number of FTEs is inclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options to accommodate unanticipated increases in demand as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Options 7 through 20: Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 1.0 FTEs for each option exercised. These options may be exercised twice per year during Years 1 through 7. Please note that the number of FTEs is inclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Level of Effort will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>(2) Options 21 through 27: Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.5 FTE for each option exercised. It is anticipated that only one option will be exercised per performance year. Please note that the number of FTEs is inclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Level of Effort will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>(3) Options 28 through 34: Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the conduct of cellular immunology assays. Should the Government elect to exercise these options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume by 0.25 FTE for each option exercised. It is anticipated that only one option will be exercised per performance year. Please note that the number of FTEs is inclusive of subcontractor and consultant effort. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Level of Effort will not exceed the term of the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

<DESC><p>Disclaimer: This is not a solicitation. This is not a request for quote (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), request for application (RFA) or an announcement of a solicitation, and does not assume the Government will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitation efforts in the near future. This request is for information purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. All information considered proprietary shall be marked accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for improperly identified proprietary information. Properly identified proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with federal regulations. The purpose of this announcement is solely to gather information from the marketplace, and any responses received will neither be considered an offer by the responding party nor returned to the responding party. No telephone inquiries will be accepted, and requests for solicitation packages will not honored since no solicitation has been prepared.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of seeking sources capable of collecting and entering data from sablefish fishery logbooks.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: The proposed contract requirements require the vendor to have previously and current established trusted relationships with the Sablefish Longline industry. The information contained in logbooks collected by the samplers includes fishing locations, depths, dates, and gear descriptions that are highly guarded by fishing captains. These trade secrets for their fishing operations are considered sensitive and confidential, thus requiring the vendor of the proposed award to have current established trusted relationships with the Sablefish industry specifically.</p>
<p>The fishery data in these logbooks are collected for use in sablefish stock assessment. Services required include, but are not limited to: <br />1. Logbook collection in eight ports of landing in Alaska (Sitka, Kodiak, Petersburg, Seward, Dutch Harbor, St. Paul, Homer, Juneau) and one in Bellingham, Washington.<br />2. Dockside interviews with fishermen at time of landing, which includes logbook collection, signature of acknowledgement that the data is confidential, and editing of raw data to resolve discrepancies and illegible entries.<br />3. Entry of logbook data into an electronic format, including double data entry for quality control.<br />4. Query NMFS landing database to obtain official and confidential Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) landing trip reports.<br />5. Programmer time to organize and produce data in an electronic database format which links official IFQ landing reports to logbook trip entries.<br />6. Provide entire dataset to ABL in electronic format.</p>
<p>During each fishing season, the contractor is required to conduct approximately 600-800 dockside interviews with up to 250 vessels and from that collect an average of 1,000 log sheets. This represents a total of approximately 5,500 sets which are provided to ABL.</p>
<p>Background:<br /><br />The stock assessment of Alaska sablefish is closely scrutinized because of the high value of the fishery (ex vessel value over $100 million). Fishery data, along with survey data, is used to manage this fishery. Sablefish fishery data is obtained from these sources:<br />&bull; fishery data collected by observers since 1990 <br />&bull; voluntary logbooks since 1997 <br />&bull; required logbooks since 1999</p>
<p>Sablefish logbook fishery data is important for management and assessment of sablefish in Alaska because:<br />1. The Sablefish Logbook Program was initiated by sablefish fishermen's desire for NMFS to consider more fishery based information in the sablefish stock assessment. The sablefish stock assessment will be more credible if these data are collected and analyzed by NMFS in assessing sablefish abundance. If these data are not collected and analyzed, there will likely be increased scrutiny of sablefish management by the fishing industry. <br />2. Incorporation of more fishery data into the sablefish assessment has been promoted by the Scientific and Statistical Committee of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. <br />3. In 2000, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council endorsed the use of fishery data in the apportionment of the allowable catch to the management areas.<br />4. Fishery data is used as an index of abundance in the sablefish model that estimates population size.<br />5. The observer data collected covers about 25% of the catch by weight. The logbook program broadens coverage to about 50% of the catch. <br />6. Logbooks from vessels &lt;60ft in length that are voluntarily turned in to port samplers are the only source of data from vessels of this size. Much of the sablefish fleet is comprised of these vessels.</p>
<p>The preferred method for collecting logbook data is to interactively interview fishing vessel captains during fish deliveries to ensure reliability of data. This requires an established port sampling program in addition to a data entry and data verification system. This contract will provide a service to collect, enter, and verify fishery logbook data and provide summarized data to the Auke Bay Lab for use in the sablefish stock assessment.</p>
<p>Contractor's specialized experience must include the following:<br />1. Demonstrated understanding and knowledge of the longline fishery in Alaska, the sablefish fishing gear used, fishing techniques employed, the data fields, and the objectives of the log book program.<br />2. History and demonstrated ability to obtain captains' personal fishing logbooks, as well as an established trust-based working relationship between the fishing industry and fisheries management agencies.<br />3. Established dockside program, already in place.<br />4. Extensive expertise collecting logbooks from fisherman and analyzing longline logbook information.<br />5. Contractor must have previously and current established trusted relationships with the Sablefish Longline industry, directly related to dockside sampling.<br />6. Maintain a strict policy concerning confidentiality of logbook data, which cannot be subpoenaed or obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) due to protection under the International Organizations Immunities Act (USC 22, Section 228a).</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance September 1, 2016 - August 31, 2017with&nbsp;three (3) additional one-year options.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 and the small-business size standard is $15M.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding a fixed-price service contract for the sablefish fishery logbook project.</p>
<p>No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>Your response shall reference this Sources Sought number ABL-16022. Your response shall include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull;SBA designation (i.e. 8(a), HUBZONE, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, etc.), &bull;Business Name<br />&bull;CAGE Code<br />&bull;Name of point of contact<br />&bull;Email address<br />&bull;Phone and fax numbers<br />&bull;Size standard of company<br />&bull;All firms responding to this Sources Sought must articulate and detail their capabilities clearly and adequately by providing past experience that is similar to the size, scope and complexity of the requirements outlined in this synopsis. Firms should include a description of subcontracting, if any, that will be required to provide technically acceptable services for this requirement. <br /><br />** Responses must also detail out history of proven positive trusted relationships with the Sablefish industry</p>
<p>Telephone responses are NOT solicited and will not be accepted. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award a contract, nor will the Government pay for the solicited information.</p>
<p>Please submit your response via email to the attention of Ms. Suzanne Johnston (Suzanne.johnston@noaa.gov) no later than December 1, 2015 at 2:00 p.m. Alaska Standard Time. Each response shall be no more 8 single-sided, single-spaced pages (excluding the cover page), and each page shall be separately numbered.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Housing Counseling is issuing a Sources Sought Notice. The purpose of a Sources Sought Notice is to determine if there are two (2) or more capable Small Businesses that can perform the requirements of a planned contract. The Capability Statements received by our contracting office in response to this Sources Sought Notice may lead to a Small Business set-aside if two (2) or more Small Businesses can be determined by the Government to be capable of performing the work. If a set aside is achieved, the benefit to Small Business is competition that is restricted to only Small Businesses.<br /><br />This specific Notice is being issued to determine the capabilities within the small business community to provide research based evaluations of federal housing regulations and housing counseling initiatives. An assessment is needed to determine whether the rules that were promulgated and implemented were effective in achieving programmatic goals. Quantitative and Qualitative data need to be collected and then analyzed by a contractor; the assessment cannot be conducted until the raw data has been analyzed and interpreted. This effort will likely result in a Firm Fixed-Price Contract. The period of performance will be for a total of 5 years.&nbsp; One (12 month) base period and 4 (12 month) option periods. This is a new requirement; it will be the first time a contract has been planned for these services. The NAICS Code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $15 million.

<SUBJECT>Integrated Marketing Services for GSA FAS Training Event

<CONTACT>Nina Malakouti-Zamir, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone 7036052742, Email nina.malakouti@gsa.gov - Steven Roberts, Event Management Specialist, Email steven.roberts@gsa.gov
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RIF).  Interested vendors should provide their responses including capabilities statement to the POCs identified on this notice by no later than 4:00pm (1600 Hrs) November 30, 2015.<br />General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Office of Customer Accounts and Research (CAR) is issuing this RFI to solicit responses from interested vendors concurrently via FedBizOpps and GSA eBuy (Schedule SIN 541-5).  <br />GSA's Office of Customer Accounts and Research is responsible for organizing training conference and exhibition events.  In years past the largest such effort was known as the GSA Training Conference and Expo (herein called GSA Expo).  The GSA Expo was an annual three (3) day event attended by approximately 6,000 attendees from U.S. Government Agencies including the military along with state and local government participation and approximately 3,000 exhibitors exhibiting at 700+ event spaces.  Due to overall government travel and budget restrictions, GSA Expo was cancelled in 2013 and 2014.  There is renewed interest in resurrecting the former GSA Expo however not to the size and scope of former events.  <br />For the GSA Expo, GSA's objective was to educate both exhibitors (GSA contractors) and GSA's customer agencies (Federal civilian agencies, the military and State and Local Government).  The education included showcasing the latest products and services available, and conducting acquisition training courses that met the criteria for continuing learning points (CLPs) required under the Clinger-Cohen and Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) for contracting officers and program managers.  The management goal was to attract buyers and people who influence acquisition decisions at a GS-12/rank-equivalent and higher. <br />The expected outcome was to enhance Agency customers' understanding of existing GSA commercial supply and service solution contracts thru extensive training sessions and achieve interaction between agency attendees and GSA vendors on the exhibit floor.  From this, agency attendees would leave the GSA Expo realizing the wide availability and ease of accessibility of existing contract sources - and use these contract vehicles to meet their agency needs rather than duplicate the contracts.  GSA's goal was that attendees from each event would leave with the elevated awareness of the existence of GSA/FAS contract solutions and that these solutions were the preferred source and best value for commercial products and services to the Federal Government and State and Local Governments.<br />The GSA Expo event complied with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requirements regarding government employee conference training as defined in 5 C.F.R. 410.404.  Moving forward it is intended to completely support the intent and spirit of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) letters directed to all chief acquisition officers and senior procurement executives encouraging government interaction with industry, as well as effective training and development of the government acquisition workforce and new requirements for the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C). This guidance stresses "early, frequent, and constructive engagement with industry, [which] leads to better acquisition outcomes" and strongly supports participation in professional organizations and/or their events. <br />The GSA Expo event also aims to meet the intent and spirit of Department of Defense guidance outlined within the Better Buying Power initiative pertaining to increasing the professionalism of the acquisition workforce. <br />Finally, our GSA Expo event content aims to reach outside the Washington DC Metropolitan area to provide more direct field office interaction with FAS leaders of key government-wide initiatives (such as category management, strategic sourcing, Acquisition Gateway) - initiatives that have significant and beneficial impact to the federal acquisition community<br />In general terms, the contractor will assist with the pre-event, at-event and post-event activities for a condensed version of the former GSA Expo.  Activities would include planning, budget development, event production and administration, site selection, integrated marketing and communications, a/v support, logistical support, etc.  Activities would not include course development or instructors - these will be developed and provided by GSA.<br />These activities are to be provided via a combination of no-cost and firm fixed prices.  As such, GSA's outcome is to provide an event with no actual cost to the U.S. Government.  These no-cost services shall be paid from revenue received from the sale of exhibit booth space.  <br />The management objective is to allow the offeror the maximum flexibility to innovatively manage the full service of planning, budget development, event production and administration, site selection, integrated marketing and communications, a/v support, logistical support, etc. <br />The one-to-two-day event in March, April or May 2016 would require a venue in the Huntsville, AL Metropolitan Area to accommodate 1,500 - 2,500 attendees, space for 100 to 200 tabletop and/or 10x10 exhibit booth spaces, one large meeting room with seating for up to 2,500 and 30 - 50 meeting rooms with seating for 50 - 75 to conduct training sessions. <br /><br />Interested vendors must submit their responses to the attention of GSA Contracting Officer, Nina Malakouti, at nina.malakouti@gsa.gov.

<DESC><p><strong>PROPOSED REQUIREMENT TITLE:</strong> HHS-BARDA-Sources Sought - Respiratory Illness Live Virus Fill / Finish Services<br /><br /><br />___________________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY</strong><br /><br /><br /><br />The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone, service-disabled, veteran-owned , 8(a), woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325414. The small business size standard is 500 employees. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a small business set-aside is a possibility.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential small business sources to fulfill the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately. All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.<br /><br />The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has a future requirement to establish Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish capabilities to facilitate Live Virus/ Vectored Vaccine Medical Countermeasure (MCM) product development towards licensure. BARDA has a specific need to create core services to support cGMP and non-GMP filling and finishing of a variety of Medical Countermeasure products; small molecule, large molecule, live virus, lyophilized, pre-clinical, clinical, at pilot and commercial scale. BARDA needs Live Virus/ Vectored Vaccine Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish core services for BARDA-sponsored product developers and manufacturers that may not have the appropriate or adequate manufacturing facilities or expertise. Additionally, during a public health medical emergency, Medical Countermeasure Fill / Finish services beyond current Government capacities may be needed to provide finished products rapidly to address the medical emergency. Through a set of contractual agreements, BARDA will establish Fill / Finish Manufacturing capabilities and capacities in order to provide a wide-array of live virus/ vectored vaccine product services to meet BARDA requirements. BARDA will coordinate the activities as they are awarded under this IDIQ contract.<br /><br />As directed by Task Order(s), contractors would provide fill and finish services to support the development of live virus/ vectored vaccine Medical Countermeasure candidates and/or other MCMs as identified. Once the contractor is established as a live virus/vectored vaccine fill and finish service provider, other services may be requested via task order. Examples of other products which could potentially be requested are small molecule sterile injectables, large molecule sterile injectables, monoclonal antibodies, pre-clinical, clinical, and FDA approved MCMs. Fill / Finish services can also be requested for rapid response during a public health emergency. Expectations of Fill / Finish services and timelines will be specified in the Task Order (e.g. routine or urgent). Contractors will provide a wide range of fill and finish services, relevant to BARDA's vision to create a nation with the capability to respond quickly and effectively to natural and emerging threats by providing a range of fill and finish services, which can be used by BARDA and BARDA's development partners.</p>
<p><strong><br /><br />The two objectives of the potential requirement are as follows:</strong><br /><br /><strong>Objective 1: Fill / Finish Services:</strong> Contractors shall provide technology transfer and fill and finish services of live virus/ vectored vaccine and other types of MCM products that include the capability to process clinical investigational lots, engineering lots, process validation lots, and commercial-scale lots. Services may include, but are not limited to: technology transfer, lyophilization development, analytical testing, process optimization, process validation, formulation, filling, labeling, packaging, and distribution.<br /><br />Services may be provided to support the fill and finish of pharmaceuticals including parenteral drug products, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, antitoxins, and vaccines. As per the USG requirement, these liquid, lyophilized, or powder drug products may be filled and finished as prefilled syringes or sprayers, cartridges, auto-injectors, single dose or multi-dose vials.<br /><br /><strong>Objective 2: Rapid MCM Response Readiness:</strong> Contractors shall augment the existing US-based vaccine fill and finish infrastructure surge capacity for medical countermeasures, emerging infectious diseases, and other threats of known and unknown origin during a public health emergency, as described in Objective I. Once a public health emergency has been declared, the Contractor shall provide fill and finish services in response to a USG T/DOR.

<DESC>NOTICE TEXT: Department of the Air Force Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA). The AFLCMC/HBAK Landing Systems Branch intends to negotiate a modification to the current contract awarded to Thales ATM, US of Clarksburg, MD on or about 10 July 2016 for the production of up to three additional Deployable Instrument Landing System (D-ILS), depending upon funding.
<p>This synopsis is for a proposed modification, IAW FAR 5.201(b)(i), for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "only one (1) responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Thales is the only firm capable of meeting the Government's requirement for the Deployable Instrument Landing System to be delivered, fully installed, tested, accredited, and accepted by the Government, within thirty six (36) months from date of award, without a substantial duplication of costs or unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>The modification will be a Fixed-Price with an anticipated additional 18 month period of performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort is 334511. The D-ILS is being procured and will address the operational requirements for an ILS system that can provide precision guidance to aviation assets in multiple geographically separated and environmentally diverse regions. Each system will provide guidance based on the aircraft's position in relation to the final approach course (azimuth) and the glide path (elevation) from the touchdown point on the runway or landing surface. With D-ILS, the USAF will have a supportable, adaptable, resilient, enduring/persistent precision approach capability that all joint, coalition and civil ILS-equipped aircraft will be able to use worldwide. The D-ILS will provide significantly improved reliability, maintainability and supportability over legacy deployable Precision Approach Radar (PAR) systems.</p>
<p>This will be a sole source procurement conducted in accordance with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 and FAR 15.4. In addition, it will be supplemented by the DFARS, AFFARS and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures. <br />This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Interested parties may submit a capabilities statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Government to the identified point of contact no later than 3 December 2015, 2:00 PM, ET. Such capabilities will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this NOCA nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to HBAK. This notice is not a commitment from the Government.</p>
<p>An AFLCMC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The AFLCMC Ombudsman can be contacted at the following telephone number: (937) 255-5472 or email: jill.willinghamallen.1@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Plant Protection Quarantine (PPQ) in Fort Collins, CO intends to award a sole source, Purchase Order to NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY for Web Access to a Dairy Herd Improvement Association Data Base which is a data capture source for dairy herd and productivity parameters in the U.S. <br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1
<p>The supplies or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy these needs.</p>
<p>National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) has been working with 2 of Dairy Herd Improvement Association 's (DHIA) 4 Dairy Records Processing Centers (DRPC) to get access to their herd level summary data. Two of the DRPCs (Dairy Records Management System - ORMS, and AgSource) represent 16,000 dairy herds (- 35% of U.S. dairy operations) and 2.5 million dairy cows (- 25% of U.S. dairy cows) from across the U.S. NAHMS analyzes this data (over 200 variables per herd) to evaluate changes in the industry and to assess surveillance activities. For the last 2 years, ORMS and AgSource have provided the data on a monthly basis at no charge. Starting August 2014, however, ORMS with the largest number of herds (- 13,000) will begin charging for the data: tiny_mce_marker.25 per herd/month. This charge is significantly less than what DRPC charges other stakeholders for data (&gt;$1.00 per herd/month).<br />NAHMS dairy studies gather information on the industry every 5 to 7 years. To get more current and ongoing information about the dairy industry, NAHMS has the opportunity to continue receiving data from DHIA to assist in dairy cattle health and monitoring. The normal charge for these data is &gt;$1.00 per herd/month DRMS and AgSource have agreed to a discounted rate of tiny_mce_marker.25 per herd/month. Negotiations are underway for the other 2 DRPCs.<br /><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Central Time (CT) on the closing date of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 519130 (Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals). The Small business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered.

<p>In 2014, the FBI purchased two (2) InfiniteFocus SL Measurement Systems from the Alicona Corporation.

Because of the high frequency and importance of bullet measurements, the FBI needs to implement a technology that will improve the speed and accuracy of bullet measurements.

This additional hardware and software will allow the system to accomplish IF-MultiMeasurement, IF-Real3DMeasurement, IF-Real3dFusion, and IF-Real3DRotationUnit G2.</p>

<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information.

Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. 

Hard-rock mines are defined as non-fuel, metallic and certain non-metallic mining activities that have been found at existing CERCLA response sites.  Examples of mine types that are included in this definition include surface mines (open pits, strip mines, dredged mines), underground mines (shafts and tunnels) and/or in situ mines for one or more of the following: Antimony, Arsenic, Asbestos, Chrome, Cobalt, Copper, Cadmium, Gold, Iron, Lead, Magnesium, Mercury, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Palladium/Platinum Group, Phosphate rock, Platinum, Rare Earth Elements, Selenium, Silver, Sulfur, Tin, Titanium, Tungsten, Uranium, Vanadium, and Zinc.

This contract also includes mine-related facilities where the extraction, beneficiation and processing of the above metals and certain non-metallic, non-fuel minerals has occurred, including smelters, mine leachates/runoff, hazardous chemicals (e.g. perchlorate/ANFO from explosives), leaching pond solutions, waste rock/tailings piles, overburden, tailings disposal areas, sediments in stream channels/lakes, tailings impoundments, holding ponds/lagoons, pit lakes, retention dams, injection/extraction wells, etc...

This contract excludes certain mine types such as: coal, sand and gravel, dimension stone, crushed stone, clay pits, quarries, and salt. 

	The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This procurement envisions the award of one (1) Architect and Engineering Services (AES) contract under a small business set-aside. The contract will be fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), award-term contract. Fixed rate in this procurement means the labor rates will be negotiated and fixed at the contract level, inclusive of indirect costs, with the allowance for escalation for future out-years based on an agreed-upon escalation clause in the contract. The base period of performance will be three (3) years, with award term periods of three (3) years, and four (4) years, for a potential total period of ten (10) years. Work will be issued by Time and Materials, Fixed Price, or Hybrid Task Orders. The total estimated capacity of this proposed contract, including award terms, is $213,831,000.00. This capacity is estimated to be divided between Regions 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10 as follows: 

Region 4: $2,400,000.00
Region 6: $24,000,000.00
Region 8: $28,740,000.00
Region 9: $135,468,000.00
Region 10: $23,223,000.00

This is a projection only, hence the estimated capacity may differ from the actual realized capacity.

	The contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 36 and the Brooks Act Procurement procedures. Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330 (SF 330) to Fedconnect.net by January 22, 2016 at 5 p.m. PST.

	This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). In accordance with FAR Part 36.6, following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed. Short-listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms." Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations. The specific details on the oral presentations will be provided to only the selected firms. Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations. Following oral presentations, the proposals will then be ranked and the source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms. The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan, Health and Safety Plan, and Representations and Certifications. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards. If the Government elects to make multiple awards, the firms in the competitive range will be informed of the fair opportunity competition process for task orders, at the time the selected firms are asked to submit their cost proposal. The contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs.

EPA is not limited to the past performance references submitted by the offeror. EPA may seek information for this criterion from the offeror's clients it identifies through other means. Past projects will be evaluated on relevancy of work performed and dollar value of the project. For the purposes of this factor, previous projects involving mine sites, or mine-related sites, will be seen as the most relevant type of work and projects above $1 million will be the most relevant dollar value. The technical aspects of previous mine related projects will determine the relevancy, regardless of whether or not the work was performed for EPA or directly on a Superfund site.
If proposing as a team, EPA will evaluate the past performance of the individual companies (i.e. prime contractor and subcontractor) and may also evaluate the past performance information that exists for the team. For example, if two offerors have formed a joint venture and past performance information is available for that joint venture based on other projects, the individual companies will be evaluated in addition to the past performance information available for the joint venture.

The offeror shall demonstrate its ability/capacity to staff the contract with experienced trained personnel at the appropriate levels and disciplines in an effective and timely manner. The offeror will be evaluated on current and projected workload commitments. The offeror shall demonstrate how it intends to comply with FAR 52.219-14(c)(1):  Services (except construction), at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.

EVALUATION AND SCORING
Offerors' responses will be evaluated accordingly:

Factors 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 will be evaluated using the following adjectival rating scheme.  Factor 4 will be evaluated through past performance references and receive a commensurate adjectival score.

Unsatisfactory  = Information related to this factor is addressed, but contains deficiencies and/or weaknesses that can be corrected only by major or significant changes to relevant portions of the proposal, or the factor is addressed so minimally or vaguely that there are widespread information gaps. In addition, because of the deficiencies, weaknesses, and/or information gaps, serious concerns exist on the part of the Architect-Engineer Evaluation Board (AEEB) about the offeror's ability to perform the required work.

Marginal = Information related to this factor is incomplete, unclear, or indicates an inadequate approach to, or understanding of the factor. The AEEB believes that there is question as to whether the offer would be able to perform satisfactorily.

Satisfactory = Information related to this factor is adequate. Overall, it meets the specifications and requirements, such that the AEEB believes that the offeror could perform to meet the Governments minimum requirements.

Very Good = Information related to this factor is acceptable, with some superior features. Information provided is generally clear, and the approach is acceptable with the possibility of more than adequate performance.

Exceptional = Information related to this factor is superior in most features.

All questions related to this acquisition must be submitted electronically to Fedconnect.net no later than November 30, 2015 at 10 a.m. PST. EPA will consolidate the questions and post the answers to Fedconnect.net. Additional information for this requirement may be found on Fedconnect.net.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to extend contract number SS00-10-60080 with the Iron Mountain Information Management LLc, One Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110 on a sole source basis for a period of four months to provide continued offsite data storage and disaster recovery. The Social Security Administration is preparing to re-compete this contract, but has experienced delays. A short-term extension to the existing contract is being sought based on the need to continue services in order to mitigate the risk of potential loss of data. The 4-month extension will cover the period of 02/01/2016 through 05/31/2016. This procurement is being made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
The sole source is based on the source's unique ability to provide the continued services. As the incumbent contractor, Iron Mountain Information Management  LLC has  a designated vault area for SSA tapes already established.  They have an inventory of tapes already in storage.  They have a cadre of employees and drivers that have been cleared. Iron Mountain has facilities and vehicles that meet the criteria in the contract to ensure protection of the tapes and sensitive data they hold. The procurement process, learning curve, tape transition, and clearance process of a new contractor would take almost the entire four month period of the extension.  Therefore, it is in the Government?s best interest to utilize Iron Mountain for the extension.   
This is not a formal solicitation. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that the required capability is available from other sources and competition would be advantageous to the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement , proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. If no affirmative written response is received, the procurement will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address by 9:00 am EST, December 7, 2015: brenda.monch@ssa.gov.

<p>2.

<p>The NAICs code for this requirement is 541320 - Offices of Real Estate Appraisers</p>
<p>I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Office of Real Property Utilization and Disposal (RPUD) provides cost effective, timely, and professional appraisal and related services to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and to other federal landholding agencies on a reimbursable basis. Services include appraisals in support of disposals, acquisitions, exchanges, and outgrants (leases, easements, licenses and permits), reviews of third party appraisals reports, and consultations. Consulting services include feasibility studies, highest and best use analysis, marketability studies, asset and utilization evaluations, property parcelization recommendations, Enhanced Use Leasing (EUL) feasibility and valuation support, and other related real estate services.</p>
<p>RPUD has a nationwide staff of professional review appraisers with experience preparing technical contract specifications, selecting the most qualified contract appraiser at a reasonable price, and preparing the required Government review of the contract appraisal. RPUD appraisers have extensive experience with the high valued, complex, and controversial assignments involving a wide variety of property types. RPUD contract appraisers could include sole proprietors, partners, corporations, and several other types of business structures.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, TX is home to the Region 7 Real Property Utilization and Disposal Division (7PZ), which is a zonal office of RPUD that encompasses a 15-state zone including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana.</p>
<p>In order to streamline the procurement process, and provide timely service to internal and external customers, GSA is considering issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an IDIQ contract for appraisals and appraisal-related services as mentioned above.</p>
<p>GSA is issuing this RFI to obtain responses from appraisal firms and other members of the valuation community in regard to the questions posed in Section II below.</p>
<p>II. QUESTIONS</p>
<p>1. As mentioned in Section I above, 7PZ encompasses a 15-state geographic territory. Appraisal and appraisal-related assignments could be required in any metropolitan area, as well as any rural area within those 15 states, border to border. GSA is seeking the interest of appraisal firms, as well as those in the valuation community, who would be willing and capable of covering as much of that 15-state area as possible. Within that 15-state territory, where would you be willing to work? For instance, the entire territory, certain states, certain metropolitan areas, etc.? Please be specific and list each of the 15 states your firm is willing to work, including metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>2. As mentioned in Question 1 above, appraisal and appraisal-related services could be required in any location within 7PZ's 15-state territory. This oftentimes requires travel to remote and rural areas. Are you willing to travel to rural and remote areas to complete appraisal assignments? Please include any travel restrictions your firm may have.</p>
<p>3. As mentioned in Section I above, RPUD review appraisers seek to select the most qualified appraiser at a reasonable price. When asked for a cost estimate for an appraisal assignment, how is the cost estimate relayed to the requestor? For example, for the fair market value (FMV) appraisal of a 10,000 square foot single tenant office warehouse in a large metropolitan area where you currently conduct business, would you provide a daily rate, total estimated cost per project, or provide pricing in some other way?</p>
<p>4. As mentioned in Question 1 above, appraisal services may be needed in any location within 7PZ's 15-state territory. Additionally, the subject of these assignments include all types of real estate, all types of value, and every interest in real estate. For example, past projects have included, but are not limited to, historic federal buildings, missile siles, residential homes, environmentally contaminated property, easements, mineral rights, air rights, vacant land, large industrial facilities, and many others. What types of property do you have experience appraising?</p>
<p>III. SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES</p>
<p>All interested parties should submit a cover sheet, and responses to the above four questions listed in Section II, clearly marked "Response to RFI - IDIQ Procurement of Real Property Appraisals" . <strong>Responses are due by 5:00 PM central time on December 21, 2015</strong> and submitted via email to terri.marshall@gsa.gov. Submissons are limited to five pages for responses to the four questions, one side per page, plus an additional page for the cover sheet for a total of six pages.</p>
<p>GSA would like to thank you in advance for reviewing this RFI and assisting us in our efforts to plan for the potential IDIQ procurement.</p>

<DESC>SPACE AND NAVAL WARFARE SYSTEMS COMMAND (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office  Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO-C4I), Command and Control (C2) Program Office (PMW 150), intends to procure Command and Control Systems (C2PS) to meet urgent fleet Technology Refresh (TR) upgrades, Ship New Construction (SCN) initial deliveries, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) commitments.  The purpose of this synopsis is to announce that components of the C2PS will be brand-name items, which will be justified through a Class J&A under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1) and FAR part 6.302-1(c).  The component list identifies the brand-name part manufacturer, model/part number, and item description as prescribed in the C2PS Technical Data Package (TDP).   The Command and Control Processor (C2P) hardware and software architecture constraints require these brand-name parts for successful operation.  The Government has experienced unacceptable re-certification cost, schedule growth and increased technical risk due to the substitution of these parts in the past.  The Government anticipates procuring approximately 109 different brand-name items for use in about 201 C2P systems that will be procured competitively under existing multiple award IDIQ and future contracts through the end of 2027.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement with the following information:  1. Company name, company address, CAGE code, point of contact, e-mail address, and telephone number.  2. A Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet that traces the Government part, the proposed substitute part, and detailed part specifications that describes how the proposed part meets or exceeds the following requirements:  The part has been successfully Grade A certified for MIL-STD-901D, dated 17 March 1989; MIL-STD-167A, dated 30 June 1993 certified; and MIL-STD-1680 certified. The part has been successfully certified interoperable with the Command and Control Processor (C2P) software architecture.  Responses are required no later than 15 calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  Responses shall be submitted to Lindsay Taelman at lindsay.taelman@navy.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete the procurement of the specified brand-name parts based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government is not seeking marketing material and any information provided beyond what is specified above will not be considered by the Government.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.

<SOLNBR>W9126G-16-R-0018
<RESPDATE>122115
<ARCHDATE>01052016
<CONTACT>Maria E. Rodriguez, Contract Specialist, Phone 4097666331, Fax 409 766-3010, Email maria.e.rodriguez@usace.army.mil - CELIA E. COCKBURN, CONTRACT OFFICER, Phone 4097663067, Email celia.e.cockburn@usace.army.mil
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District, PO Box 1229, Galveston, Texas, intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Weston Solutions Inc., 5599 San Felipe St., Houston, Texas, to modify the existing Rio Grande Valley (RGV) DeLeon Gate system to accommodate the safe passage of farm equipment through the Border Fence between the United States of America and Mexico onto and off of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) levee by local landowners which will enable closure of the opening in the existing Border fence referred to as the "Flores Gap" located in Brownsville, Texas. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii): "For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of suppliers with unique capabilities."
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code 237310 Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction the size standard is $36,500.000.00.</p>
<p>The work will consist of reducing the grade of the existing gate access ramp by extending the ramp through the existing gate opening. This will require elevating the existing gate system (structure and electrical/mechanical components) so that the gate closes flush across the access ramp to prevent unauthorized access through the Border Fence. Accordingly, these modifications will necessitate new foundations for the elevated gate structure; elevated operating platforms for the gate operating system; a retaining wall for the access ramp; fabrication and installation of fence for closure of the Flores Gap and the full disassembly of the existing gate system to include the structural, mechanical and electrical systems including the custom designed and built DoorKing gate operating system. The contractor shall plan, design, and procure all necessary materials and construct and field test the modifications to the DeLeon Gate system to verify to the satisfaction of the Government that the system functions as originally designed.</p>
<p>The existing RGV DeLeon Gate system was designed, fabricated and constructed by Weston Solutions, Inc. to the unique and stringent criteria of the Department of Homeland Security. Weston Solutions is the designer of record of the RGV Gates and holds the five year warranty on the DoorKing Gate Operating System which is an integral component of the existing RGV DeLeon Gate system. This particular DoorKing model, DK 9600 was designed and manufactured specifically for the Border Fence 50ft gates. The Government is currently in the second year of the five year warranty of the aforementioned system. In order to ensure the integrity of the gate system and for the warranty to remain enforceable any work performed on the existing RGV DeLeon Gate's DoorKing Operating System must be performed by an authorized DoorKing certified service provider with firsthand knowledge and experience with this custom designed gate operating system. The RGV Gates including the DeLeon Gate have been under warranty by Weston Solutions since they were placed into service approximately two years ago. Consequently, the only authorized DoorKing certified service provider to work on the RGV Gates has been Weston Solutions, Inc. Accordingly, work performed by any other contractor would void the warranty and could leave the DeLeon Gate inoperable since they do not have the knowledge or experience with these unique custom gate systems.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 2:00 p.m. 21 Dec 2015, by email to the attention of Maria E. Rodriguez at maria.e.rodriguez@usace.army.mil Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM to receive government contracts. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information.</p>

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Surface Forces Logistics Centers, Long Range Enforcer - Contracts &amp; Procurement Branch 2, Oakland, CA anticipates awarding SOLE SOURCE procurement to Walz and Krenzer, Inc. for the following supplies:
<p>1. Complete Cargo Hatch per WK drawing D-WK-831-1. Assembly to<br />include new panel, new frame/coaming assembly, and hydraulic actuators and<br />components located on the hatch panel. Frame/coaming assembly to be<br />supplied with select components that are prone to excessive corrosion made out<br />of stainless steel.<br />Qty: 01</p>
<p>2. Hydraulic Manifold Assembly per D-WK-831-6<br />Qty: 01</p>
<p>3. Electrical Logic Connection similar to Box D-WK-831-11<br />Qty: 01</p>
<p><br />Walz and Krenzer, Inc. is the only source of supply that manufactures the cargo hatch. This cargo hatch is engineered to allow the operator stay safe while using this heavy hydraulic cargo hatch. If another company would supply the cargo hatch differently the engineering process would need to be repeated to check for functionality. This cargo hatch is needed to keep the same configuration throughout the Coast Guard 225' buoy tender fleet. Any attempt to manufacture the listed item without the proper specifications, drawings, and technical data could cause a misalignment and damage the cargo hatch assembly. Any failure of a substituted item would jeopardize the engineering manufactured on the proprietary information.</p>
<p>CGC Oak is a 225' buoy tendor. Vendor will provide all labor and parts listed in the Schedule. NAICS Code 332312 applies to this procurement. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. No solicitation will be issued, however all responses received on/before 0800 AM PST 26NOV2015 will be reviewed by the Government. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

POSITION TITLE: INL Corrections Advisor<br />6. MARKET VALUE: $82,350 - $120,934 (FS-02 Equivalent)<br />7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year from date of award, with four optional years<br />8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Islamabad, Pakistan<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues, including corrections, for the Department of State (DOS). INL's corrections programs are overseen by the Bureau's Corrections Team Lead based in Washington, DC, Office of Civilian Justice Assistance and Partnership (INL/CAP) and the Bureau's Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP); and managed by the INL office in Islamabad, Pakistan (INL-Pakistan).</p>
<p>In October 2009, INL's Corrections Team Lead conducted an assessment of the corrections system in Pakistan and produced a written assessment with recommendations. The assessment concluded that Pakistan's overcrowded and crumbling prison system faces many challenges, but is not in a state of imminent collapse. The system is administered by the provinces with little federal support or guidance and is at more than double its capacity. This is because the system is filled with pre-trial detainees awaiting their court date in the country's clogged court system. Pre-trial detainees can wait for years to go to court, even for minor crimes. The prison staff is poorly trained, underpaid, and lack full control of facilities and prisoners. The current anti-militant campaign has implications for the system, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan, and Sindh provinces. A growing influx of dangerous and hard to manage detainees, coupled with two successful outside attacks on prisons in KP that liberated more than 400 prisoners, including approximately 35 militant leaders, in 2012 and 2013, threatens to push the system closer to a crisis point. This challenging situation has received high level attention and has prompted the U.S. Government (USG) to work to assist the Government of Pakistan with meaningful corrections reforms and improvements.</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />The Corrections Advisor will serve as an in-country advisor responsible for implementing INL-Pakistan's corrections assistance efforts. S/he will oversee the development and expansion of INL's Pakistan Corrections Program in coordination with other USG, international and Pakistan law enforcement and criminal justice programs. This includes, but is not limited to, coordination with Pakistani authorities, management of corrections training, logistical and security planning, vendor/contractor coordination, and commodity provision to host nation correctional sector entities. The Corrections Advisor will work within Embassy Islamabad under the direct supervision of the INL-Pakistan Director or his/her designee. The Corrections Advisor will serve as INL's corrections subject matter expert in Pakistan, and provide expertise on all aspects of corrections matters in Pakistan, including, but not limited to: corrections personnel training and curriculum, prisoner classification; prison administrative procedures and information systems; prisoner reintegration, rehabilitation and disengagement programs including vocational and educational opportunities; appropriate management of vulnerable groups, including women, juveniles, and the mentally and physically ill; prison census and files, human rights issues related to prisoner incarceration; strategic planning and budgeting; and refurbishment and/or construction of correctional facilities.</p>
<p>DUTIES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES<br />In close coordination with INL-Pakistan staff and INL/CAP, the Corrections Advisor will be expected to perform the following duties:<br />Program Planning and Management<br />&bull; Manage corrections projects under the guidance and direction of the INL-Pakistan Director and Deputy Director (or designee) and INL/CAP and keep them informed of the details of such implementation, including progress, challenges, and recommended solutions. Perform monitoring and evaluation of assistance projects.<br />&bull; Work with the INL-Pakistan Director or designee to oversee budgets for training, equipment, and other assistance.<br />&bull; Provide program guidance and frequent status updates on the implementation and development of the INL Corrections Program to the INL-Pakistan Director and Deputy Director (or designee) as well as the INL-Pakistan and INL/AP Corrections Program Officers, including progress, challenges, and recommended solutions. <br />&bull; Ensure programming complies with USG requirements and legal restrictions, including Leahy vetting, and is coordinated with related USG police, criminal justice, and rule of law assistance and programs.<br />&bull; Ensure that programming meets both U.S. and Government of Pakistan policy objectives and priorities, maintaining an open dialogue with Government of Pakistan corrections officials and exploring opportunities to partner with new corrections entities as directed by INL leadership.<br />&bull; As directed by the INL-Pakistan Director or designee, contribute to the production of a written weekly report on status of the INL Pakistan corrections efforts including - but not limited to - activities, progress, challenges, and recommended solutions. <br />&bull; Provide direction and supervision to the locally hired corrections assistants. Collect information for trend analysis of program efficacies.<br />&bull; Coordinate USG corrections assistance efforts with the international donor community, including, but not limited to the International Committee for the Red Cross and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.</p>
<p>Policy Analysis<br />&bull; Develop a detailed strategy and implementation plan and timeline for the Pakistan Corrections Program.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Quoters shall identify the length of past experience relevant to each of the six market sectors. <br /><br /><strong>&bull; Sub-factor 3: Demonstrations</strong></p>
<p>After an initial review of the written technical submissions, and at its sole option, FHFA may require Quoters to provide an on-line demonstration of their website functionality and capability. If conducted, Quoters shall demo their web-based research and relevant information including specific features, functionality, and capabilities to support a wide coverage of individual counterparties and structured finance securities within each of the six market sectors specified in the SOW. Quoters shall also demonstrate how to search for and download credit research, analysis, and relevant data for each of the six market sectors from their websites.</p>

<p>If Quoter demonstrations are conducted, the Contracting Officer will provide as much notice as practical to schedule the demonstration and provide relevant details regarding the format of the presentation, including specific instructions for a demonstration or other presentation details. Quoters will be notified in writing of the date and time for their specific demonstration. The demonstrations will be held online. The demonstration is limited to 75 minutes in duration. Any remarks made by the Contracting Officer prior to the demonstration will not count against the Quoter's time limit of 75 minutes.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates exchanges with the Quoter after the completion of the demonstration. However, FHFA reserves the right to make award without exchanges. It is anticipated that vendor demonstrations will take place during the period December 7 through December 11. The dates are subject to change at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>Page Limitation. Excluding cover pages, the technical quotation (including all non-price factors) is limited to 25 pages. The page limitation excludes excel spreadsheet attachments and samples of credit research information. The font and format should be of readable quality. Excessively small font may be rejected or not evaluated at the Contracting Officer's discretion.</p>
<p>Quotations shall not include any price information in the technical volume. For the overall technical quotation, a recitation or paraphrasing of the requirements already identified in the work requirements will not improve the quotation.</p>
<p><strong>Volume II- Price Quotationand Business Volume</strong></p>
<p>Factor II - Price Quotation<br />Each Quoter shall submit a price quotation separate from the technical quotation (Volume I). The total evaluated price will be evaluated on the basis of competition. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise those options.</p>
<p>The price quotation shall include the following: Completion of all prices as stated in Attachment A, including any stated options.</p>
<p>Page Limitation. There is no page limitation on the price quote submission.</p>
<p>Quoters shall submit representations and certifications per FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the quoter shall complete electronically)</p>
<p>Quoters Subscription Agreement/Terms and Conditions - A Quoter shall provide a copy of its licensing agreement terms and conditions, preferably a Federal government version, as part of its price and business Volume. <br /><br /><strong>EVALUATION AND SELECTION PROCESS<br /></strong><br />Evaluation and selection are made under FAR Part 13 procedures; therefore, FAR 14 and 15 evaluation and selection procedures are not applicable. The process is purposefully streamlined, and FHFA has broad discretion in the evaluation procedures, by considering positive attributes, negative attributes, and potential risk of the overall quotation.</p>
<p>If FHFA conducts exchanges, exchanges may be with one, several, or all Quoters. Exchanges may vary based on FHFA's need to understand or give the Quoters an opportunity to improve their quotations, but all exchanges will be fair and equitable.</p>
<p>Following an analysis and evaluation, award may be made to one or more than one Quoter that is evaluated to be the best value and determined responsible. While not guaranteed, at the current time, FHFA intends to make two contract awards. FHFA reserves the right to select multiple vendors to provide the same requirements.</p>
<p>FHFA reserves the right to purchase different quantities for the same requirements from different vendors depending upon agency needs.</p>
<p>FHFA reserves the right to award to other than the lowest quoted price. Technical Capability (Volume I) is more important than price (Volume II); however, the degree of importance of price as a factor could become greater when competing Quotations are evaluated as technically equal, when considering all of the Quoters' attributes.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR SUPPORT NOTIFICATION <br />Contractors are advised that employees of the firm identified below may assist the Contracting Officer and evaluators during the acquisition process. These employees will not participate as voting members of any evaluation team (FAR 7.503(c)(12)).

The minimum wage required to be paid to each service employee, laborer, or mechanic performing work on this contract between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, shall be $10.10 per hour.
(b) The Contractor shall adjust the minimum wage paid under this contract each time the Secretary of Labor's annual determination of the applicable minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 results in a higher minimum wage. Adjustments to the Executive Order minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 will be effective for all service employees, laborers, or mechanics subject to the Executive Order beginning January 1 of the following year. The Secretary of Labor will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than 90 days before such new wage is to take effect. The Secretary will also publish the applicable minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor website). The applicable published minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.
(c) The Contracting Officer will adjust the contract price or contract unit price under this clause only for the increase in labor costs resulting from the annual inflation increases in the Executive Order 13658 minimum wage beginning on January 1, 2016.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>I. Description of Requirement</p>
<p>In the interest of decreasing the frequency of death and suffering from prostate cancer, considerable effort has been expended to understand the biological mechanisms responsible for tumorigenesis, disease progression, and resistance to therapy. While the field has advanced substantially with respect to new sequencing and analytical techniques, a limiting factor for the accurate molecular analysis of tumor tissue in prostate cancer is the extent of cellular diversity and heterogeneity in the tissue itself. To solve this problem, the NCI proposes to utilize a technique developed here at the NIH - laser capture microdissection - using the most modern hardware and software platform developed, which has contributed to accelerating the speed of tissue collection and thus decreasing the time associated with the labor the related project. The NCI anticipates using this instrument at least 20 hours per week on a wide range of projects undertaken to further the mission of the NCI.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />&#9633; (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#9633; does &#9633; does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />&#9633; (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

SELECTION CRITERIA: Standard Form 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly-qualified firm based on criterion responses.
 Failure to provide requested data or to comply with the instructions in this notice could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration. The Selection of Architects and Engineers Statute and FAR Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. The AE must demonstrate the teams qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria. Evaluation criteria (1) through (3) are considered the most important and are equal among themselves; criteria (4) and (5) are of slightly less importance and are equal among themselves; criteria (6) and (7) are of slightly less importance still and are equal among themselves; and criteria (8) is of the least importance and will be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal firms.
 Specific evaluation criteria include:
1.	Specialized Experience 
2.	Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence 
3.	Program Management and Capacity 
4.	Past Performance 
5.	Quality Control Program 
6.	Commitment to Small Business 
7.	Firm Location
8.	Volume of Work 

Criterion 1 Specialized Experience (SF330, Part I, Section F): 
Firms will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence in performance of services similar to those anticipated under this contract through evaluation of experience in: 
1.	Global or Multi-Regional Planning (such as GSIPs, Integrated Products Support Plans, and Functional Plans),
o	Global or Multi-Regional planning is defined as infrastructure planning that is strategic in nature, crosses regions and performs analysis that provides actionable recommendations, develops courses of action, or prioritizes identified infrastructure capability gaps, that influence decision making across multiple regions.
   Repetitious planning actions, such as Basic Facility Requirements or Asset evaluations, performed in two or more regions under a single task order in which each planning action is separate, and only affects the individual installation or region where the planning action is proposed, will not qualify as global and multi-regional planning.
2.	Regional Planning (such as Regional Integration Plans, ( RIPs))
o	Regional Planning is defined as infrastructure planning that is strategic in nature, crosses installations within a single region and performs analysis that leads to actionable recommendations, develops courses of action, or prioritizes identified infrastructure capability gaps that influence decision making across multiple installations across a single region.
  Repetitious planning actions, such as Basic Facility Requirements or Asset evaluations, performed at two or more installations under a single task order in which each planning action is separate, and only affects the individual installation where the planning action is proposed, will not qualify as regional planning. 
3.	Installation Planning (such as IDPs, Encroachment Action Plans, Traffic/Parking Movement Studies, and Siting/Land Use Studies),
4.	Business Case Analysis Studies, 
5.	1391 Project Planning Documentation, 
6.	Shore Facility Planning System (Asset Evaluations/Basic Facility Requirements/Facility Planning Documents), and,
Firms may be considered more favorably by demonstrating the following: 
1.
 Specialized experience within the primary geographic area of this contract, the United States West Coast, Mid-West States and Alaska (the geographic areas within the AORs of Navy Regions Southwest and Northwest) and may be evaluated more favorably commensurate with the extent of their experience in the various locations covered in the primary geographic area.
Submission requirements: Provide a maximum of 8 projects completed within the 5 years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this notice that best demonstrate specialized experience of the proposed team in the areas outlined above. Sufficient information to determine the date of completion of the project must be included in the project description or the project will not be considered.
 If more than the maximum number of projects are submitted, the Government will only evaluate the first 8 projects listed and will not evaluate projects beyond the maximum number specified in the submission requirements.
All projects provided in the SF330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract. Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from consideration in the evaluation. To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part 1, Section F, block 25, Firm Name. Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.
 Include an e-mail address and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c). In block 24, include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, and a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above. If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work that firm provided towards the performance of the overall project. If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the firm/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.
 Likewise, if the firm/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the firm/team member proposed for this contract and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.
NOTE: If the firm is a joint venture, projects performed by the joint venture should be submitted; however, if there are no projects performed by the joint venture, a project must be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of 8 projects.
 Firms failing to provide at least one project from each joint venture partner will be considered to have not met the requirements of the criterion. 
Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330 at Part I, Section F and shall be completed projects. Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration. For submittal purposes, a single task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award. Do not submit an IDIQ contract as an example project. Instead, list relevant task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.
 
Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being excluded from evaluation or considered less qualified.
All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in the SF330, Part I, Section F of the. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluation of Criterion 1.

 Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise. Failure to provide a balanced workforce in the disciplines required to satisfy the requirements of the scope listed above will result in the firm being considered not qualified. Specific disciplines that must be included in key personnel are quality control; task order managers, project managers; interdisciplinary facility planners; engineers; program managers; cost estimators; and economist. Professional qualifications and competence will be evaluated on the following:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

C.6 VAAR 852.211-73 BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)

  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

<p align="left">how it was determined that the work performed previously was the same or</p>
<p align="left">similar in nature, size, and complexity to the work specified by this</p>
<p align="left">solicitation. In the event an Offeror is not able to provide at least three (3)</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performances within the last three (3) years, then the Contracting</p>
<p align="left">Officer shall use an integrated assessment to evaluate past performance. If it</p>
<p align="left">is discovered by the Contracting Officer that an offeror failed to disclose a</p>
<p align="left">relevant contract, the contracting officer may find the offeror nonresponsive.</p>
<p align="left">In your selection of recent and relevant projects/programs, consider the</p>
<p align="left">following:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Recency:</p>
<p align="left">relevant past performance within the last three (3) years from the date of</p>
<p align="left">issuance of this solicitation.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Relevancy</p>
<p align="left">extent of similarity between the service/support effort, complexity, dollar</p>
<p align="left">value, contract type, and the Offeror's role as a subcontractor and/or teaming</p>
<p align="left">partner or other comparable attributes of past performance examples and the</p>
<p align="left">source selection requirements; and a measure of the likelihood that the past</p>
<p align="left">performance is an indicator of future performance.</p>
<p align="left">b. In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the</p>
<p align="left">right to use both the information provided in the Offeror's Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past</p>
<p align="left">Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Contract</p>
<p align="left">Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Defense Contract</p>
<p align="left">Management Agency (DCMA) or similar systems, and commercial sources.</p>
<p align="left">Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by</p>
<p align="left">Offerors in their proposals may be used by the Government to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">Offeror past performance. However, the burden of providing thorough,</p>
<p align="left">complete, and current past performance information as requested in this</p>
<p align="left">paragraph remains with the Offerors. Proposals that do not contain the</p>
<p align="left">information requested, risk rejection.</p>
<p align="left">c. The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's</p>
<p align="left">probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The past performance</p>
<p align="left">evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of</p>
<p align="left">performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's</p>
<p align="left">requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for</p>
<p align="left">each offeror after evaluating the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on</p>
<p align="left">performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">will be evaluated using the following ratings:</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Table 1. Performance Confidence Assessments</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Rating Description</p>
<p align="left">Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a high expectation that</p>
<p align="left">the offeror will successfully perform the required</p>
<p align="left">effort</p>
<p align="left">Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a reasonable</p>
<p align="left">expectation that the offeror will successfully</p>
<p align="left">perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has a low expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p align="left">No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance</p>
<p align="left">record, the Government has no expectation that the</p>
<p align="left">offeror will be able to successfully perform the</p>
<p align="left">required effort</p>
<p align="left">Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or</p>
<p align="left">the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no</p>
<p align="left">meaningful confidence assessment rating can be</p>
<p align="left">reasonably assigned</p>
<p align="left">All recent and relevant past performance comments received will be taken into account</p>
<p align="left">and could affect the overall rating. The overall past performance evaluation is a</p>
<p align="left">subjective decision based on the whole of all data received. In the case of an Offeror</p>
<p align="left">without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past</p>
<p align="left">performance is not available, or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can</p>
<p align="left">be reasonably assigned; the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on</p>
<p align="left">past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be</p>
<p align="left">determined to have unknown past performance and be deemed "neutral."</p>
<p align="left">d. Submission Requirements. The offeror shall submit a Past Performance</p>
<p align="left">Volume containing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Authorization Letters for each identified effort for a commercial</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">customer authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the</p>
<p align="left">Offeror's performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet - <strong>(see attachment 6). </strong>The Offeror</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">shall provide documentation outlining the Offeror's past performance with</p>
<p align="left">contracts, as prime, subcontractor, teaming partner, and /or joint venture partner,</p>
<p align="left">which is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being</p>
<p align="left">procured under this solicitation. The submittal shall include rationale supporting</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's assertion of relevance and how it was determined that the work</p>
<p align="left">performed previously was the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to</p>
<p align="left">the work specified by this solicitation. Offerors are required to explain what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what</p>
<p align="left">aspects of the proposed effort they relate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Past Performance Questionnaire - <strong>(see attachment 3). </strong>For the contracts</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">identified on each Relevant Contracts Reference Sheet, the Offeror shall forward</p>
<p align="left">a copy of the past performance questionnaire to the points of contact responsible</p>
<p align="left">for monitoring performance under such contracts. The points of contact shall</p>
<p align="left">return the questionnaires via email <em>directly </em>to the Contract Specialist (Mr. John</p>
<p align="left">Porter) not later than the solicitation due date. Any questionnaires not returned</p>
<p align="left">directly to the Government point of contact (Mr. John Porter) will not be reviewed</p>
<p align="left">and evaluated. It is the Offerors responsibility to ensure questionnaires are</p>
<p align="left">provided to the Government point of contract (Mr. John Porter) on or before the</p>
<p align="left">due date. The information contained in the questionnaires will be used to evaluate</p>
<p align="left">the Offeror's past performance.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">Volume III</p>
<p align="left">Cost/Price will be evaluated for reasonableness, balance and completeness. Since this is</p>
<p align="left">a Firm Fixed Price contract, the Government will not evaluate supporting cost data unless</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200039 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-84 effective 1 November 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200039, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-16-Q-200039, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. <br />Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 24 November 2015 at 4:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 25 November 2015. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to dawn.b.oconnor@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-16-Q-200039 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200038 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-84 effective 1 November 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>See attached documents titled: <br />1) Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200038, for a list of required parts.<br />2) Terms and Conditions - HSCG38-16-Q-200038, for applicable clauses, instructions, and evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. <br />Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 24 November 2015 at 4:15 pm EST. Anticipated award date is on or about 25 November 2015. E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to dawn.b.oconnor@uscg.mil. Please indicate HSCG38-16-Q-200038 in subject line. Quotations may also be mailed to the following address:</p>
<p>USCG ALC<br />1664 Weeksville Road<br />SRR Hangar 75, HSCG38-16-Q-200038<br />Attn: Dawn O'Connor<br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

INTRODUCTION/PURPOSES

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Cable Loop (ACL) program is responsible for the sustainment of current telecommunication infrastructure and replacement of obsolete telecommunication infrastructure at airports throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). Fiber optic equipment and cabling is used to interface voice and data connections between various on-airport facilities. Based on new requirements made available as part of this request  see updated Product Description (PD) in Attachment 7   the FAAs purpose of this Market Survey and Request for Information (RFI)/Draft Screening Information Request (SIR) is to:

(1)	Conduct a Market Survey by obtaining answers to several questions regarding commercially available Multi-Service Platform (MSP) equipment. The FAA intends to use this Market Survey to refine the MSP acquisition and deployment planning. 

(2)	Collect feedback on Draft SIR Sections in preparation for a potential competitive procurement. The feedback is intended to improve the solicitation request, minimize confusion, and mitigate risks related to Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment and sources.

The FAA welcomes responses from all vendors. Due to the benefits to the FAA of a vendors having quality control and configuration management over all aspects of the contract, including the production process, the agency is currently considering limiting the competition to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)i.e. vendors that design, manufacture, and sell their own productsof the required equipment. This limitation would not preclude OEMs from partnering with small or large distributors or integrators as long as the OEM is the prime contractor.

This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management Policy 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis (April 2013) and 3.2.1.3.11.1 General (January 2010).

ONRR is transforming its framework for geospatial information and migrating from exclusively reacting to discrete product requirement-submissions to using methodologies that deliver content through user interaction with a web-based service. ONRR is pursuing applications, services, and technological ideas to expand its Geographic Information Systems GIS services to the ONRR community. ONRR seeks to make geospatial data, tools, technology, and services more accessible, discoverable, sharable, reusable, and reliable to the ONRR community which includes State, local, and tribal governments.&nbsp;<br /><br />ONRR currently performs analyses and delivers GIS products on an as-needed basis. A team of GIS analysts reviews requests, performs analyses, and creates products in response to the request. ONRR does not have a user interface that allows individual users to view the data, perform analysis, or create cartographic products or reports. ONRR uses the Department of Interior (DOI) standard GIS software provided by ESRI. Internal GIS developers use ESRI products to create, update, and maintain data and products with data stored primarily in the file geodatabase format. Several file geodatabases are comprised of a variety of data assembled from several sources internal and external in ESRI formats or derived from ESRI formats.</span></p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to develop an enterprise-level GIS with the characteristics listed below.<br /><br />1. Multiple users: ONRR has approximately 600 users. Of those users about 10 percent will be accessing the system simultaneously. Users have role-level definitions. We require the ability to scale to external users.<br />2. Multiple physical locations: Users will access the system from several geographic locations with users in both ONRR facilities and non-ONRR facilities. Access to the system is through direct desktop connections, virtual private networks, and Citrix.<br />3. Web-based: This will be a web-based system.<br />4. User role-based access: ONRR users can access the GIS based on roles to create, view, and analyze data, and produce products such as maps, charts, and graphs.<br />5. Centralized data: The data are centralized in a relational database management system such as Oracle or SQL Server.<br />6. Multiple data sources: The system will incorporate data acquired from several organizations including Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), United States Geological Survey (USGS), and private industry.<br />7. Data integration: Data integrated into the system are stored in multiple formats including ESRI, Oracle, SQL Server, MS Access, and MS Excel.<br />8. Internal developers: ONRR GIS developers can manage data and objects, perform analyses, produce products, and build web applications, queries and scripts. <br />9.

Vendor Questions - 11/20/2015

Q - Is this strictly telephone call for consult or will the physician be carrying a beeper? 

A -  As stated  in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) paragraph 3.2.4.1:

3.2.4.1.	Contractor shall provide consultative services to VA physicians 24 hours per day, seven days a week.    The contractor must be able to respond by response of telephone to emergencies within 20 minutes of being called or paged.

Q -  If this is not shared call, are they expected to take call every night and every weekend of the period of performance?  

A - See answer above.

Q - If it is beeper call, how do we bill for these services?

A - As stated in the Schedule of Services, "(On-Call Services - after-hours telephonic consultation all-inclusive)."

Q - For inpatient, the answers to questions state 1-2 inpatients per day and outpatient is flexible.  Can we get an approximate number for outpatient?  Or even a range (i.e. 15-18 patients per day, etc.)?

A - Roughly 6 patients per day so about 30 per week.  Currently clinic is only  day and the other  is spent reading studies and seeing inpatients.

<ARCHDATE>12202016
<DESC>The General Services Administration has a continued urgent need for the continuation of E-Gov Travel-1 Services to those remaining customer agencies that are currently in varying phases of ETS 2.0 adoption and implementation which has been justified under FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source. As a result, it is anticipated that the agencies listed below will need varying lengths of extended ETS1 coverage under GS-33F-N0017 which includes ETS1 shut down and data delivery.  The agencies identified for coverage under this extension are the Department of Labor, the Department of State, USAID, Federal Communications Commission and the US Department of Justice. No agency will need services beyond six months.  The E-Gov Travel Service 1 (ETS1) program provides mandatory travel services under the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) E-Gov Act of 2002, Pub. L No. 107-347, for up to seventy-one (71) Chief Financial Officer and Federal Financial Reform Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies, Non-CFO agencies and several other Government Commissions and Corporations.  The ETS1 travel service is an essential service.  The services delivered by ETS1 include secure web based fully integrated end-to-end processes for Travel Authorization, Travel Reservation (air, hotel, and car), and Travel Vouchering (local and temporary duty) and reporting.  These essential services have been tailored and integrated into specific agency business systems (Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Financial) to meet specific agency requirements. ETS1 has replaced paper-based solutions.
