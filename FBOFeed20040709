<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to Acres International, Ltd. (AIL) a requirement for additional State-of-the-art evaluations for Seminoe Dam.  The seismic structural analysis study is required to evaluate the performance of the dam, in its current and estimated condition, under seismic loading. Reclamation has identified AIL as the only source both economically and technically capable of performing the required evaluations, based on their use of a proprietary structural program to perform the static stress analysis for concrete growth.  This very unique static state of stress must be the initial condition at the start of the dynamic analysis.  Only AIL with their proprietary program has this initial state of stress and can perform the subsequent dynamic analysis. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide a similar required service must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, Attention: John Collins.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541330 which is $4 Million.  This notice may represent the only official notice of solicitation.

This publication serves as a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Simrad U.S.A to provide EK60 Echosounders.  The echosounders must provide quantitative information about the acoustical backscatter from fish and zooplankton in the water column, backscatter from the seafloor, and high-resolution bathymetry.  The National Marine Fisheries Service needs these data to concurrently, and thus efficiently, survey fish and zooplankton dispersion and abundance, habitat type, and bathymetric relief.  Four frequencies (38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz) are used for acoustical species identification and target strength estimation.  Simrad is the only known manufacturer of a split-beam scientific echosounder system that provides a simultaneous 1kW transmission at four frequencies, and a stable 140 dB re 1W receiver dynamic range, quadrature sampling, and both system control and data output via Ethernet.  These features are required for compatibility with existing survey hardware and for data comparability with historical surveys conducted by the U.S. AMLR Program and other NMFS laboratories.  Delivery date will be no more than 30 days from date of contract award.  To the best of the Government=s knowledge and capability, there are no other companies that exist in the U.S. who can meet all needed requirements.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511.  Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement in writing to Kristina Loesell, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, or via email at Kristina.M.Loesell@noaa.gov This notice may represent the only official notice of the intended contract award.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sea Technology Services to provide meteorological and oceanographic data, which will be used to describe frontal zones, water mass structure and surface currents in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. In addition STS will provide support and the specialized skills and services for shipboard maintenance, operation, and repair of instruments for measuring seawater properties, meteorological conditions, and multi-frequency acoustic backscatter.  Expertise is also required for collecting, processing, interpreting, archiving, and documenting the oceanographical and meteorological data, and calibrating, monitoring, and maintaining the performance of a multi-frequency scientific echosounder system.   The information will in turn be used to study the physical causes of variations in biological production in the area.   

Objectives of this contract will include:  the collection and archival of data while underway and while at station, and the preparation of a report summarizing the activities and the data collected. In 2005, the contractor is needed to assist with installing, testing, characterizing, and maintaining a new multi-frequency echosounder system, and to quantitatively compare the new system with the old.  Sea Technology Services (STS) has previously designed and constructed a transducer multiplexer, and supplied it to the government, expressly for this purpose.  STS has extensive experience with the old and the new echosounder systems, their calibrations, performance characterizations, and maintenance.  In support of AMLR 2005, 2006, and 2007, and possibly 2008 and 2009, STS is needed to setup, deploy, maintain, recover, and pack six instrumented oceanographic buoys off the coast of Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island.  STS has designed and constructed the buoys to be deployed, and has supplied them to the government for this purpose. 

The government intends to award a firm fixed price contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the existing agency requirements. The sole source nature of this solicitation is necessary on the part of the government to maintain consistent data collection efforts with prior year’s studies. The studies performed by this contractor have ultimately led to the formulation of management advice and options in support of the U.S. obligations to the Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).  The Contractor will be required to meet the ship in Punta Arenas, Chile at the beginning of January 2005 and will be underway in the Antarctic region until the middle of March 2005.     

This is not a request for competitive proposals however any interested concern, which believes it can satisfy this requirement may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement in writing to Contract Specialist Stephanie Kyles, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, or by email at Stephanie.m.kyles@noaa.gov no later than August 23, 2004.  If as a result of this notice, another firm demonstrates the ability to provide the required components, within the required time frame, the sole source nature of this requirement will be reevaluated.

B. Full text of announcement

The Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for Situation-Aware Protocols In Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT), a new program to develop software coordination managers that provide coordination support to fielded human units, e.g., tactical teams. In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the SAPIENT Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm for further information. The SAPIENT PIP contains additional details on the program objectives, application space, program description, evaluation plans and metrics, program scope, general information, submission process, reporting requirements and procedures, proposal format, evaluation and funding processes, and administrative addresses. Additionally, all information MUST be handled in accordance with the SAPIENT Security Classification Guide (SCG), which is available to eligible contractors. Refer herein to paragraph IV. 2. c. or the SAPIENT PIP for instructions on how to obtain a copy of the SAPIENT SCG.

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 
PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA.
Network-centric operations use applications which enhance the ability to rapidly orient, observe, decide and act. The challenges of an increasing number of networked applications and the complexity of the networks which interconnect them have been met in part by the internetworking protocol architecture (IP) and its transmission control protocol (TCP). A series of incremental optimizations of the TCP transport protocol for the commonly encountered cases of delay, throughput, congestion and link errors for research and commercial environments has led to a protocol which is often ill-suited to the challenges encountered in military operations. 

 The Situation-Aware Protocols In Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT) program seeks to address these deficiencies with a new generation of cognitive protocol architectures. The overarching goals of the SAPIENT program are to use these cognitive attributes to dramatically reduce the effect of network impairments on applications and to show a positive trend in this capability over time, as new situations are encountered and learned. Desired capabilities include interoperable knowledge representations and rapid incorporation of new knowledge about applications, network conditions, and building blocks from which new protocols can be constructed.

The approach of this program is to combine cognitive techniques (such as goal-based planning, knowledge representation and machine learning) with architectures for flexible protocol configuration (such as reconfigurable network stacks, protocol boosters, micro-protocol architectures and other extensible network architectures).  The central goal of this program is to create a new generation of adaptive systems which achieve new levels of functionality through “situation-awareness.” 

It is the hypothesis of the SAPIENT effort that more specific knowledge of application requirements and network conditions would allow a more appropriate protocol to be deployed. At the same time, the wide range of application requirements and network conditions would create an explosion in the number of protocols required for coupling each application appropriately to the many network conditions which can exist. 

The cognitive technologies we seek will permit situation knowledge to be inserted by operators, exchanged amongst systems and learned in new situations by operating dynamically composed protocols in reaction to network conditions as they are actually encountered. 

There are three major research thrusts in Phase I of the program. These areas are:
•	Knowledge Representation
•	Selection and Composition
•	Learning

The knowledge representation effort will determine representations of knowledge appropriate for describing situations encountered in operational networks and in enabling machine response to these situations, including automated learning of effective responses. The selection and composition effort will be focused on exploiting the knowledge of the situation to construct a functioning network protocol adapted to the situation. It is expected, although not required, that a form of symbolic reasoning such as a planning system will be used to address the selection and composition process. The learning effort is focused on automatic enhancement of the knowledge base through recording of situation/response/result information that can be used towards a self-improving adapted system. Successful proposals will address all of these issues. In some cases this may require team efforts involving multiple institutions, including universities. Where necessary, such teaming is strongly encouraged.

Assessment and validation of situation-aware protocols will be carried out to determine their efficacy in conditions experienced at the edge of DoD networks, which as noted previously are characterized by challenging link conditions such as mobility, ad-hoc routing, long round-trip times between end-points, extreme error conditions and link blockage. Among the scientific contributions of this program will be the creation of a practical framework in which the effect of protocol choices upon applications in impaired networks can be quantified.

The first phase of this effort is planned to be 18 months long. If the research effort is progressing successfully, two additional phases, of 18 months and 12 months respectively, are anticipated. 

Phase I program goals are to demonstrate that situation awareness benefits networked applications which today, using conventional protocol architectures such as TCP, are severely affected by network impairments. 

A testbed designed and operated by an Independent Test and Evaluation (ITE) entity will measure performer systems using real applications operating with realistic link conditions. The target measure of success at the end of Phase I of the SAPIENT program will be that the application impairment (reduction in throughput, increase in latency, or unavailability) is no more than five (5) times worse than the analogous impairment of the network. This ratio must be achieved within one hundred and twenty (120) seconds from the time the network impairment is first encountered, and it is expected that the system will continue its self-improvement as time progresses.

Phase II program goals are to demonstrate that the benefit of situation awareness extends to a number of important operating environments, including mobile satellite communications as well as the applications used in Phase I. The testbed operated by the ITE entity will be extended with both a satellite-on-the-move (SOTM) capability, and with additional applications. The “best of breed” of the systems in Phase I of the program will be extended to these new environments, while reducing the multiplicative effect of network impairments on applications to a factor of three (3). For Phase II, the desired improvement must occur within a limited time interval of two (2) seconds. Note that this latter goal for learning performance is a factor of 60 improvement over the Phase I capability; it is expected that a major goal of Phase II will be successful systems integration and refinement towards DARPA’s desired capabilities for SAPIENT (including the ability to operate with a broader range of networks and applications),  as well as accelerated learning technologies resulting from their specialization to the situation-aware protocol selection and composition task.

The ultimate goal at the end of  Phase III is that the effect of network impairments on applications is multiplied by no more than two (2) times the effect of the basic network impairment (e.g., link blockage, error bursts/congestion loss, or delay). The “final exam” for SAPIENT will be a structured traversal of a real or emulated urban environment in which networked applications are used by competing teams to locate pre-placed “flags.” The structure will presume that the SAPIENT program goal of limiting the effects of network impairments on applications to a factor of two (2) has been achieved and will be timed accordingly. It will also be presumed that learning will occur within 200 milliseconds. Notably, traversal of an urban environment is characterized by mobility and challenging wireless conditions, including blockage of satellite, mobile and airborne communications capabilities.

Proposals should be for a base period of 18 months (Phase I), and are encouraged to provide for optional efforts to pursue efforts in Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (12 months). 

Offerors must explicitly state in their proposals a plan for providing deliverables for installation, training, manuals, etc. required for evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Team’s testbed facility, as well as travel costs and costs for collaborating with the ITE entity. Offerors should support the technical feasibility of their approach and discuss the future development of their approaches, validation and technology transition strategies.

TEST AND EVALUATION. Performers will test and evaluate their technologies using a testbed developed for this program and operated by an Independent Evaluation Team, and results will be reported at periodic program review meetings with performers and at PI meetings, which will be held at program kickoff and at least once annually thereafter. To enable this testing and evaluation, performers will provide software distributions and will document all test and evaluation choices and procedures (hardware, software environment, scenario, etc.) with sufficient clarity for a third party to replicate the evaluations. 

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants

<DESC>LARGE APERTURE SPACE SURVEILLANCE (OPTICAL) (LASSO) PHASE I, BAA04-36

The Tactical Technology Office (TTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting proposals for the initial study phase (phase 1) of the four phase DARPA LASSO program.  Phase I is conceptual system design and technology search; Phase II is the formulation of a preferred system design; Phase III is the detail design and Phase IV is the fabrication and demonstration.  The LASSO program is pursuing the near term (4-5 year) demonstration of an in-space manufacturing concept focusing on emerging programs and initiatives within DARPA, NASA, NRO and other DoD Agencies.  

This effort will include design trade studies, conceptual system design and manufacturing approaches, and technology research.  Future phases will include preliminary and detailed design, small scale risk reduction activities, and large scale system fabrication and demonstration.
 
OVERALL PROGRAM GOAL AND VISION

The overall goal of the LASSO program is to examine and validate technical options for manufacturing large space optical structures outside the confines of the Earth’s gravity.  The system envisioned is a 150 meter optical system in geosynchronous orbit with the capability of 24/7 persistence and 6-inch resolution.  Manufacturing in the space environment will enable novel structures that could not survive the loads experienced during terrestrial launch as well as the production of extremely large structures that enables optical systems resolution and accuracy that are not otherwise conceivable.  Such structures are important to address both National security and energy issues.  The size of such structures is currently limited by volume and mass constraints of launch vehicles.   Technical challenges for the LASSO program include resource utilization, robotic processing, enabling structures and materials, propellants, power generation and manufacturing processes that can take advantage of the space environment, such as vacuum deposition, extrusion, nanotube fabrication, and surface finishing.   Mass and complexity minimization of key components will drive the design of the system.

This program will identify key technical challenges and define a demonstration mission to resolve critical issues for space manufacture.  The demonstrations proposed will show scalability, traceability and heritage toward a full scale operational system.  Miniaturized robotics capable of remotely processing materials and building rudimentary structures will be designed, fabricated and tested.  Surface finishing techniques to meet optical wavelength tolerances will be a major focus of the program.  Utility assessments of space manufacture in conjunction with operational customers will be performed to plan for technology transition.  The LASSO program will lay the foundation and provide capability to increase the use of space.



PHASE I DESCRIPTION
 
Phase I is a six-month effort to explore advanced and innovative technologies to generate a feasible conceptual method to fabricate a large, 150 meter optical aperture in space that will contribute toward the development and design of a 6 inch resolution capable sensor system operating from both low earth and geostationary orbits.  Conceptual designs and manufacturing approaches will be substantiated, experimental results or calculations proving feasibility of technical approach and its scalability will be provided.  The effort will also include trade studies to explore the cost effectiveness of LASSO as compared to equivalent orbit constellations of  LEO or GEO satellites having the same 6-inch resolution and 24/7 persistence capability.  At a minimum, Phase I products will include: a conceptual design and manufacturing approach of a system capable of meeting the above objectives; identification of feasible advanced and innovative technologies to execute the demonstration; rationale for why this design and manufacturing approach are affordable, feasible and effective; and a program execution plan including risk mitigation steps, traceability relationships for scaled demonstrations, total program schedule and funding requirements.  The contractor will support and provide a kick off meeting at award, an interim meeting and final brief at DARPA in Arlington, VA at approximately the 3rd and 6th month from award, respectively.  

FUNDING
 
Total funding per Phase I award under this BAA is $500K for a six month effort.  The government anticipates awarding multiple Phase I contracts and expects the offeror to provide a realistic proposal for best achieving the program objectives within the outlined budget and schedule.  The government reserves the right to award without discussions.


INFORMATION

All awards will be subject to availability of government funds.  Awards will be made to those offerors whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and join other in submitting proposals.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. Offerors are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. 

DARPA/TTO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the bidder believes the work, if successful, would merit classification.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you chose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. The point of contact for classified responses is Paul Mclean, DARPA/SID, and can be reached at 703-526-6708.  Bidders who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response.


AWARD INSTRUMENT AND EVALUATION APPROACH 

Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work propose.

<DESC>Modification to Synopsis for Substations.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract for 4 each substations, skid mount, right hand design; 4 each substations, skid mount, left hand design; 2 each switchgears, 5-way (3-load interrupting and 2-fault interrupting ways); 2 each switchgears, 4-way (2-load interrupting and 2-fault interrupting ways); 2 each pad mounted transformers; and 4 each industrial power stations.  A priced option will be included for up to 4 each additional substations with pricing good for one year from time of award.  Right or left hand configuration will be determined at the time of each exercised option.  Delivery will be FOB Destination to Norfolk, VA. A complete RFP package will be available on or about 9 July 2004 by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows:  http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The applicable NAICS Code is 335313.  The size standard is no more than 750 employees.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments will ONLY be available for download at the above sites; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations.  By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award.  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.     

After receipt of proposals and completion of technical and past performance evaluations, the Government may conduct a competitive, anonymous, on-line reverse auction Dynamic Pricing Event (DPE) as described in the solicitation.  Offerors whose Volume I Technical Proposals have received a “Pass” rating and Volume II Past Performance receives at least a “marginal” rating may be invited to participate in the reverse auction.  Submission of a proposal in response to the solicitation will be considered as consent that the offeror will participate in the auction and that the offeror’s prices can be revealed during the reverse auction (however the offeror itself will remain anonymous).  

Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal’s price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offerors are determined to have submitted equal or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall receive the award.  The Government reserves the right to select other than the lowest-priced offeror or to select the offeror with a higher or highest past performance rating if it is determined to be of best value to the Government.  Irrespective of the rating, if the price impact assessment concludes that award to the higher-priced, past performance superior proposal is not in the best interest of the Government, the Contracting Officer may reserve the right to award to the past performance inferior, lower-priced offeror.  The Government will evaluate options for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The option for up to four (4) each additional substations may be exercised within one (1) year of contract award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES  PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-04-00334.  It is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990, with a small business size standard of $6 million.  The  Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement for updated chemical mechanisms to ensure that the predictions of ozone and aerosol concentrations from Air Quality Models are accurate and scientifically justified.  It is anticipated that a firm, fixed-price purchase order will be awarded under  Full and Open Competition, with a requirement to modify/update the Carbon Bond 4 chemical mechanism (Gery et. al., 1989), and provide two versions of the mechanism--one that has the number of species comparable to earlier versions, and one that has additional, explicit chemical species.  Both  versions of the updated mechanism must be evaluated against a comprehensive suite of smog chamber data, and provided along with the testing information to assist EPA in implementing this mechanism in a 3-D model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system (details at  http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/models3/overview.html).  Both mechanisms shall be public domain, available for use by EPA and the scientific community. Task 1: Make modifications to update the mechanism and account for additional species in the mechanism - Under this task, the mechanism will be updated  as appropriate to be consistent with the most recent chemical kinetics information available.  Two versions of the mechanism shall be developed.  The first one shall have a comparable number of species as earlier versions, to retain the computational efficiency of earlier versions.  The mechanism  shall also include semi-volatile products that result from the atmospheric reactions of alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics and are precursors to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA).  An additional version of the mechanism will be developed which is similar to the first version, but   includes the addition of  several explicit species, including the following: formaldehyde; acetaldehyde; internal olefins; terminal olefins; acrolein; 1,3-butadiene; methanol; ethanol; toluene; xylene;  -terpene;  -terpene; and, chlorine (including chlorine reactions with VOCs).  To accommodate the  new species included above and to improve the representation of atmospheric chemical reactions, revisions to existing mechanism species shall also be made as needed.  For example, a new species representing aldehydes with 3 or more carbon atoms will be needed to replace the current higher aldehyde  species that includes acetaldehyde and higher aldehydes.  Task 2: Format the mechanisms for input to CMAQ, provide additional input files needed to implement the mechanisms, and provide box model simulations for verification and testing of the CMAQ implementation -  The mechanisms developed in Task  1 shall be delivered to EPA in a format suitable for input to the EPA CMAQ model.  In addition to the mechanisms, the contractor shall deliver a package of   at least three box-model scenarios where the mechanisms have been deployed and run in a box model.  The selection of conditions for these  scenarios shall include variations in pressure and temperature, that can be used to verify correct implementation of these dependencies in CMAQ.   (For example,1 run @ P=1 atm T=298K, 1 run @ P=0.5 atm T=298K & 1 run at P=1atm & T=310). The package of box model runs shall include  all model inputs  and outputs so that results from the final CMAQ implementation of the mechanisms  can be benchmarked against results obtained from the original formulations. In addition, the assignments of emission compounds to the Carbon Bond 4 mechanism species shall be updated for each version of the mechanism.   Further, any changes to the emission processing algorithms needed to accommodate the new mechanisms shall be thoroughly documented.  Task 3: Evaluate the modified mechanism against a comprehensive suite of smog chamber data - The mechanisms developed under Task 1 shall be evaluated against a large  number of smog chamber runs to ensure that the predictions are consistent with experimental observations.  This smog chamber data will include both archived and recent measurements from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and the University of California, Riverside.  The contractor shall  develop a justifiable wall mechanism for use with the experimental data and describe the theory behind it.  The contractor shall provide plots, tables, and statistics to demonstrate that the mechanism predictions are in reasonable agreement with the data.  These evaluations shall also include  comparisons with the existing CMAQ version of the Carbon Bond 4 mechanism to identify potential effects of the mechanism changes on model predictions.  Any modifications to the mechanisms that result from insights gained during the evaluation phase shall be delivered to EPA as the task progresses.   The contractor shall present results of this evaluation to EPA scientists in Research Triangle Park, NC.  Project quality objectives of the mechanism evaluation, techniques used, quality control measures, peer reviews/audits of the results and validation of the mechanism shall be documented in a QA  Project Plan, to be submitted as a deliverable to EPA under this task.   Task 4:  Document the modifications and evaluations - All modifications made to the mechanisms, the evaluation of the modified mechanisms, and the results of the predictions from the modified mechanisms shall be documented.  A  summary of the modifications and results shall be reported in a report with the format and size suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed international journal.  Additional details shall be provided in a series of appendices to the summary.  A draft version of this report shall be provided to the  Project Officer prior to being finalized.  After receiving comments on the draft report, the contractor shall address the comments in the final version of the report and submit the final report to EPA. The Project Officer will provide feedback on the draft of the final report from Task 4 no later  than two weeks after receiving the report, allowing the contractor sufficient time to incorporate all comments into the final version of the report.   Project officer for this action is Deborah Leucken at (919) 541-0244.  [END OF TASKS.]  NOTE:  A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) shall be  submitted as a deliverable for Task 3.  Full documentation of the work done during this contract shall be provided as part of Task 4.  Task 2, including delivery of the mechanism in a version suitable for inclusion in CMAQ shall be completed by September 30, 2004.  Task 3, including a short draft  report documenting the information collected under this task, shall be completed by November 30, 2004.  All work on this contract shall be completed by March 30, 2005.   All deliverables should be sent to the project officer at the following address:  Deborah Luecken, U. S.

<SUBJECT>R -- To provide critical technical and statistical support for the development of the Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review (MCR).
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0000HCS4-2004-09755
<RESPDATE>061604
<CONTACT>Patricia Rose, Procurement Technician, Phone (513)533-8256, Fax (513)533-8283, Email par2@cdc.gov - Dwight Favors, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone (513)533-8137, Fax (513)533-8283, Email dyf3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Office of Analysis and Epidemiology (OAE), Health Promotion Statistics Branch (HPSB), plans to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with Maryanne Freedman, for a professional services contract to provide critical technical and statistical support for the development of the Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review (MCR). HPSB provides statistical and technical support to the Office for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS. ODPHP is the HHS office responsible for coordinating Healthy People 2010 and is leading the MCR activity. 

Healthy People 2010 contains 467 objectives organized into 28 Focus Areas. The data for tracking the objectives come from 190 data sources; it is HPSB's responsibility to gather, interpret, disseminate and communicate the data. As the decade reaches the mid-point and Healthy People 2010 reaches the midcourse, there are several thousand data points to be reviewed and analyzed. The Midcourse Review (MCR) is an opportunity to verify that the objectives can be tracked, examine the trends for each objective, and assess the progress of the Healthy People 2010 objectives. The substantial breadth and depth of these tasks will require considerable technical and editorial expertise. 
The services requested will allow HPSB to create the drafts of the data-intensive portions of the MCR while the staff is still fully occupied with other vital Healthy People 2010 assignments, including briefings of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the NCHS Director, Progress Review production, and gathering data before the 12/31/04 MCR data cutoff. In addition, considerable assistance will be required for editing the text portions of the MCR and other data-related functions during the period of the contract. 
OBJECTIVE: The objective is to engage the services of an individual with knowledge of both the conceptual framework of Healthy People 2010 and the technical expertise in health data and the expertise to communicate statistical information to health professionals and the public. The Contractor will complement the analytical and subject expertise of HPSB staff and provide a high-level, overall view of the content as well as statistical and editorial support for the creation of the Healthy People 2010 MCR products. 
 
SCOPE OF WORK: In order to achieve the objective, the following activities will be carried out under the contract: 
Task 1-0 Kick-off meeting 
The Contractor shall meet with the HPSB to confirm the tasks and timeframe for the scope of work. 
Task 2-0 Review, rewrite, and edit Parts A and C of Tracking Healthy People (THP). 
Part A of THP, "General Data Issues," contains detailed information regarding population estimates, missing data, State and local data, and variability. The Contractor will review the 50-page section, ascertain which issues have changed, update and rewrite when necessary, and edit the section. Part C of THP, "Major Data Sources," contains descriptions of 23 data systems; the content and coverage of these sources may have changed over time, thereby affecting the measurement of Healthy People 2010 objectives. The Contractor will review the data source descriptions, update, and rewrite as needed. 
Task 3-0 Edit Part B and the List of Tables and Figures of Tracking Healthy People. 
Part B of Tracking Healthy People, "Operational Definitions," is comprised of 28 chapters organized by Focus Area, and contains details for each objective, including national data source, state data source, measure, baseline, numerator, denominator, and more. During the MCR, many objectives will change; developmental objectives will become measurable, data sources and baselines will change, and objectives will be dropped. The THP chapters will be rewritten by eight different analysts. The Contractor will edit the chapters for technical content and overall clarity. 
Task 4-0 Produce Templates for Progress Quotient and Disparity Measurement charts and tables for each Focus Area. 
The purpose of the MCR is to report progress toward the Healthy People 2010 goals and objectives at the midpoint of the decade. Progress quotient and disparity charts and table templates will be produced for each focus area chapter. The Contractor shall work with HPSB to develop and refine the components of the charts. 
Task 5-0 Produce Progress Quotient and Disparity measurement charts and tables. The Contractor, working with the templates produced in Task 4, shall produce the final progress quotient and disparity measurement charts and tables for each focus area. 
Task 6-0 Design and Produce MCR Appendix contents. 
The Contractor shall design and produce the technical notes and appendices tables that will provide additional information on the measurement of progress and health disparities. 
Task 7-0 Review and Edit MCR publication front materials for goals 1 and 2. The Contractor shall edit the goals section of the MCR text to provide consistency of format and writing style. 
Task 8-0 Edit MCR focus area chapter text. 
The Contractor shall edit the MCR chapter text for each focus area, assuring consistency of format and writing style. This task is crucial in light of the fact that each of the 28 focus areas will have a different author. 
Task 9-0 Review and edit final clearance version of MCR. 
The Contractor shall edit the MCR goals section, chapter text for each focus area, and appendices, ensuring consistency of format and writing style. Significant attention to detail will be needed to ensure consistency throughout the MCR, and the incorporation of public comments. 
Task 10-0 Review and edit final MCR 
The Contractor shall edit all changed portions of the text, ensuring the 
incorporation of the HHS-wide clearance comments while maintaining consistency of format and style. This task is expected to be performed under severe time constraints. 
Task 11-0 Produce Summary Report (i.e., Statistical Note) 
The Contractor will prepare a summary report (i.e., Statistical Note) of the changes accomplished during the MCR, including significant changes to the data definitions, objectives that have been dropped, changed re-worded, and added.

<SUBJECT>R -- EVALUATION OF INFORMAL CHILDCARE PROVIDERS IN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-04Y004923
<RESPDATE>072404
<ARCHDATE>08082004
<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Child Care Bureau  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with The Oklahoma Childcare Resource and Referral Association, Oklahoma City, OK .  

Purpose:
Public Law 104-193 amended the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to reserve “not less than 1 percent and no more than 2 percent of the aggregate Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) funds for Indian Tribes.  The Secretary elected to reserve the full 2 percent set-aside.  In FY 2003, 259 Tribal grantees were awarded $96,066,881 in CCDF funds.  Over 500 Federally recognized Indian Tribes, Alaska Native Villages and a Native Hawaiian organization receive CCDF funds directly or through consortium arrangements.   Indian children are dually eligible to receive services from a Tribal or State CCDF program.  With few exceptions, tribal CCDF grantees are located in rural, economically challenged areas. 

The CCDF regulations provide enormous flexibility for Tribes to design and administer their programs in accordance with the unique needs and challenges in their tribal communities.  Recognizing that many smaller Tribes do not have the infrastructure in place to support certain CCDF requirements, the Child Care Bureau exempted these tribal grantees from two key provisions.  First, smaller Tribes (“exempt Tribes”) are not required to spend at least four percent of their CCDF funds on activities that promote quality child care.  Second, exempt Tribes are not required to offer the full array of child care options to parents by operating a certificate program.  

Historically, Tribal communities have provided child care through an informal network of family, friends and neighbors.  The Cherokee Nation contracts annually with 300 relatives to provide child care.  In FY 2002, 1,088 children were cared for by relatives.  The Cherokee Nation provides an array of support to providers including monitoring, training and is in the process of initiating a new curriculum and incentive program designed specifically for relative caregivers.  The Choctaw Nation works with 35 relative caregivers and makes available training and information through a coordinated effort with the local resource and referral agency.  

The Delaware Tribe, which supports 57 family child care homes that provide care for 436 children, has begun to develop linkages with the business community to support them in meeting the needs of their employees.  In FY 2002 the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians served 162 children in relative care settings, representing 75  percent of all children served with CCDF funds.  The Eastern Shawnee Tribe requires all providers to be state licensed and currently serve 185 children.  They provide  parent support initiatives including quarterly parenting education classes.  

Each tribal participant has made an investment in addressing the needs of families in its tribal community and will be able to expand its capabilities through furthering partnerships and participation in this national demonstration and evaluation project.   The evolving partnership between the tribal child care programs and the state child care resource and referral agencies represents a unique and historic opportunity for all Oklahoma’s communities to work together on behalf of young children. 

The Family and Work Institute (FWI) established “Sparking Connections,” a national research and demonstration initiative with the following goals: 1) to expand the knowledge base about how to enhance the child care provided by family, friend and neighbor caregivers, including the roles that retailers and other employers can play; 2) to design, demonstrate and document strategies to support a productive workforce by connecting employees and their family, friend and neighbor caregivers to useful community resources; and 3) to share what is learned with employers, families, communities, funders and policy makers throughout the nation. 

Based on information collected during Phase I of the Sparking Connections project, seven to ten pilot sites have been selected to test and evaluate strategies and examples of how to help improve the quality of care by family, friend and neighbor caregivers during Phase II.   

The “Oklahoma Sparking Connections” (administered by The Oklahoma Childcare Resource and Referral Association ) site has been selected as one of the approximately ten sites participating in Phase II.  This site is unique because it will serve as a model statewide initiative demonstrating collaboration between five Indian Tribes (Cherokee Nation, Choctaw Nation, Delaware Tribe, Eastern Shawnee Tribe and United Keetoowah Band) and the Oklahoma Child Care Resource and Referral Association, Inc.  Specifically, this project will: 1) demonstrate and evaluate services provided by Tribes to family members who care for children or whose children receive a Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) subsidy for child care; 2) demonstrate successful collaboration between child care resource and referral, Tribes and retailers to meet the needs of families in their communities; and 3) engage employers in activities to improve the quality of child care received by children of their employees and other children in the communities.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO

AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN

NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with venders capable of providing short-term, project-based specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of projects that support programs and NOAA’s overall mission.  The type of projects include services to collect and analyze scientific data, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, implementing program plans, providing litigation support, and coordinating program/project actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge combined with detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements to small businesses holding MOBIS Contracts (SIN 874) under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The first task order to be placed against the BPA is also included with this announcement.  

Small businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874) who are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the attached documents.  These documents include:  (1) A detailed Request For Quotation (RFQ-07_08_04); the prospective Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA 07_09_2004); and the first task order (BPA Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Jeffrey Bean, 586-574-7860
<DESC>The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command intends to solicit a proposal for research and development services in the area of intelligent software that will facilitate adjustably autonomous robotic control.  The Army's vision of the  future for armored and mechanized military structure includes the use of mixed teams of human and robotic forces on a dynamic and rapidly changing battlefield. Successful implementation of this vision will require autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic fo rces and a command and control infrastructure that will allow human, robotic, and mixed teams to be controlled quickly and easily. For maximum effectiveness this infrastructure should allow human commanders to control the robot teams in a manner similar to  how they command human teams, that is, in the language of the military, not the language of robotic control theory. Furthermore, the human interface for robotic command and control must simplify the controller's tasks and automate processes in such a way that the cognitive workload is reduced, situational awareness is enhanced, and situational control is preserved.  It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded to Soar Technology, Inc. of Ann Arbor, MI without competition.  The contract may extend up to three years if all options are exercised.  A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated. The estimated release d ate of the request for proposals is 26 July 2004, closing 9 Sep 2004. Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Administrative Support Center (CASC), Acquisitions Management Division (AMD) intends to procure the collection of socioeconomic data for the South Atlantic shrimp fishery for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Fisheries Economics Office, Southeast Regional Office (SERO) in St. Petersburg, Florida.  The purpose of the proposed work is to expand the socioeconomic data collection program for shrimp fishing craft in the Gulf of Mexico to those that primarily land their shrimp in the South Atlantic (i.e. East Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina).  Research has shown that, in general, personal interviews are more successful in collecting high quality data compared to phone or mail interviews.  The in-person approach has been shown to have a strong positive effect on response rates.  This effect is particularly important in the case of a voluntary data collection, which this program is structured to be at this time.  Activities associated with the following tasks are expected to commence in September 2004 and be completed no later than August 2005.  Task 1:  The contractor will conduct an intense, high quality outreach and education program for South Atlantic shrimpers regarding the socioeconomic data collection program.  The program will primarily consist of informal one-on-one or small group meetings between the SERO economist, contractor, and shrimp fishermen in ports/communities deemed to be of importance to the fishery.  Task II:  Contractor’s interviewers must be trained in the protocols outlined in the program’s survey training manual.  Task III:  The NMFS shrimp economist will provide the contractor with the universe of identified shrimp fishing craft.  The contractor will stratify the universe of the fishing craft according to the agreed upon strata.  The contractor must develop means to test and correct for the presence of survey response bias so that statistics based on the collected data will be as accurate and representative as possible.  Task IV:  The contractor will work with the NMFS shrimp economist to make any necessary changes to the survey instrument used in the Gulf of Mexico with respect to its wording, organization, and content for the purpose of its implementation in the South Atlantic.  The final version should be designed to facilitate data entry into computer files.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must approve the final survey instrument.  Task V:  Based on the stratified, random sample developed under Task III, the contractor shall contact vessel owners and operators, schedule interviews, and then use the OMB approved survey instrument (TASK IV) to conduct at least 260 personal interviews with shrimp fishermen who reside in or whose vessels operate out of ports in east Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina to collect the desired information.  Task VI:  The contractor shall enter the data into electronic files that can be read and manipulated by the NMFS shrimp economist using IBM-compatible personal computers.  Task VII:  The contractor shall provide progress reports after each three (3) month time period, beginning on the effective date of the contract.  Ten months after the effective date of the contract, the contractor shall prepare a draft final report that describes all training that took place, the final stratified, random sampling design, and changes to the original survey instrument, sampling design, database structure, and/or interview procedures and submit the draft to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR).  The NMFS economist will review the draft and return it to the Contractor within thirty (30) days.  The final report, inclusive of the final version of the survey database, will be provided to the COR no later than two (2) months after the COR approves the draft.

<DESC>Market Research for the Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP) Process Introduction The Project Manager Tactical Vehicles (PM-TV), in conjunction with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Systems Manager for Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) Modernization and the Directorate of Combat Development for Transportation (DCD-TC), is committ ed to the goals and performance of a Joint Expeditionary Force, focusing on increasing the relevance and readiness of our TWV fleet, and ensuring that the best possible product is available to support the current force and beyond.  The EMIP is a multi-phas ed, continuous process designed to improve the current and future TWV fleet by identifying and leveraging industryÃ¢Â€Â™s investments in advanced technologies, and to allow for insertion of these technologies as quickly as possible. The EMIP process offers to the Government and the contractor: 	A single point of contact with coordinated reviews. 	The capabilities to more rapidly take advantage of innovations in technology. 	The flexibility and agility to both take advantage of capabilities offered by rapidly changing technologies as well as to meet the challenges imposed by GWOT and the requirement to transform to a modular, expeditionary Army. The current TWV fleet is composed of the M915 Series of Trucks, Palletized Load System (PLS), Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET), Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and High Mobility Multi-purpose Whee led Vehicle (HMMWV) families of vehicles, as well as all associated trailers. This process applies to those vehicles that PM TV manages.  The Tank-automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC) manages vehicles no longer in production as well as all spares.  Suggestions concerning vehicles no longer in production and managed by ILSC will be directed to the appropriate item manager.  Market Research for Technical Capabilities for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles: PM TV is seeking technology that will improve the capabilities of the current fleet with regard to agility / versatility, deployability, responsiveness, sustainability, and survivability to support continuous future force operations with the right products  at the right time for the right price.  Although all ideas/concepts to improve the fleet will be considered, this process will address those technologies that can be available for production within six months of completion of verification testing and addr ess concepts that are at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or better. This is defined as an actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration.   Contractor submissions will be given consideration based on a number of characteristics, both in terms of cost and performance.  Such consideration will focus on numerous factors including the extent of the technological relevance in relation to user requi rements and/or technological reduction in life cycle costs. The following are examples of capabilities desired (non-prioritized list): 	Maintainability 	Increased reliability 	Decreased Intervals between services 	Reduced Number of Tools 	Reduced Non-operator organic maintenance tasks 	Decreased Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 	Reduced Operator/Maintenance Training 	On-Board Diagnostics/Prognostics, including 	Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) 	Automated Preventative Maintenance Checklist (PMC) 	Survivability 	Armor 	Force Protection/Self-Defense 	Mobility 	Network Centricity (C4ISR) 	Integrated Hardware/Mass Storage Suite 	Open Software Architecture, incorporating: 	Non-Line of Sight 2 Way Communications 	Integrated Blue Force Tracking 	Soldier-Machine Interface 	Line-of-Sight (LOS) Convoy Communications 	Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tracking/Automated Inventory Control 	Distribution 	Operational Range  	Greater Distances 	Fuel Efficiency 	Deployability 	Human Factors 	Force Sustainment 	On-board Power Generation 	On-board Water Generation Technology priorities are as follows: 	Technologies applicable to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) applications  	Enhancements in present vehicle capabilities (growth from Threshold to Objective requirements.) 	Significant reductions in life cycle costs for truck and trailer fleets The government will compare the capabilities of the technology candidates with the vehicle specifications and applicable Operational Requirements Document ORD/Capabilities Program Document (CPD)Capabilities Development Document(CDD) requirements.  These do cuments can be made available by request.  Each technology candidate submission by a single contractor must be submitted separate from other technology candidates unless multiple technologies are so intricately related that one technology could not perform  without the inclusion of additional technologies.  In this case, the technology candidates should be submitted as a single technology with enough explanation given of their relationship for the government to make an informed decision on the suitability of  the technology for the TWV fleet. Process The contractor will make his initial submission to the Government via Mailbox (PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil) by 1 September 04.  Failure to provide the requested information (Appendix A) by this date will preclude a contractor from participating in the next annual Government Rodeo, however the technology will be considered for any later Rodeos.   Please be advised that this EMIP process seeks to address those technologies that can be available for production within six months of completion of verification testing and address concepts that are at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or better. This i s defined as an actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration  The format for this submission will be IAW Appendix A.  Once the Government confirms receipt, the EMIP process will continue as follows:  	Review of the technical capability will be done within 60 days of receipt. 	The Government will review for applicability as well as technology readiness level. 	If the Government determines that the technology is appropriate for demonstration, it will provide a recommendation for demonstration and/or request for additional data. 	If the Government determines that the proposal is not a candidate for the EMIP process, then a recommendation will be provided to the contractor as to the appropriate disposition. In the event that it has been determined that a demonstration is appropriate, there are two options available.   First, it must be stressed that all such demonstrations are both optional and at the expense of the contractor.  The demonstration of items will in no way express or imply an obligation by the Government to purchase or otherwise acquire the items demonstra ted or displayed.  Moreover, the Government is not bound or obligated in any way to give special consideration to any demonstrating vendor on future contracts as a result of the EMIP process or demonstration.   The value of the demonstrations is that contractors can provide a much more persuasive case for the technology than can be provided by written documentation alone. The following are the different variations of the demonstrations:  	Government Rodeo (Annual) - The rodeos are a formal demonstration which will be offered in conjunction with the annual TWV conference held in Monterey, California each year in the Jan-Feb timeframe as sponsored by the National Defense Industrial Associati on (NDIA).  The first rodeo will be conducted at the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in the same week as the TWV conference and Army leadership will be in attendance. More detail on the rodeo is provided in Appendix B. 	Alternative demo (Continuous) - Location to be determined by contract or with Government concurrence (e.g.: Government proving ground, private proving ground, contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s facility).  This alternative offers more flexibility for schedule.  However, Government participation will be more limited than with the scheduled ro deos because only one demonstration will be ongoing. Upon completion of the demonstration, the Government will make an internal acquisition decision. Conclusion: The key advantage of this process is that it provides a focused, standardized approach to introducing new capabilities to PM Tactical Vehicles, as well as to provide input into ongoing analysis, including the Analysis of Alternatives and Analysis of Materi el Alternatives, being conducted for future TWV fleets. This is an iterative process and will be defined and improved over time.  PM TV, TSM-TWVM, and DCD-TC welcomes all technological ideas/concepts and would like to thank all industry participants for th eir commitment to the improvement of the TWV fleet. Appendix A: The EMIP Submission Contractors will initially submit the following information that briefly describes the idea/technology and the estimated benefits and costs.  The following information is required: 1.	General Information: 	a.	Company Name. 	b.	Address. 	c.	Company Telephone Number. 	d.	Company Website if applicable. 	e.	POC name, title/position, telephone number, and email address. 	f.  	Please indicate your companyÃ¢Â€Â™s type of business (large, small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned, or 8(a))?  Is your company located in a labor surplus area of Hub-zone (See FAR 19 Ã¢Â€Â“ Small Business Programs). 	g.	List your North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. 2.	Synopsis of Manufacturing/Technological Capability Ã¢Â€Â“ A description of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s manufacturing operations and capabilities.  Corporate literature or brochures are adequate.  The concept should be producible within a six month period from co ntract award and at TRL 8 or better. 3.	Synopsis of idea/concept and perceived benefits/cost to the Government.  Describe the perceived benefit to the TWV fleet (to what vehicle(s) does the technology apply?), the capability gap or requirement the technology would fill, how the technology wou ld affect the vehicle production cost, sustainment cost, and life cycle cost, and what this technology would replace or enhance. Please email the white paper to the following email address:   PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil. If any part of the submission cannot be sent electronically, mail the submission in its entirety to the following POC/address: Commander U.S. Army Tank Ã¢Â€Â“automotive and Armaments Command ATTN:  AMSTA-TR-E/HTV  MS 429  (EMIP Program) 6501 E. Eleven Mile Road Warren, MI  48397-5000 Please ensure your proposal is complete IAW the information requested above.  Incomplete proposals will not be accepted. Failure to submit provide the requested information (Appendix A) by 1 September 2004 will preclude a contractor from participating in the next annual Government Rodeo, however the technology will be considered for any later Rodeos. Appendix B:  Technology Rodeo #1 The first Annual Technology Rodeo will be held at the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in February 05.  The EMIP Process will be the primary source for candidate technologies to be presented at the rodeo.  The rodeo will allow component technology deve lopers/manufacturers to demonstrate their products in front of key acquisition, test and R&D representatives.  This first rodeo will address component technologies rather than complete vehicle systems. These will be technologies which will be suitable for incorporation on either current or future vehicle systems.  The priorities and types of technologies are in the  EMIP announcement. An opportunity to demonstrate complete vehicle systems is expected to be prov ided in a later rodeo (FY06) for which details will be announced at a later date.    In order to gain entry into the Technology Rodeo process, the following steps apply: 	Contractors must first submit information requested in the EMIP announcement outlining their concept and perceived benefits to the EMIP mailbox PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil.  Specific submission requirements are shown in Appendix A. 	If the Government has decided that the concept is at the appropriate technology level and the contractor wants it to be demonstrated at the rodeo, the contractor at his option and expense would contact the organizer, National Defense Industrial Associatio n (NDIA) for registration. 	Once this registration is completed the contractor would enter into discussions with NATC in order to begin planning the actual demonstration.  NATC contact information will be provided at a later date.  All costs for test courses, required labs, and supp ort expenses must be negotiated between NATC and the contractor.  The contractor is solely responsible for the design and conduct of the demonstration as well as all associated costs. 	The only participants for the process will be demonstrators, Government personnel, and Government support contractor personnel. 	If a contractor desires to participate in the component rodeo, it is necessary for them to submit their white paper NLT 1 September 2004 in order to allow sufficient time for the Government to review and provide a recommendation prior to NDIA/NATCÃ¢Â€Â™s cutoff for registration of 1 November 2004.   	Demonstration/Rodeo Agreement/Release Form must be signed and submitted prior to participation in the Demonstration or Rodeo. Once again, more detail on Rodeo #1, to include NATC and NDIA contact information, will be provided at a later date.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for microfilm/microfiche duplication services for NARA. The proposed requirement provides for the acquisition of all management, facilities, supervision, personnel, shipping, supplies, and equipment necessary to duplicate requested microfilm and microfiche. NARA is the repository for the permanently valuable records of the Federal Government.  Under the authority of 44 U.S.C. 2307, the National Archives Trust Fund Board conducts the NARA microfilm publication program that provides the general public with access to records of high interest through the sale of microfilm copies of archival records.
NARA has more than 3,300 individual microfilm publications, consisting of anywhere from one roll to several thousand rolls each. This contract proposes to replace the current contract so that more of NARA’s microfilm and microfiche products can be reproduced by a contractor on an “as needed” basis.  Such a contract will allow NARA to concentrate its microfilm services on the preservation of permanent records. The contract awarded as a result of this RFP will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated. The term of the contract will be for a base period of twelve (12) months with four (4) 12-month option periods. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about July 16, 2004, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any. All Contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition. Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFP through their e-mail addresses. No telephone or fax RFP requests will be accepted. *****

<DESC>It is the intent of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to award, on a single source basis, pursuant to the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501), a one year base, with a one year option, task order under GSA contract number GS35F0426K, with Global Computer Enterprises, a small business.  Global Computer Enterprises is the current contractor providing maintenance of the US Coast Guard’s Oracle Financial System (CGOF) under task order DTCG23-04-F-HFG022.   As a result of a system audit, the USCG requires  services to remediate the audit findings and correct a backlog of System Problem Reports (SPRs).   Since the current contractor has considerable knowledge of the CGOF system this will save the Government in technical, cost, and time efficiencies.  Also, it is imperative that only the current contractor be permitted to correct the baseline code and the identified SPRs.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  The USCG will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 PM EDT, on July 16, 2004.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services.  Request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a single source award will be made to Global Computer Enterprises.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 01:  The pre-proposal conference is scheduled for 10:00am (local time) at the same location and day identified in the Request For Quotation.  ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with venders capable of providing short-term, project-based specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of projects that support programs and NOAA’s overall mission.  The type of projects include services to collect and analyze scientific data, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, implementing program plans, providing litigation support, and coordinating program/project actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge combined with detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements to small businesses holding MOBIS Contracts (SIN 874) under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The first task order to be placed against the BPA is also included with this announcement.  

Small businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874) who are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the attached documents.  These documents include:  (1) A detailed Request For Quotation (RFQ-07_08_04); the prospective Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA 07_09_2004); and the first task order (BPA Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The proposed release date for this RFQ is hereby revised to 'on or about THURSDAY, JULY 15, 2004. 

Under Request for Quotation, TIRNO-04-Q-00096, the IRS has a requirement to provide CULTURAL AWARENESS and SENSITIVITY TRAINING to its employees.  To accomplish this goal, the IRS seeks to make a 1-time purchase of an existing, commercially-available ‘off-the-shelf’ training package on how to recognize, appreciate, be aware and sensitive to the cultural differences of the taxpayer community.  The ultimate goal is for the IRS to be able to train approximately 90,000 IRS employees nation-wide, who have varying levels of interface with taxpayers.  The IRS wants the rights to the training materials in order to be able to modify the training materials to suit the needs of its employees on a geographical and/or cultural basis.  The existing training should be designed for traditional classroom delivery (paper-based) as well as e-learning/on-line delivery.  The training materials should also have an instructor’s manual.  This commercial training package should also provide a ‘train-the-trainer’ component.  It is anticipated that there will be a ‘pilot’ period where the IRS will modify the training materials to meet its specific needs; the Contractor will provide assistance to the IRS during the ‘pilot’ phase.  At the conclusion of the ‘pilot’ phase, the final version will accepted and the ‘train-the-trainer’ classes will be completed.  It is anticipated that the ‘pilot’ phase will not exceed 6 months.  The entire proposed period of performance will not exceed 12 months.  Vendors will be evaluated on past performance/experience; key personnel; compliance with 508 requirements and price.   This will be a 100% small business set-aside requirement (Numbered Note 1 applicable).  Interested parties will be able to access the RFQ from the IRS Procurement website at http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/ ON OR ABOUT THURSDAY, JULY 15, 2004.  Questions concerning this requirement shall be sent via e-mail to the contracting officer @ Helen.D.Carmona@irs.gov

If you are interested only in subcontracting opportunities please indicate clearly in your submission. The SOC shall not exceed twenty pages. The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Government will not pay any costs associated with the submittal of information solicited herein.

<DESC>Market Research for the Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure (EMIP) Process Introduction The Project Manager Tactical Vehicles (PM-TV), in conjunction with the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Systems Manager for Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV) Modernization and the Directorate of Combat Development for Transportation (DCD-TC), is committ ed to the goals and performance of a Joint Expeditionary Force, focusing on increasing the relevance and readiness of our TWV fleet, and ensuring that the best possible product is available to support the current force and beyond.  The EMIP is a multi-phas ed, continuous process designed to improve the current and future TWV fleet by identifying and leveraging industryÃ¢Â€Â™s investments in advanced technologies, and to allow for insertion of these technologies as quickly as possible. The EMIP process offers to the Government and the contractor: Ã¢Â€Â¢	A single point of contact with coordinated reviews. Ã¢Â€Â¢	The capabilities to more rapidly take advantage of innovations in technology. Ã¢Â€Â¢	The flexibility and agility to both take advantage of capabilities offered by rapidly changing technologies as well as to meet the challenges imposed by GWOT and the requirement to transform to a modular, expeditionary Army. The current TWV fleet is composed of the M915 Series of Trucks, Palletized Load System (PLS), Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET), Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT), Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and High Mobility Multi-purpose Whee led Vehicle (HMMWV) families of vehicles, as well as all associated trailers. This process applies to those vehicles that PM TV manages.  The Tank-automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) Integrated Logistics Support Center (ILSC) manages vehicles no longer in production as well as all spares.  Suggestions concerning vehicles no longer in production and managed by ILSC will be directed to the appropriate item manager.  Market Research for Technical Capabilities for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles: PM TV is seeking technology that will improve the capabilities of the current fleet with regard to agility / versatility, deployability, responsiveness, sustainability, and survivability to support continuous future force operations with the right products  at the right time for the right price.  Although all ideas/concepts to improve the fleet will be considered, this process will address those technologies that can be available for production within six months of completion of verification testing and addr ess concepts that are at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or better. This is defined as an actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration.   Contractor submissions will be given consideration based on a number of characteristics, both in terms of cost and performance.  Such consideration will focus on numerous factors including the extent of the technological relevance in relation to user requi rements and/or technological reduction in life cycle costs. The following are examples of capabilities desired (non-prioritized list): 	Maintainability 	Increased reliability 	Decreased Intervals between services 	Reduced Number of Tools 	Reduced Non-operator organic maintenance tasks 	Decreased Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 	Reduced Operator/Maintenance Training 	On-Board Diagnostics/Prognostics, including 	Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) 	Automated Preventative Maintenance Checklist (PMC) 	Survivability 	Armor 	Force Protection/Self-Defense 	Mobility 	Network Centricity (C4ISR) 	Integrated Hardware/Mass Storage Suite 	Open Software Architecture, incorporating: 	Non-Line of Sight 2 Way Communications 	Integrated Blue Force Tracking 	Soldier-Machine Interface 	Line-of-Sight (LOS) Convoy Communications 	Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Tracking/Automated Inventory Control 	Distribution 	Operational Range  	Greater Distances 	Fuel Efficienc y 	Deployability 	Human Factors 	Force Sustainment 	On-board Power Generation 	On-board Water Generation Technology priorities are as follows: 	Technologies applicable to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) applications  	Enhancements in present vehicle capabilities (growth from Threshold to Objective requirements.) 	Significant reductions in life cycle costs for truck and trailer fleets The government will compare the capabilities of the technology candidates with the vehicle specifications and applicable Operational Requirements Document ORD/Capabilities Program Document CPD/Capabilities Development Document (CDD) requirements.  These do cuments can be made available by request.  Each technology candidate submission by a single contractor must be submitted separate from other technology candidates unless multiple technologies are so intricately related that one technology could not perform  without the inclusion of additional technologies.  In this case, the technology candidates should be submitted as a single technology with enough explanation given of their relationship for the government to make an informed decision on the suitability of  the technology for the TWV fleet. Process The contractor will make his initial submission to the Government via Mailbox (PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil) by 1 September 04.  Failure to provide the requested information (Appendix A) by this date will preclude a contractor from participating in the next annual Government Rodeo, however the technology will be considered for any later Rodeos.   Please be advised that this EMIP process seeks to address those technologies that can be available for production within six months of completion of verification testing and address concepts that are at a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 8 or better. This i s defined as an actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration  The format for this submission will be IAW Appendix A.  Once the Government confirms receipt, the EMIP process will continue as follows:  	Review of the technical capability will be done within 60 days of receipt. 	The Government will review for applicability as well as technology readiness level. 	If the Government determines that the technology is appropriate for demonstration, it will provide a recommendation for demonstration and/or request for additional data. 	If the Government determines that the proposal is not a candidate for the EMIP process, then a recommendation will be provided to the contractor as to the appropriate disposition. In the event that it has been determined that a demonstration is appropriate, there are two options available.   First, it must be stressed that all such demonstrations are both optional and at the expense of the contractor.  The demonstration of items will in no way express or imply an obligation by the Government to purchase or otherwise acquire the items demonstra ted or displayed.  Moreover, the Government is not bound or obligated in any way to give special consideration to any demonstrating vendor on future contracts as a result of the EMIP process or demonstration.   The value of the demonstrations is that contractors can provide a much more persuasive case for the technology than can be provided by written documentation alone. The following are the different variations of the demonstrations:  	Government Rodeo (Annual) - The rodeos are a formal demonstration which will be offered in conjunction with the annual TWV conference held in Monterey, California each year in the Jan-Feb timeframe as sponsored by the National Defense Industrial Associati on (NDIA).  The first rodeo will be conducted at the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in the same week as the TWV conference and Army leadership will be in attendance. More detail on the rodeo is provided in Appendix B. 	Alternative demo (Continuous) - Location to be dete rmined by contractor with Government concurrence (e.g.: Government proving ground, private proving ground, contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s facility).  This alternative offers more flexibility for schedule.  However, Government participation will be more limited than wit h the scheduled rodeos because only one demonstration will be ongoing. Upon completion of the demonstration, the Government will make an internal acquisition decision. Conclusion: The key advantage of this process is that it provides a focused, standardized approach to introducing new capabilities to PM Tactical Vehicles, as well as to provide input into ongoing analysis, including the Analysis of Alternatives and Analysis of Materi el Alternatives, being conducted for future TWV fleets. This is an iterative process and will be defined and improved over time.  PM TV, TSM-TWVM, and DCD-TC welcomes all technological ideas/concepts and would like to thank all industry participants for th eir commitment to the improvement of the TWV fleet. Appendix A: The EMIP Submission Contractors will initially submit the following information that briefly describes the idea/technology and the estimated benefits and costs.  The following information is required: 1. General Information: 	a.	Company Name. 	b.	Address. 	c.	Company Telephone Number. 	d.	Company Website if applicable. 	e.	POC name, title/position, telephone number, and email address. 	f.  	Please indicate your companyÃ¢Â€Â™s type of business (large, small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned, or 8(a))?  Is your company located in a labor surplus area of Hub-zone (See FAR 19 Ã¢Â€Â“ Small Business Programs). 	g.	List your North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes, Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. 2. Synopsis of Manufacturing/Technological Capability Ã¢Â€Â“ A description of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s manufacturing operations and capabilities.  Corporate literature or brochures are adequate.  The concept should be producible within a six month period from co ntract award and at TRL 8 or better. 3. Synopsis of idea/concept and perceived benefits/cost to the Government.  Describe the perceived benefit to the TWV fleet to what vehicle(s) does the technology apply?, the capability gap or requirement the technology would fill, how the technology would  affect the vehicle production cost, sustainment cost, and life cycle cost, and what this technology would replace or enhance. Please email the white paper to the following email address:   PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil. If any part of the submission cannot be sent electronically, mail the submission in its entirety to the following POC/address: Commander U.S. Army Tank Ã¢Â€Â“automotive and Armaments Command ATTN:  AMSTA-TR-E/HTV  MS 429  (EMIP Program) 6501 E. Eleven Mile Road Warren, MI  48397-5000 Please ensure your proposal is complete IAW the information requested above.  Incomplete proposals will not be accepted. Failure to submit provide the requested information (Appendix A) by 1 September 2004 will preclude a contractor from participating in the next annual Government Rodeo, however the technology will be considered for any later Rodeos. Appendix B:  Technology Rodeo #1 The first Annual Technology Rodeo will be held at the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in February 05.  The EMIP Process will be the primary source for candidate technologies to be presented at the rodeo.  The rodeo will allow component technology deve lopers/manufacturers to demonstrate their products in front of key acquisition, test and R&D representatives.  This first rodeo will address component technologies rather than complete vehicle systems. These will be technologies which will be suitable for incorporation on either current or future vehicle systems.  The priorities and types of technologies are in the  EMIP announcement. An opportunity to demonstrate complete vehicle systems is exp ected to be provided in a later rodeo (FY06) for which details will be announced at a later date.    In order to gain entry into the Technology Rodeo process, the following steps apply: 	Contractors must first submit information requested in the EMIP announcement outlining their concept and perceived benefits to the EMIP mailbox PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil.  Specific submission requirements are shown in Appendix A. 	If the Government has decided that the concept is at the appropriate technology level and the contractor wants it to be demonstrated at the rodeo, the contractor at his option and expense would contact the organizer, National Defense Industrial Associatio n (NDIA) for registration. 	Once this registration is completed the contractor would enter into discussions with NATC in order to begin planning the actual demonstration.  NATC contact information will be provided at a later date.  All costs for test courses, required labs, and supp ort expenses must be negotiated between NATC and the contractor.  The contractor is solely responsible for the design and conduct of the demonstration as well as all associated costs. 	The only participants for the process will be demonstrators, Government personnel, and Government support contractor personnel. 	If a contractor desires to participate in the component rodeo, it is necessary for them to submit their white paper NLT 1 September 2004 in order to allow sufficient time for the Government to review and provide a recommendation prior to NDIA/NATCÃ¢Â€Â™s cutoff for registration of 1 November 2004.  Entrance into this process after this point will be handled on a case by case basis by PM-TV representatives. 	Demonstration/Rodeo Agreement/Release Form must be signed and submitted prior to participation in the Demonstration or Rodeo. Once again, more detail on Rodeo #1, to include NATC and NDIA contact information, will be provided at a later date.

<DESC>The Government is seeking potential sources with the capability to provide technologies that will directly replace 8-millimeter (mm) videotape duplication, playback and other processes in use today in Shipboard Information, Training, and Entertainment (SITE) systems.  SITE systems are installed aboard U.S. Navy ships and submarines and some Military Sealift Command (MSC) vessels.  Technologies must provide state-of-the-art solution(s) capable of 10 or more years of service life for the functions of content encoding and encryption; media duplication and distribution; and key management, decryption, and content playback.  It is essential that all solutions share a common security platform that includes at a minimum AES-128 encryption, decryption and key management functions. A prospective vendor’s conference will be held on 22 July 2004 during which the Government will present its concept for the use of hard disk drives (HDD), standard digital versatile disk (DVD), and encrypted-DVD (eDVD) to distribute television content to ships at sea and in port around the world. The Government will also present its concept for a centralized duplication facility to service the entire U.S. Navy Fleet and its desire to migrate to a shipboard video server, file-based architecture.  This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.The state-of-the-art has advanced considerably since the original SITE system design and the Government is now faced with a videotape format that is practically extinct.  The Government intends to install video server technology aboard ship to replace 8-mm videotape legacy hardware, and use HDDs to provide ships with an initial (approximate) 600-hour library of non time-sensitive programming.  This library will supplement satellite delivered television programming already in place and fully operational to nearly 75-percent of the Fleet.  Once the library is installed ships will receive a monthly refresh packages, also on HDD, consisting of approximately 100 hours of replacement television programming.  The Government intends to outfit its existing videotape duplication facilities with DVD duplication systems to provide “special,” time-sensitive programming to ships within a specific region on unencrypted DVDs.The Government intends to utilize eDVD technology to distribute encrypted commercial movies to ships.  Two delivery methods are being considered:  (1) encrypted movie files will be written to HDD and delivered to ships for uploading into video servers and network storage on most SITE systems.  The Government is considering whether to also provide ships with eDVD media for backup and long term storage of encrypted movie content; or (2) Movies will be provided to ships on eDVD media only.  Regardless of delivery method, the Government intends to utilize eDVDs in two applications – in a stand-alone player and as a source media for video servers.  A playback appliance, such as an eDVD player, is envisioned to support the stand-alone application.  The Government intends the eDVD player to fit both tabletop and equipment rack mounting scenarios, and that it be capable of operating on universal, worldwide A.C. power.  The Government envisions that video servers be equipped with hardware and software capable of extracting the encrypted movie files from the eDVD media for storage on local (within the server) HDD.  It follows that the video server must also be equipped with the necessary hardware and software to decrypt the movie file, but only at the time of playback (MPEG decode).  File decryption must be a closed process and the video server must not allow access or storage of any decrypted files.  Video server and encryption/decryption vendors are highly encouraged to form a teaming relationship in order to facilitate this requirement.  The Government is interested in those vendors that have a key management system or program that is capable of affecting control over the authorization of eDVD players and decryption-capable video servers.The Government plans to design its next generation SITE system with a minimum of four server-based playback channels.  Video servers must include automated playback control and onboard, internal storage capacities that will provide for a minimum of four days of unattended playback for each of the four channels.  The Government envisions a Gigabit Ethernet network in its next generation SITE systems to facilitate the use of networked file storage.  Approximately 4.5 terabytes (TB) of usable network storage will be required to store the estimated 800 full-length movies in an encrypted form, the television library described above and its refresh shipments, and the remaining capacity will be used to store local shipboard production and training material.  The Government intends for all content to be encoded at an average of 4.0 Megabits per second using MPEG-2 main profile at main level compression with the maximum encode rate being 6.0 Mbps.The Government desires a fully automated workflow for both duplication and shipboard playback functions.  It is desired that a centralized system be devised to allow multiple duplication facilities to master and distribute the same product to all ships worldwide.  A playlist file (created by the centralized system) is envisioned to contain sufficient data to allow a simple automation system -- included with one or more video servers -- to automatically play back four channels of programming aboard ship without the need for human intervention over a period of not less than four days.The Government is interested in off-the-shelf technologies only that can provide a significant improvement in the density of programming hours per unit of media presently available with videotape; technologies that are capable of automation yet can also be fully manipulated by shipboard operators; technologies that will facilitate “faster than real time” transfer of programming between integral parts of a playback architecture; and technologies that are scalable in terms of numbers of playback channels, drives, or both, and in terms of quality of playback (probably controlled during the encoding process).  The Government is interested in technologies that offer access to open architecture computer operating and file systems, computer network systems and that are compliant with commercial broadcast standards such as MPEG-2 or later.Because of the tight integration required between video servers, eDVD components, and the required encryption and decryption technologies, the Government will host a prospective vendors conference on 22 July 2004.  The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for the Government to present and for prospective vendors to question matters of workflow, encryption technology, key management, and any other technical, operational, or system architecture considerations.  The conference will be held at the Defense Media Center, 1363 Z Street, Building 2730, March Air Reserve Base, CA 92518.  While the conference is open to any interested party, pre-registration is highly suggested.  The Government recognizes that multiple vendors may be required to work closely together in order to meet all requirements.  This conference is an opportunity for these relationships to be initialized and established.  A draft performance work statement (PWS) will be made available on or about July 15, 2004.  If you or your organization are involved in the areas of television program encoding, encryption, file storage, decoding, decrypting, key management, and playback technologies or otherwise believe that you have capabilities that can potentially benefit the SITE program, the Government is requesting such information.  Please mail, e-mail, or fax your response to this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice to the address listed below by not later than August 31, 2004.Responses must include:1.  Point of contact (company name, POC name, phone and fax numbers, and e-mail) who is familiar with your company’s activities.2.  Provide a brief description of your past, present, and future capabilities, activities, and programs related to broadcast automation and control systems, encoding and storage technologies, encryption and content security technologies, and decoding and playback technologies.3.  Provide information on your company’s past experience with deployment and implementation of technologies, lessons learned, merits and shortfalls, and unmet needs.4.  Indicate potential interest in being considered in the Government’s assessment of technologies as described.Depending on the responses, the Government may narrow the scope of focus and release modifications to this RFI/SSN.  The Government intends to conduct an assessment of all technologies within the narrowed scope if necessary.  All assessments will include three parts:(1) a functional assessment based on materials submitted and presentations by vendors;(2) a technical assessment lasting approximately five (5) working days based on a live demonstration of video playback technologies using programming material supplied by the Government, and hands-on experience by potential SITE system operators;  and (3) a technical and cost assessment by the Government based on data provided by the vendor.  Please send your responses to Mr. Jim Kuhrt by e-mail to kuhrt@mediacen.navy.mil, by fax to (202) 433-6412, or by mail to Naval Media Center, Broadcasting Department, Attn:  Mr. Jim Kuhrt, 2713 Mitscher Road, S.W., Anacostia Annex, DC 20373.  The Government may respond with a questionnaire to ascertain additional information about your technology(ies), and information from the questionnaire would be used during the various assessments described above.  This is an open and participative process.  Should you determine that sharing of some information is not desired, please clearly mark or indicate the specific portions, and we will make every effort to protect that data and honor your request.  Please respond by August 31, 2004.  Thank you for your interest and participation.

<DESC>Northern Region Contracting Center-Leavenworth is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors capable of providing development of an interface between the Advanced Warfighting Simulation (AWARS) and the Mobile Command and Control (MC2) system.  Co ntractors must be familiar with, and capable of extensively modifying the government-unique DaVinci suite of decision and software tools in order to perform this work.  The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis Center (TRAC) conducts analytic ex periments and studies utilizing combat simulations.  The simulation support ranges fro m small computer assisted map exercises to large experiments with 50-100 (or more) personnel.  Required experimentation support will be AWARS centric and will utilize in teractive command and control systems operating in real time.  The requirement to represent developmental Battle Command (BC) system functions will require the use of current surrogate systems.  MC2 is a candidate surrogate system for the future Warrior Ma chine Interface (WMI) and it has been designated as the command and control surrogate for TRADOC Battle Lab Collaborative Simulation Environment (BLCSE) experimentation.  TRAC seeks support for developing interfaces between AWARS and MC2.  The interfaces a re required to transmit MC2 scenario information to AWARS, to transmit AWARS scenario information to MC2 for federation initialization, to produce a MC2 Common Operational Picture (COP) from AWARS situation assessment data and to send player orders from MC 2 to AWARS for execution.  The contractor will perform the following tasks for Phase I:  Modify the MC2 Interface Message Processor (IMP) to use the DOD High Level Architecture (HLA) Application Program Interfaces (API).  The task includes design, developm ent, and documentation of methods for initialization, and sending and receiving messages between AWARS and the MC2 IMP; Modify the U.S. ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s MC2 to support AWARS situation assessment (SA) information.  The MC2 will be redesigned and developed to acc ept and display military unit SA information from AWARS.  The development task includes support for friendly and threat force SA; MC2 will be redesigned and developed to formulate requests for information, military orders, and simulation control commands a nd to transmit them to AWARS for execution.  The contractor will produce design documentation and deliver it to the government.  The following will be included:  information queries; military unit orders; simulation control orders; AWARS service responses;  AWARS military unit information updates and time updates; modify MC2 to support initialization from AWARS input data; modify MC2 to support Interactive Control Environment (ICE) type roles; develop test plans and conduct up to three sets of tests that sup port integration with AWARS; provide documentation for tasks.  Phase II (optional) tasks include:  MC2 will be developed to support AWARSÃ¢Â€Â™ dynamic creation of military unit entities, such as dynamic aircraft sortie creation; MC2 will be developed to c ompose a military unit plan for transmission to AWARS.  The plan will utilize an extended markup language (XML) format; MC2 will be developed to read a military unitÃ¢Â€Â™s plan that is transmitted from AWARS.  The plan will utilize an XML format; Develop test plans and conduct up to five sets of tests that support integration with AWARS.  The contractor must meet the requirement for clearance for access to classified information, up to and including SECRET.  All responses will be considered and must includ e proof of ability to extensively modify the existing MC2 architecture to develop a High Level Architecture (HLA) interface with the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s AWARS software and to develop all the required interfaces between MC2 and AWARS in a timely manner.  Provide GS A schedule contract number and labor categories and rates for this service.  Responses shall include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email  address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE Code.

<DESC>Northern Region Contracting Center-Leavenworth is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors capable of providing development of checkpoint/modify/restart capability for the Advanced Warfighting Simulation (AWARS) using Progress Software Corporat ionÃ¢Â€Â™s PSE Pro.  Contractors must be capable of providing additional development/modification of PSE Pro software.  AWARS requires a capability to save data from the model, change code and/or data, and then restart the simulation from a selected point.   PSE Pro provides an application programming interface (API) that allows storage of persistent C++ objects.  It provides support for a large data set, transaction and recovery capabilities, creation and manipulation of databases as operating system files,  transparent retrieval and storage of persistent objects, and recoverable save points. PSE Pro software allows simulations to store and retrieve data through its persistent object storage engine and eliminates the cumbersome and difficult writing and readi ng of data to and from flat files.  The contractor will perform the following tasks for Phase I:  Provide consultation services to review AWARS architecture, analyze load requirements, identify scalability issues, analyze integration issues, help design an  implementation plan, train AWARS programmers in the use of PSE Pro, develop use cases for C++ Standard Template Library and Dumpleton Software ConsultingÃ¢Â€Â™s OSE components used in AWARS, and assist in maximizing performance of AWARSÃ¢Â€Â™ implementati on of PSE Pro; provide general technical consultation, training, and expertise to support the in-house development of a checkpoint/modify/restart capability for AWARS using an implementation of PSE Pro; contractor will perform the following tasks for Phase  II (Optional) if exercised:  develop and provide a recommendation document for performance issues based on the results of Phase I and the analysis of PSE Pro software usage by government personnel; provide weekly consultation and training to maximize use of PSE Pro for AWARS study/exercise support.

The requirement involves the purchase of one-hundred fifteen (115) file/print servers; thirty-seven (37) rack mounted 1 U servers to replace domain controllers, web servers, DNS, SMTP MRTG, RPM and the APPS COOP servers; and two (2) rack mounted 6U or 7U servers to replace the current Cisco Works HQ back-up serve and the Memphis back-up servers.  In order to meet this potential requirement and defray costs, DCAA wishes to “trade-in” (for credit to be applied toward the purchase of the new servers) some of its existing servers that have become technically obsolete.  The following will apply to the trade in of these older servers:

(a)  All trade-in equipment will need to be packaged and picked up at a number of locations throughout the United States and Germany.   

(b)  The attached Excel file provides the necessary information for the trade-in equipment  including:  configuration, location, point of contact. 
 

(c)  DCAA personnel will sanitize all hard drives prior to trade-in.  A completed “Certification of Hard Drive Disposition” form will accompany each server. 

(d)  DCAA personnel will complete a “Certification of Computer Configuration/ Equipment for Exchange” form for each server traded in.  This form will indicate the exact specification of each server; it will all certify that the server is in good working order.

(e)  All costs associated with the trade-in of these servers (i.e., shipping/ handling fees, processing fees, etc) will be deducted from the “trade-in credit” received.  The Government would not award a separate contract to cover these costs.  

NEW EQUPMENT INFORMATION:

The replacement servers shall meet the minimum specifications provided below. All servers will be shipped to multiple DCAA locations within the continental United States.  All servers will be configured prior to delivery to the designated DCAA offices.  The type of maintenance/warranty required is supplied with each configuration.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. *** This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19. *** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516. *** The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Organic Transistor Probing System. All interested parties are invited to submit a quote for the following line items: LINE ITEM 0001: “The Supply and Installation of an Organic Transistor Probing System, in accordance with the following specifications:  A.  Background - The Organic Transistor Probing System for electrical device characterization will be used primarily for current-voltage (IV) and capacitance-voltage (CV) testing.  The goal is to test transistors made from organic materials.  Current responses from organic materials are extremely small requiring a very well-shielded environment from stray electrical fields.  Atmosphere control is required because the materials are very susceptible to oxidation and moisture.  Full automation is required because the unit will be put into a sealed glove box at a future date.  Thermal control of the sample is required without causing significant noise to measurement.  The station is required to be compatible with existing Cascade and RF probes.  An additional four probes with points shall be included.
B.  Description - Prober shall have a 8” x 8” manual stage with manual x, y, and theta controls .  
1)	Chuck shall rotate +/- 7 degrees
2)	Chuck shall be 8” diameter.  
3)	Prober shall be supplied with large area bridge mount that moves the microscope in a 6” y by 8” X format vertical manual lift. 
4)	Microscope shall 40X Microscope with remote Focus and digital Zoom. No eyepieces are required because it will be used in a glovebox. It needs to be provided with 5X and 10X A Zoom objectives.
5)	Chuck shall be thermal unit capable of a –55 C range to 200 C. Chuck shall be round. Plating shall be gold plated. Flatness: 2 mills. 
Residual capacitance: Chuck to Shield <2 Pico farads.
Chuck shall have 3 vacuum zones of increasing size to handle 4”, 6” and 8” wafers.
Isolation from chuck to shield shall be greater than 1 Teraohm at 500 volts DC at 25C. 
Unit shall have Auxiliary thermally isolation chucks. Each Auxiliary chuck shall have independent vacuum control. Auxiliary chucks shall be capable of holding contact substrates and calibration substrates while an 8” wafer is on main thermal chuck.
6)	With Microchamber installed, thermal system on, and ramping between -57 and 200 C, probe leakage with one probe on top of a device and the other terminal connected to the chuck, probe + chuck leakage shall not exceed 25 femptoamps on medium integration. Chuck residual capacitance shall be less than 2 pf and a capacitance variation shall be under 5 ff. 
7)	System is optimized for fast settling times and low current measurement capability needed to detect failure mechanisms on organic transistors.
8)	All controls to move stage and positioners shall be located outside of probing enclosure. The chamber must be designed so the operator’s body electric field does not effect the measurement.  Measurement repeatability is key to the NIST project.
9)	Chuck shall be housed in a Faraday cage that will provide a dark (light free), EMI shielded, controlled environment box. A nitrogen or dry compressed air inlet shall be supplied to rear of the probe chamber.  Prober shall be supplied with flowmeter.
10)	Prober shall be supplied with 2 left and 2 right 100 TPI vacuum based positioners. Each positioner must have a dual triax adapter that connects miniature triax to ssmc cables. The ssmc cable must exit in probing environment while triax connectors must mount outside top hat or Microchamber to maintain signal integrity.
11)	Prober shall be supplied with 4 Cascade DCP-150R probes or equivalent. These probes have an effective capacitance of approximately 46 ff or better in the measurement chamber. This is required to ensure fast settling times. The probe is also quasi Kelvin with dual 50 ohm ssmc connections. This helps the system achieve high accuracy capacitance measurements when used with frequency based test equipment and allows the user to null out cable resistance. The tips are replaceable. 10 replaceable probes with 5 micron tips shall be supplied.  Probe leakage shall be +/- 10 fa from –55 to 200 C. Breakdown voltage shall be greater than 500 volts.  Prober shall be supplied with a kit to allow connection of all four probes to triax manifold. This requires 4 ultra low noise low triboelectric cables with miniature triax to standard triax need to be used.  Triax Manifold shall have at least 4 bnc connectors for functional work, minimum of 8 triax connectors that can accept 4 quadrax connections and a vacuum manifold that supports at least 5 vacuum based positioners. Cables need to be supplied for all connections between 4284 for one and 2 meter connection options in 4 wire mode.  All coaxial cabling will be 50ohms.  Prober needs to be supplied with 2 mounting brackets for the Keithley Positioner mounted Pre amps along with short cables so low current measurements can be made.  Prober shall be capable of using customer owned  positioners which are Cascade Part Number DCM208VL, DCM208VR with Dual Triax Adapter 114-818 and DCP HTR which all connect together. A probe to probe short strap for connecting DCP probes together shall be supplied as specified in the application notes for a Agilent 4294  for high accuracy capacitance measurements. Also, an impedance standard substrate shall be supplied to Calibrate at the probe tips capacitance meters.
12)	Prober shall have a 360 degree platen capable of accepting 4 RF positioners or 8 DC positioners with dual triax adapters. Platen shall have a 2 mill deflection or less for a 10 lb lateral or vertical force.

BACKGROUND ON THIS PROCUREMENT:

NIST requires a complete atomic force microscope (AFM) system for high-magnification imaging of biomaterials and living cells consists of an AFM scanner, electronic controller, and computer with image acquisition and analysis software integrated with functions for performing imaging of biological materials under controlled physiological conditions.  These functions include a fluid-flow cell, an environmental chamber for maintaining gas pressure and mixtures of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and a heating stage and controller for maintaining the sample temperature environment at 37 degrees Celsius.  The AFM scanner must be capable of measuring topographic features of a sample using contact, intermittent, and noncontact (dynamic) modes in air and in fluid environments and be capable of sampling other sample properties, in particular the electrostatic surface potential, when using a conductive AFM probe that is suitably biased with a voltage relative to a sample, and have the capability to perform magnetic force imaging.  These measurements must be performed completely under software control with the AFM tip precisely retracted at a user selectable distance from the sample surface. 

The list of contract line items numbers and items, quantities and units of measure are as follows, for which detailed specifications are included in the reverse auction at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation:

ITEM NO. 0001, ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE (AFM) SYSTEM, QUANTITY: 1, UNIT, EACH, THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE FOLLOWING MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS:

Complete system consisting of an AFM scanner, electronic controller, and computer with image acquisition and analysis software.  The AFM scanner design must allow unobstructed top-down optical access of the AFM tip location relative to the scanned sample area with a high-magnification, long-working distance objective from directly above the AFM cantilever.  An optical viewing system is optional.  The two-dimensional sample translation stage of the microscope must be capable of accessing AFM imaging positions over a 1.5-centimeter diameter sample surface.  The system must be supplied with a vibration isolating table or stand.

The AFM scanner must have a lateral imaging range of at least 120 x 120 micrometers and a vertical range of at least 5 micrometers.  The noise level in the vertical direction must be less than 0.04 nanometers.  The methods used to meet these criteria must be specified. 

The AFM scanner must be capable of measuring topographic features of a sample using contact, intermittent, and noncontact (dynamic) modes in air and in fluid environments.  The controller must be capable of generating phase-detection and frequency-control information related to the cantilever oscillation in intermittent and noncontact modes.  The controller must be capable of displaying phase signal variations during imaging and contain active frequency-control circuitry to optimize the sensitivity and stability of the cantilever during imaging. 

ELECTROSTATIC AND MAGNETIC FORCE IMAGING MODES:

The AFM system must be capable of sampling other sample properties, in particular the electrostatic surface potential when using a conductive AFM probe that is suitably biased with a voltage relative to a sample.  The system should have the capability to perform magnetic imaging as well.  These measurements must be performed completely under software control with the AFM tip precisely retracted at a user selectable distance from the sample surface.

BIOLOGICAL IMAGING:

As delivered, the system must include functions for performing imaging of biological materials under physiological conditions.  These functions include a fluid-flow cell, an environmental chamber for maintaining gas pressure and mixtures of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and a heating stage and controller for maintaining the sample temperature environment at 37 degrees Celsius.

EXTERNAL SIGNAL ACCESS:

The AFM system must have the capability, either included or with optional Contractor-supplied hardware, for real-time monitoring, modifying, and displaying sensor and actuator input/output signals between the control unit and the AFM scanner.

solicitation requirements.  In conducting the performance risk evaluation, the government may use data provided by the offeror or the offeror's references, as well as data obtained from other sources.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of relevant facts and circumstances. The government is seeking to determine whether the offeror consistently has demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices. 
By past performance, the government means the offeror's record of conforming to 
contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship, the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance, the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

The price for each of the technically acceptable proposals will be evaluated for price reasonableness. The resulting award will be a firm fixed price contract. Offerors shall submit price in one lump sum amount.

AWARD.

The government will make an integrated past performance/price tradeoff assessment and award to the technically acceptable offeror determined to provide the best value to the Government.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE OF PARTNERSHIPS

Through this Request for Information (RFI), the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP - hereafter also referred to as “sponsor”) seeks one or more partners (hereafter referred to as “partners”) to assist in developing and delivering seminars, conferences, and trade shows (in conjunction with conference proceedings) or portions thereof – at no cost to the Government sponsor, GSA/OGP.  The ultimate objective of these partnerships is to provide high-quality events (e.g., seminars and conferences) that meet the sponsor’s educational and emerging as well as ongoing policy management needs - as well as enhance the effectiveness of and opportunities for communications between the Federal government and the business communities with which it interacts.  

OGP currently has at least one such partnership, and does not reimburse the  partner for any services rendered or expenses incurred.  In keeping with this scenario, the partners identified through this RFI will not be reimbursed by OGP for any services rendered or expenses incurred in conjunction with this RFI.  It is anticipated that the primary source of funding for the partner services and expenses will be afforded through the fees which each partner collects in conjunction with the events that this RFI covers.

Partner services and expenses may include - but are not limited to - event production and delivery, and related items and activities (e.g., session presenters, lodging, meals, meeting and/or exhibit space, audiovisual support, Internet access, signage, special networking events for participants).  The cost of such services and expenses may be recouped through revenues collected through - but not limited to - attendee registration, industry showcase sponsorships, and collaborative opportunities with other partners.

This no-cost (to the Government sponsor) funding model serves the interests of both parties.  The Government sponsor retains control of the event’s message and content, while the partner retains control of their revenues.  As with all the events and associated activities which this RFI covers – including the extent of the revenues collected – the Government sponsor is ultimately responsible for go/no-go decisions.  The no-cost mechanism specific to each individual event will be mutually agreed upon by the Government sponsor and the partner in writing at the onset of that event’s planning.
