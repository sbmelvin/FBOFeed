<DESC>This is the second modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 


QUESTION: Will the Government permit Contractor personnel to deploy to Iraq without a Secret Clearance?

ANSWER: The Government will allow Contractor personnel to begin the deployment process with a minimum of an interim Secret Clearance being granted.

QUESTION: What travel will be provided by the Government?

ANSWER: The Government will provide the initial transportation of a Contractor employee from CONUS to the area of operation (likely Kuwait City) and one return flight at the end of the contract or at the end of the employment of the employee.  The Government will provide transportation from Kuwait City to BIAP and between the several Iraqi airports.

QUESTION: What travel will be expensed by the winning Contractor?

ANSWER: The Contractor may seek reimbursement for employee travel between their home of record to the CONUS departure point at the beginning of their employment as well as travel from the CONUS arrival point at the end of their employment.  The Contractor may seek reimbursement for expense of employee travel for any other business travel directed by the Government falling under the definition of Temporary Duty.  Travel or other expenses not directly related to Government requirements are not reimbursable.  

QUESTION: Are services such as laundry or dry cleaning available?

ANSWER: Do not expect dry cleaning to be available.  Self service laundry is likely to be available.
