<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Engineering Directorate, is seeking to acquire engineering and technical management support services on a task order basis. The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis for a n Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract. The effort will be in support of engineering studies, management, and support for defense against chemical and biological attack, for deterrent capability against such attacks, for homeland defense, for Assembled Chemical Weapons Assembly, and for smoke and obscurants development and acquisition. The technical support will require engineering disciplines in chemical, computer, biochemical, electrical, mechanical and/or the life sciences. Additionally,  all related acquisition disciplines (e.g., logistics, packaging, fielding, quality, etc) will be required.  Some task orders may require the contractor to handle sensitive or hazardous items to include chemical surety material, toxins and toxoids, viruses , bacteria, acids, bases, and solvents. Known or suspected carcinogens may be involved in specific task orders. The contract may require work with chemical surety material both on-site and off-site. Performance of the contract will require a security clear ance of up to and including SECRET.  The provisions of FAR 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest will apply to certain requirements/individual task orders under this contract. Prospective offerors will be requested to submit an Organizati onal Conflict of Interest (OCI) avoidance plan with their proposal, which sets forth how the offeror intends to identify, avoid, or mitigate actual or potential conflicts. Where required by the nature of the effort described in the task order, work will be  performed on-site at ECBC, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, Bluegrass Army Depot, KY, and Pueblo Chemical Depot, AZ. It is anticipated that resulting contracts will have a five-year period of performance. The solicitation will be structured to allow for multi ple awards.  The government intends to award at least one contract to small business concerns, as appropriate, in each of two functional groups which will be identified in the solicitation.  The maximum quantity is anticipated to be $200,000,000, which wil l be shared among all awardees; however the likelihood of available funding to reach the maximum quantity is provided for information as follows:  Category A  ($2 million per year, $10 million total)  This effort is most likely to be funded.  It is based  on previous and highly probable work to be conducted in the ECBC Engineering Directorate; Category B  ($5 million per year, $25 million total)  Funding at this level is possible, highly dependent on world events; Category C  ($40 million per year, $200  million total)  This level of funding is a possibility but is a low priority and receipt of funding to support this level of effort is doubtful.  Estimated release date for RFP DAAD13-03-R-0003 is on or about 18 February 2003 with responses due within 45  days after release. A preproposal conference is expected to be held at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, within approximately two weeks after solicitation release.  A tour of the Engineering, Manufacturing and Test Facilities (approx one h our) is planned at this time.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered.  See Note 26.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., for an eighteen-month extension to contract NO1-LM-0-3522, "Creation of Bioethics Citations for NLM Search Systems."  The Kennedy Institute is responsible for the acquisition and indexing of bioethics-related books, journal articles, reports and other items not indexed in NLM search systems.  Because many of the publications are not totally bioethics-oriented, skill is needed to determine those publications that warrant inclusion in the systems.  This requires knowledge of the original Bioethicsline database's scope and coverage, trends and issues in the field of bioethics, and familiarity with NLM's software systems used to create database records.  Since 1974 the Kennedy Institute has successfully acquired and indexed references to bioethics material.  They also actively make recommendations for MeSH.  The Kennedy Institute owns the rights to the data produced under the BIOETHICSLINE database during the period 1974 through 1987.  In addition the Kennedy Institute keeps n file a hard copy of each indexed citation, which is required for the interlibrary loan program.  It has been determined that the Kennedy Institute is the only source with the necessary capabilities and expertise of adding and maintaining records for the bioethics subject area in the NLM search systems without substantive changes in the bioethics data elements, software, or retrieval systems and without duplication of effort.  The Kennedy Institute owns the rights to a substantial portion of the data produced making  them the only firm capable of fulfilling NLM's requirements without undue delays and duplication of effort.  During this eighteen-month extension the NLM will be conducting an evaluation to assess: 1) the breadth and quality of the bioethics literature that NLM has collected and supported, and 2) the indexing and cataloging coverage of bioethics literature produced and supported by NLM.  This evaluation will help determine whether changes or consolidation of these efforts are required which would be incorporated into the statement of work for any subsequent sole-source renewal. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI) - Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-4142.  TREATMENT FOR DISPOSITION OF INEEL HIGH RADIATION MIXED LOW-LEVEL DEBRIS. Contact Mr. Scott A. Drewes.  BBWI, a managing and operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), is seeking an expression of interest from firms to provide treatment of INEEL high radiation mixed low-level debris. Treatment facilities must be privately owned and operated outside of areas managed by DOE. Treated debris may be returned to the INEEL if a mechanism for disposal is not available.  Appropriate licenses and permits obtained at vendor expense must be in place prior to award of the contract(s).  The amount of waste for which treatment is sought under this announcement is approximately 240 cubic meters (8,500 cubic feet) to be treated in the April 2003 through September 2004 period. The debris to be treated is currently stored in approximately 147 containers comprised of drums, plastic bags, wooden boxes, and metal containers and range in size from 1 cubic foot to 142 cubic feet.  The debris includes tools, piping, equipment, gaskets, valves, rags, concrete, cobbles, hoses, HEPA filters, metal, plastic, wood, and personal protective equipment.  The debris contains a hazardous component subject to regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and carries a multitude of EPA waste codes.  The radioactive component of the subject waste is classified as low-level radioactive material.  The radioactive component is not classified as transuranic (i.e., alpha emitting radionuclides with an atomic number greater than 92, half life greater than 20 years, in concentrations greater than 100 nanocuries per gram) or high level waste.  Radiation dose rates at contact with the waste containers range from < 0.1 mrem/hr to 13,000 mrem/hr.  Radiation dose rates at one meter from the waste containers range from < 0.1 mrem/hr to 500 mrem/hr.  Services to be contracted include transporting the debris from the INEEL to the treatment facility, performing any necessary sorting and sizing of debris required prior to treatment, treating the waste to meet applicable regulatory standards and requirements, any interim storage at the treatment facility, and transporting and disposing of the treated debris and any residuals in a permitted and licensed facility if available.  The treated debris must meet all regulatory and other applicable requirements for disposal.  Development of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and treatment/disposal of waste under the contract(s) will be contingent on availability of necessary funding.  The RFP, if developed, will include detailed waste stream information.  Qualified respondents must provide two printed copies of the following information: company name, address, point of contact, email, phone/fax numbers, including sub-tiers and/or teaming partners, e.g., transportation companies, and a concise summary report that describes the capabilities of the respondent and its sub-tier and/or teaming partners, and a listing of all similar recent activities complete with reference names and telephone numbers, and copies of licenses and permits held, including NRC and state license agreements for radioactive materials and RCRA permits.  Respondents who provide insufficient information will not be considered further.  The expression of interest is totally separate from all other solicitations involving facilities or services for the treatment of INEEL mixed low-level waste (MLLW).  Firms interested in responding should forward the requisite information to:  Mr. Scott A. Drewes, Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC, P.O. Box 1625, Mail Stop 4142, Idaho Falls, ID  83415-4142.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is conducting a national building and fire safety investigation of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.  More information about NIST's investigation may be found at the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov.  NIST intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Leslie E. Roberson Associates (LERA) to provide services under Project 2 (Baseline Structural Performance and Aircraft Impact Damage Analysis).  Specific information for Project 2, may be found by following this link to the NIST Web site http://wtc.nist.gov/media/WTCplan_new.htm#proj2.  The project team from LERA includes the engineer of record for the design of the WTC towers, the engineer of record for the repairs made after the 1993 bombing, the engineer(s) of record for modifications based on tenant alterations and ongoing technical work, and the engineer(s) of record for the structural integrity inspections of the towers.  The LERA team has unique knowledge of the design construction, and intended behavior of the towers gained from having had the structural engineering responsibility from the inception of project planning through its life cycle to September 11, 2001; a span of about 38 years.  No other individual or team possesses similar expertise or experience. 

The objectives of this requirement are to: 
(1)	develop databases for the structural components of WTC 1 and 2, 
(2)	use the databases to develop baseline structural models of each of the two towers, and 
(3) perform linear static, structural analyses to establish the baseline performance of each of the two towers under gravity and wind loads.

The contractor shall provide the labor and materials necessary to perform the following three tasks:
(1)	Development of structural databases -- The contractor shall develop databases of all primary structural elements for all 110 stories and the 6 basement levels (within the footprint of the towers) of towers 1 and 2.  The structural databases shall be developed in consultation with NIST and shall be delivered in the form of electronic spreadsheets.  The databases will be used by NIST for the development of structural models for the various analytical phases of the investigation (including those that are part of this solicitation).  The databases shall be developed on the basis of the structural drawings of the towers including modifications made after construction and as a result of the 1993 bombing.  The databases shall include all structural elements needed for development of the baseline structural models in Task 2.

(2)	Development of structural models -- The contractor shall use the structural databases developed in Task 1 to develop linear, finite element structural models of WTC 1 and 2.  The models shall be developed using SAP2000 software, and shall include:
i)	   Models A:  Detailed linear elastic, three-dimensional models of 1/4 floor system of (1) a typical truss floor system between the 80th and 100th floor, and (2) a mechanical floor (girder system).  The models will include all structural members of the floor system such as primary trusses and girders, secondary trusses and beams, composite concrete slabs, spandrel beams, and diagonal brace members (straps) as well as structural dampers.  The contractor shall use these models to establish the baseline performance of the floor systems under gravity loads; estimate the in-plane stiffness of the floor diaphragms and to develop simplified models for the floor system that accurately capture the behavior of the floor diaphragms; and to develop similar models for floors 89 to 103 of WTC 1 and floors 74 to 88 of WTC2 that will be used by NIST for other analytical phases of the investigation.
ii)	Models B:  Linear elastic, three-dimensional models of the 110-story structure and basement floors of each of the two towers.  The models will include all primary structural elements including (but not limited to) exterior columns, interior columns, columns and bracings in basement floors, spandrel beams, hat trusses, simplified models for floor systems as developed from models A, and connections critical to the behavior of the structures.  The models will be used to establish the baseline performance of each of the two towers under gravity and wind loads.  The contractor shall conduct preliminary, "small-scale" analyses to verify the validity of the various element types used in the development of models for components and connections (e.g. sub-assemblies of pre-fabricated exterior column elements with connections between columns and between spandrel beams).  The contractor shall conduct an eigenvalue analysis to compare the calculated natural frequencies against frequencies measured in the original structures.

3)	Baseline performance analysis -- The contractor shall use the structural models developed in Task 2 to conduct linear static, structural analyses of each of the two towers to establish their baseline performance.  The towers shall be analyzed under the following loads:
i)	Gravity loads:  The contractor shall analyze models A and B   under gravity loads and consider the following cases: (1) dead loads, (2) live loads used in the original design of the towers, and (3) live loads according to either current New York City building code or current ASCE 7 standard (to be selected).
ii)	Lateral wind loads:  The contractor shall analyze models B under wind loads and consider the following cases: (1) wind loads used for the original design of the towers, and (2) wind loads based on currently available aerodynamic information (from three sets of wind tunnel tests, including the tests conducted during the design stage and two sets of tests conducted recently by private sector consultants) and on extreme climatological information from available data and applicable standards.  The information from wind loads for case (2) will be supplied by NIST.

The Government anticipates the award of a commercial firm-fixed price purchase order on or about February 3, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the services of a contractor to provide INTERNATIONAL MAIL PRE-SORT CONSOLIDATION SERVICES.  The United States Postal Service (USPS) offers significant discounts on the price of sending international mail if that mail is presorted to the destination country before it is entered into the postal system.  The use of a mail consolidator to sort the mail is essential in the continuing effort to reduce the IRS mail costs.  It is extremely important to distinguish between an INTERNATIONAL MAIL CONSOLIDATOR and an INTERNATIONAL REMAILER.  An international mail consolidator sorts the mail according to USPS specifications and enters the mail in the USPS system.  Therefore the IRS is paying postage to an American postal system and receives all of the protections and quality of that service.  An international remailer sorts the mail and enters it into the postal service of a foreign country to postmark and mail.  While postal rates are sometimes less expensive in the country from where the mail is sent, service has been shown to be less reliable and the IRS would paying a foreign mail system.  Additionally, all international mail must have a return address of the country from which it is mailed.  For example, if a remailer puts the mail into the Panamanian postal system, the mail must have a Panama return address in order to be delivered.  This would preclude the use of a remailer as all IRS mail to be processed under this contract has a United States return address.  The successful vendor selected to fulfill the requirements of a contract awarded from this solicitation shall be designated a PRE-QUALIFIED WHOLESALER, as outlined by the USPS Pre-qualified Wholesaler Program.  This program allows a unique working agreement between the USPS and the consolidator so that both parties, as well as any customers, benefit from a work sharing and volume pricing arrangement.  The standards that the wholesaler must meet to gain this designation guarantee that the contractor is well versed in this type of operation and will be able to fully meet all requirements of the contract.  Each potential offeror submitting a proposal must show proof of such designation by the USPS.  A Request for Quotations (RFQ), TIRNO-03-Q-00001 will be issued on or about OCTOBER 16, 2002.  Offers in response to the RFQ are due not later than 3:00 PM, Monday, November 4, 2002, at the address shown above.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of the RFQ from the IRS Procurement website: http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov/.  No telephone requests will be honored.  Numbered Note #1 - 100% small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>INVITATION FOR BIDS USING TWO-STEP SEALED BID PROCESS.
This is a follow to the pre-solicitation notice issued on 18 November 2002 for the function cited for which a site-visit was held at the end of October 2002 at 14th and C Streets, for the purpose of discussing and demonstrating the Accounts Payable solicitation as a Two Step Sealed Bid process.  On the basis of resounding show of 8A businesses the Bureau of Engraving & Printing has set this action aside as a competitive 8A set-aside and plans on issuing a Two-Step IFB under FAR Part 14 on or about 30 January.  The BEP Accounts Payable function is located in Washington, D.C.  This action is a follow to an OMB Circular A-76 Streamlined process under the provisions of the Circular and OMB Revised Supplemental Handbook issued 1996.  Because this function is regularly performed in the commercial workplace and many 8A firms have expressed interest, the contemplated contract shall be a Firm Fixed Price with an Award Fee annual dollar amount to be earned on the basis of subjective judgment.  A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the above services performed by Government personnel to contractor performance is simultaneously being done. A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by a factor equal to or greater than ten percent of the Government personnel cost. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services shall have Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified even though this is a streamlined competition of 10 or fewer positions. The successful bidder shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the Accounts Payable services described in the PWS, QASP, and PRS to be provided electronically as part of the solicitation posted at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Due to the type of work conducted at the BEP it is required that contractor?s personnel be United States citizens, further each employee must be able to pass and obtain a full background clearance from the BEP as they will be working with very sensitive information. The term of the contract consists of an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months. A performance-based service contract will result.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541219 size standard - $7,000,000.00. This requirement will use a  Two-Step Sealed Bid  Selection process, (refer to Solicitation Sections L and M.) and is reserved for companies in the Small Business Administration?s 8(a) Program using full and open competition. The solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 30 January 30, 2003

<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this SECOND NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT (under OMB Circular A-76) at Washington, DC and Fort Worth. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study, this study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery (the function), complies with the current procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the Commercial Activities program and Revised Supplemental Handbook. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed IF SOURCES CAN BE FOUND, other than SICPA.  To date, the only source in the United States that has come forth is SICPA.  If no other firms come forth other than SICPA, competition is considered to be non-attainable, and thus the potential CA study may be cancelled in accordance with FAR Part 7.303.  If sources are found, a solicitation may be issued later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing BEP is earnestly seeking any and all qualified ink making and roller recovery capable vendors nationwide that have the technical capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with the functional work of Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations. 

A statement of work is not yet completed, but is expected in the next several months.  In the meantime, the BEP is SEEKING ALL SOURCES for Ink Manufacturing at Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX. The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses.  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing laboratory staffed with full-time chemists is maintained in the section to perform certification tests on all ink batches.  Inks must pass the respective tests before they can be used in currency presses.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks.  Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that ANY VENDOR in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER at the email or by mail herrein. Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least two main (2) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE UNDER A76, SEEKING SOURCES IAW FAR PART 7.303.  NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  No actions will be taken until 30 separate notices over 90 days has occurred. 

IF AT THE END OF NINETY (90) DAYS, THE BEP CANNOT SECURE AT LEAST TWO INDEPENDENT SOURCES FROM COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY, WE MAY CANCEL ANY POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE GOVERNMENT VERSUS PRIVATE INDUSTRY COMPETION DUE TO NO SOURCES AVAILABLE AND COMPETITION NOT POSSIBLE.

<DESC>ATTENTION UNRESTRICTED FIRMS.  This proposed contract is unrestricted.  Responses are being accepted from all firms.  Firm Fixed Price Contract.  Provide for purchase of Emission Reduction Credits (ERC's) to offset a 120 ton/yr emission increase of Nitrous Oxide (NOx).  This can be accomplished through  the purchase of 204 tons/yr of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) ERC's or a combination of NOx and VOC credits that meet the requirement.   

Successful offeror will be based on the lowest price that meet the following minimum requirements:

(1) Transfer to the Navy the proposed tons per year of Air Pollution Emission Reduction Credits (ERC's) for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's)  or a combination of credits that meet the stated requirement that are currently banked with the PA Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) pursuant to 25PA Code 127.206-208.  The ERC's must be registered in the PADEP Registry  and shall be determined by the PADEP to be surplus, permanent, quantified and federally enforceable reductions in emissions.  In addition to the above paragraph, the ERC's shall be otherwise fully recognized by appropriate federal, state and local authorities as legally valid for use as permanent emissions offsets to obtain necessary permits under all applicable laws pertaining to the control and abatement of air pollution.  Such laws include but are not limited to legal requirements applicable to "major sources" or "major modifications" of sources of air pollutants.  NOTE:  The contractor, at time of proposal submission, is warranting the validity of all ERC's in accordance with the requirements of the warranty language set forth in the Invitation for Bid (IFB). Transfer of banked emission reductions shall be made pursuant to 25PA Code 127.208 and banked ERC's shall be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance permitted by the state of PA.  The contractor shall provide evidence to the Government that the PADEP has been informed, in writing, of the transfer and that the transfer has been recorded in the Banking Registry.  The transaction shall be complete upon the Navy's receipt of confirmation of transferred ERC's from the PADEP.  The contractor shall be responsible for all banking application fees and banked emission transfer application fees and must be able to meet required delivery date and FOB terms.  

(2)  The official transfer process for the ERC's shall be initiated with the PADEP within ten (10) days and shall be delivered (i.e. transfer complete) no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after contract award, exclusive of delays solely attributed to the Navy.  Registration of the ERC's in the registry system will constitute certification.  All certificates shall be registered to USN, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Ship Service Engineering Station, Philadelphia, PA.  and delivered to EFANE, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Attn: Mark Donato at 10 Industrial Highway, MS #82, Lester, PA 19113-2090.

Add the following paragraph (d) to SECTION C, 1:  (d)  Proposed cost model technical efforts shall be subject to the following general constraints, where appropriate:  
(1)	The cost model effort is a pervasive technology across the other Focus Areas (Versatile
  Core, Intelligent Engine and Durability), and efforts proposed shall cover one or more of   these general areas:  Development Cost, Production Cost, Maintenance Cost.  
(2)	The cost models must be based on DoD-approved practices for economic and cost analysis and contain reasonable, consistent, and well-documented assumptions and groundrules.
(3)  The cost models must be able to provide estimates of cost and identify cost drivers.
(4)  The cost models must have the capability to vary base-year dollars.
(5)  The cost models must be non-proprietary and generally available to all VAATE Contractors    for use in the VAATE program.
(6)  The cost models must address all Government Notional Baseline Engines in all Engine Classes, as well as the advanced technology Propulsion Systems that meet the VAATE CCI Goal.
(7)  The cost model proposals must contain documentation supporting the intent to enter into either an Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) or subcontracting effort with the VAATE Weapon Systems and Engine contractors for model validation purposes and for support of the cost model development.
(8)  The cost models must have the ability to perform: 
a. cost analysis to the component and sub-assembly level; 
b. direct cost comparisons of technology alternatives; 
c. direct cost comparisons of baseline engine versus VAATE I and II production configuration;
d. ?What-if? trades; 
e. sensitivity analysis; and 
f.  business case analysis for legacy, existing, and future systems.
Add the following paragraph (6) to Section E,  as follows:  6.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-N00019-03-P7-ZD055
<RESPDATE>022803
<ARCHDATE>03152003
<CONTACT>Karen Collier, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-6727, Fax 301-757-6752, Email collierks@navair.navy.mil - Pam Gray, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 757-6726, Fax 301-757-6753, Email graypk@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD, PMA-202C, is requesting information from potential sources which would be helpful in defining the level of effort required to develop a parachute canopy release assembly with improved performance characteristics.   The desired release assembly would include features to allow ease of manual operation while under tension loads, an automatic release capability that would be activated upon immersion in either salt water (threshold) or fresh water (goal), and reduced size to minimize the potential affects of helmet slap during an ejection. Ideally, the automatic release feature would be integral to the canopy release vice requiring a separate automatic release unit.  A Built-In-Test (BIT) capability is also a desired feature and the new release shall be a common device that can be used by both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force.  

Currently, the U.S. Navy utilizes the Parachute Harness Sensing Release Unit that is comprised of a Sea Water Activated Release System (SEAWARS) attached to the canopy release assemblies   the seat mounted parachute riser assemblies.   The Parachute Harness Sensing Release Unit provides a backup automatic mode of separating the parachute from the crewmember within 2 seconds after water immersion (manually activating the canopy release assembly is the primary mode of separating the parachute). The U.S. Air Force utilizes the Universal Water Activated Release System (UWARS) that is also a sea water activated release system designed for in-line attachment to the three different types of canopy release assemblies utilized on the crewmember's restraint harness. These different types of release systems used by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force are costly to procure, support, and maintain. 

In an effort to reduce these support costs, the U.S. Government  is exploring potential efforts to evaluate a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) or mature technology that will lead to the qualification of a new, common parachute canopy release assembly that will be compatible with the parachute riser assemblies and personnel restraint harnesses of both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. The purpose of this request is to define the scope of potential efforts and assist in the preparation of detailed requirements. To limit the range of technologies to consider, respondents may assume any potential program  for this effort, including qualification, would be required to be completed within 3 years of initiation. The parachute assemblies and restraint harnesses with which the improved parachute canopy release assembly must be compatible include but are not limited to the following: U.S. Navy: NES-12 Parachute Assembly; NES-16 Parachute Assembly; NES-14 Parachute Assembly; NES-25 Parachute Assembly;  A/P22P-21 Parachute Assembly; A/P28S-28/30/31 Parachute 
Assemblies; A/P28S-24 Parachute Assembly; A/P28S-32(v) Parachute Assembly; PCU-56/P-series Restraint Harnesses; U.S. Air Force:
ACES-II Parachute Assembly; BA-18 Parachute Assembly; BA-21 Parachute Assembly; BA-22 Parachute Assembly; BA-25 Parachute Assembly; BA-27 Parachute Assembly; B-20 Parachute Assembly; C-12 Parachute Assembly; PCU-15/P Restraint Harness; PCU-16/P Restraint Harness; JPATS Parachute Assembly.  The specific information requested to be provided is as follows:

1. Overview of off-the-shelf designs for an improved parachute canopy release assembly that could be adapted to interface with the above parachute assemblies and restraint harnesses, a description of its shape including size and weight, a description of its operation, its activation mechanism, the force required to manually release the assembly for a given riser tension, features that would preclude inadvertent automatic operation, the time required to automatically activate upon water immersion, the maturity level of the design, the testing conducted to verify its operation, extent of testing recommended to qualify proposed design for use by both services and a description of its uses elsewhere, if applicable.   

2. A description of technologies available which could be developed to produce an improved parachute canopy release assembly in the event off-the-shelf designs cannot be adapted. 

3. A description of performance, reliability, maintainability, and compatibility improvements. Specifically, the integral nature of the proposed device as well as the incorporation of a BIT capability should be addressed.  

4. Anticipated modifications to the restraint harnesses/parachute risers and any special support equipment required to accommodate the new release.

5. Risk areas related to technical requirements outlined in this announcement with specific input related to the fresh water operation requirement.

6. Specific recommendations for us to consider for inclusion in any subsequent requirements document.

7. Whether the schedule is reasonable for the effort outlined. 

8. Other innovative suggestions to consider; i.e., automatic ground impact release system.

9. Address whether data rights would be available to the Government.
  
Companies responding to this request should provide responses to Ms. Karen Collier, NAVAIRSYSCOM, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670, or by E-mail, CollierKS@navair.navy.mil.  Please address all technical inquiries to F. Richards Code 461300D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, (760) 939-1454.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this request MUST be marked as such on each page.  This Request for Information (RFI) does not in any way constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and, as such, is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for information/items solicited.  Data, drawings and other materials submitted will not be returned.  To be of maximum benefit to the program, responses must be received by 28 February 2003.

Responses to this sources sought an nouncement are not adequate responses to a future solicitation announcement.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the response to this announcement.  This is not a request for proposal and does not obligate  the government to award any contract. This notice is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Please note that this office has not yet made a decision as to whether this procurement will be performed and it reserves the right to determine the appropriate method of procuring the above services based upon its analysis and evaluation of the responses to this synopsis. Questions: 1.	Have you performed this type contract?  (private industry or government) 2.	Have you heard of this initiative for Army? 3.	Do you know about the Navy RFP at Charles Naval Weapons Complex? 4.	In your opinion, would the costs to prepare a proposal impact the decision to consider submitting a proposal? 5.	Do you know about the underwriters indemnification policy?  Opinions? 6.	How do you envision working this type of contract with regulators?  (Fed, State, Other) 7.  	What is your opinion as to the contractor being responsible to pay regulatory fines? 8.	Are there new technologies currently available which make this a more viable contracting tool for Ordnance and Explosive (OE) Response Actions, including Chemical Warfare Materiel? 9.	If the site includes Chemical Warfare Materiel, would this impact your insurance ability to perform?  If yes, how?   10.	Do you have an opinion about  bundling one or more potential sites into one solicitation and contract? 11.	Opinions about contract clauses?  In your opinion, do you think T for C, Liquidated Damages, Differing Site Conditions, Changes, etc. should be in the type of solicitation? 12.	RFP vs. 2-Step IFB.  Which would be a better tool in your opinion? 13.	Do you see transition from other contracting mechanisms to GFPR at Ordnance sites as a problem? 14.  	How do you envision payments to take place?  Milestones vs. progress payments?  How would you define progress 15. 	Do you see Governmental QA/QC occurring like other contracts? 16.	Are you prepared to handle PAO issues? 17.	Is this GFPR Initiative a good idea? 18. 	What suggested changes or other comments/insights would you add to the Governments intended approach which would more closely mirror private industry? Summary:   The Ordnance & Explosives response actions are extremely complex, as well as the nature of this concept as being unique.  Therefore, this office is soliciting the OE contracting and insurance community for the viability of this proposed concept to conduct this type of proposed contract.

<CONTACT>Susan Donbroski, Contract Specialist, Phone 916-643-0290, Fax 916-643-4032, Email donbroski@tasa-exchange.army.mil - Susan Donbroski, Contract Specialist, Phone 916-643-0290, Fax 916-643-4032, Email donbroski@tasa-exchange.army.mil
<DESC>The Naval Media Center Broadcasting Department is seeking  sources to provide technologies that have the potential to replace 8 millimeter videotape mastering, duplication, and playback systems in use today in the present generation Shipboard Information, Training, and Entertainment (SITE) systems. SITE systems are installed aboard US Navy ships, submarines and some Military Sealift Command ships. Technologies should provide state-of-the-art solution(s) capable of 10 or more years of service life and must provide for content encoding and encryption, media duplication and distribution, and two separate playback functions ? stand-alone and server-based. It is essential that both playback solutions share a common media format and content security system(s) including both content decryption and key management.  Ideal technologies will dramatically simplify workflow and reduce manpower requirements in all phases of content acquisition, duplication, distribution, and playback. This is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations.
     The state-of-the-art has advanced considerably since the present generation SITE design and NMC is now faced with a videotape format that will become extinct within two to four years, and has already begun the inevitable upward growth in life cycle maintenance, replacement, and operating costs.  Programming for use in SITE systems consists of four types:  theatrical movies, which are procured from the commercial movie industry by Naval Motion Picture Service (NMPS); time sensitive content supplied by NMC owned and operated videotape duplication facilities (DUPFACs);  non-time sensitive content from commercial duplicators who distribute programming to ships in a circuited fashion;  and training materials, which are supplied from a number of commercial and military sources, typically, on VHS format videotape.  NMC DUPFACs are equipped to receive programming from the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) satellite network.  Once duplicated on 8 mm videotape, shipments of programming are transported to U.S. Navy ships by military shipping channels. Ships receiving DUPFAC service often receive U.S. domestic television programs within one or two days after being aired over AFRTS.  NMC faces the challenge of identifying technologies that can provide improved video playback quality, a clear migration path away from 8 mm videotape, sustainable technologies with a clear 10 year life cycle, and the capability to distribute 15 full length movies on a single piece of media.  If you or your organization is involved in the areas of television program encoding, encryption, file storage, decoding, decrypting, public/private key management, and video playback technologies or otherwise believe that you have the capabilities that can benefit NMCs SITE program as it is further described below, NMC is requesting such information. Please mail, e-mail, or fax your response to this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice to the address listed below by February 18, 2003.

     NMC desires to take advantage of digital technologies that provide advantages in terms of end-to-end signal quality, file storage, faster than real time file transfer rates, and that provide stand-alone playback functionality. Standalone playback devices must support two major functions ? backup playback for video server equipped SITE systems, and primary playback for SITE systems without video servers. It is anticipated that stand-alone playback devices will also be used in small theatre applications at U.S. Navy land-based facilities.  Stand-alone playback devices must present users with typical VCR or DVD control features such as Play, Rewind, Fast Forward, Pause, and Stop. In addition, they must provide content navigation controls to allow a user to select  a piece of content without having to sequentially Fast Forward or Rewind through unwanted content.  Stand-alone playback devices must have front panel and optionally hand-held remote control for all functions.
     Ideal technologies must employ a system architecture that remains in the digital (MPEG) domain from the source origination completely through all satellite, DUPFAC and shipboard systems. NMC is interested in technologies that would enable recording pre-encoded content extracted from multiple-program MPEG transport stream directly to a video server hard drive. Once stored, single program elements are to be combined with metadata, low bandwidth thumbnails, and other utility (non-media) files to form a pre-duplication master. Once a master is created, acceptable technologies must allow duplication of a minimum of 30 copies in a time span not to exceed one hour.
     Content encryption and key management are critical elements of this workflow and must be included in any acceptable responses to this RFI/SSN.  Acceptable responses must include technologies that are capable of protecting intellectual property from unauthorized access. Acceptable security technologies will have minimal impact on shipboard and small theatre users and must include provisions to allow owners of intellectual property to determine the level of protection required, and if a particular implementation of a security protocol offered by respondents to this RFI/SSN is acceptable.  Only those technologies capable of meeting the security requirements of the entertainment, movie, broadcast, and cable television industries will be acceptable to NMC.
     SITE system video servers must be capable of four output channels (video and audio) and provide long term storage of up to 800 full-length movies.  Vendors should use an MPEG-2 encode rate of 4.0 Mbps as a reference to determine storage requirements. In addition to movie storage, vendors should also consider other forms of content likely to be stored in shipboard video servers. These include, but are not limited to, shipboard local production, public service announcements also known as ?command information, 20-hours per week of commercially duplicated content, and content supplied to most ships from NMC DUPFACs. NMC DUPFACs will typically supply ships with a minimum of 16 hours of programming per day designed to feed two television channels with eight hours each.
     A fully automated workflow for both duplication and shipboard playback functions will be required. It is desired that a centralized system be devised to allow multiple duplication facilities to master and distribute the same product to all ships worldwide. The common output product from duplication facilities would consist of a minimum of 16 hours of programming and a playlist file. The playlist file is envisioned to contain sufficient data to allow a simple automation system, perhaps included within the video server?s operating system, to automatically play back four channels of programming. NMC envisions two output channels dedicated to DUPFAC and other NMC programming, and two output channels dedicated to movies.
     NMC suspects that most solutions will require significant interface of with computers and computer networks.  NMC desires to take full advantage of programmable features offered by computers by providing the SITE system with capabilities that are not available today. Examples of these capabilities include, but are by no means limited to administrator function(s) whereby the ability to control, program, and operate the video playback subsystem from a distance (i.e., via Local Area Network) is provided to SITE system managers/administrators; remote diagnostics giving NMC owned and operated depot level repair facilities the ability to examine, diagnose, and repair shipboard systems without having to physically deploy technical staff; and integrated management and therefore automation of subsystems such as, for example, the duplication functions.  SNMP or control functions provided via Ethernet shall not provide access to encrypted files or material.
     NMC is interested in off-the-shelf technologies that can provide a significant improvement in the density of programming hours per unit of media; technologies that are capable of full automation yet can also be fully manipulated by shipboard operators; technologies that will facilitate ?faster than real time? transfer of programming between integral parts of a playback system; and technologies that are scalable in terms numbers of channels, drives, or both, and in terms of quality of playback (probably controlled at the encoding (recording) process).  Ideal technologies will be based on open architecture systems that are also compliant with commercial broadcast standards such as MPEG-2 or later.

Severe space limitations exist with all SITE systems and no expansion rack space is planned or desired.  All SITE systems use 19-inch wide, EIA standard equipment racks with a depth of 24 inches.

Responses must include:

1. Point of contact (company name, POC name, phone and fax numbers, e-mail) who is familiar with your company?s activities.

2. Provide a brief description of your past, present, and future capabilities, activities, and programs related to broadcast automation and control systems, encoding and
storage technologies, encryption and content security technologies, and decoding and playback technologies.

3. Provide information on how the technologies available from your company can support the capabilities outlined.

4. Provide information on your company?s projection of long term availability of product(s) that might support the capabilities outlined.

5. Provide information on your company?s past experience with deployment and implementation of technologies, lessons learned, merits and shortfalls, and unmet needs.

6. Indicate potential interest in being considered in NMC?s assessment of technologies as described.

     Depending on the responses, NMC may narrow the scope of focus and release modifications to this RFI/SSN. NMC intends to conduct an assessment of all technologies within the narrowed scope if necessary. All assessments will include three parts:

(1) a functional assessment based on materials submitted and presentations by vendors;

(2) a technical assessment lasting approximately five (5) working days based on a live demonstration of video playback technologies using programming material supplied by NMC, and hands-on experience by potential SITE system operators;

and

(3) a technical and cost assessment by NMC based on data provided by the vendor.

Please send your responses to Mr. Jim Kuhrt by e-mail to

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  

Items being consider are: Rochester Midland Envirocare Products 
(7930-00-NIB-0253, Carpet & Upholstery Cleaner); (7930-00-NIB-0254, Food Service Cleaner); (7930-00-NIB-0255, Glass Cleaner); (7930-00-NIB-0256, Hand Soap); (7930-00-NIB-0257, LiquiBac); (7930-00-NIB-0258, Low Foam All Purpose Cleaner); (7930-00-NIB-0259, Neutral Disinfectant); (7930-00-NIB-0260, Tough Job); and (7930-00-NIB-0261, Washroom & Fixture Cleaner).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Speical Notice - Sole Source Modification to Rhein Main BMC Contract
<DESC>Rhein Main Base Maintenance Contract (RMBMC), Frankfurt, Germany:  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government intends to issue a modification to the current contract F61521-99-C-5002 for the RMBMC, written with Pacific Architect & Engineering (PAE) Inc, Los Angeles, CA, for a 15 months only contract extension from 1 Oct 04 thru 31 Dec 05, for continued RMBMC support services.   Current contract with PAE expires 30 Sep 04 and comprises contractor provided operation and maintenance services, and contingency support services including Program Management and other multi-functional requirements, the largest workload being Civil Engineering. At this time, it is projected that all air operations will cease at RMAB on 30 Sep 05 and in the last calendar year quarter ending 31 Dec 05, the final base closure will take place and the facilities will be turned over to the Federal Republic of Germany.  There is no current indication that the mission will require Rhein Main AB to remain open beyond 31 Dec 05.  This action is considered necessary to mitigate mission disruption and avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the government?s requirements and in the interests of cost effectiveness, by avoiding substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.    For information purposes, no logistics support shall be provided under this contract. (No ID card privileges)
All interested and responsible sources may submit a response to the below POCs not later than 14 Feb 03 which, if timely received, will be considered.

OPIC provides political risk insurance and loans to help U.S. businesses of all sizes invest and compete in over 140 emerging markets worldwide.  OPIC accomplishes its mission by assisting U.S. investors through four principal activities: 1) insuring investments overseas against a broad range of political risks; 2) financing businesses overseas through loans and loan guaranties; 3) financing private investment funds that provide equity to businesses overseas; and 4) advocating the interests of the American business community overseas by restricting assistance in countries that do not meet human and workers rights, and environmental requirements.
	 
In fulfilling the Corporate mission, we create, receive, disseminate and maintain large quantities of information.  Much of this textual information involves insurance, financial, and administrative documentation that include classified, sensitive, and vital business data.  OPIC primarily operates in a paper-based environment.

Information Resources Management (IRM) under the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) has overall responsibility for the collection, storage, retrieval, dissemination, and destruction of OPIC records.  OPIC has an assortment of program-specific applications and systems to support almost 300 end users with automated business processes.  OPIC needs an integrated system that supports an environment that generates, collects, stores, disseminates, retrieves and destroys information and records electronically.  The system will allow OPIC, our customers, and other stakeholders to communicate and conduct business electronically versus hardcopy paper transactions.  OPIC requires the development and deployment of an electronic document and records management system (EDRMS) that will support its current and future business needs and workflow processes.

<CONTACT>Valda Murfree-Fleming, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-707-0468, Fax 202-707-8611, Email vmur@loc.gov
<DESC>The Library of Congress intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Daisy Consortium as follows:

C.  Description/Specifications/Work Statement

C.1 Background

The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) led a group of international partners to develop the American National Standard ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 Specifications for the Digital Talking Book (Z39.86).  This standard is beginning to be used in the United States and abroad and is expected to be widely adopted by libraries for the blind around the world.  The standard designates NLS as the maintenance agency responsible for its upkeep, and an NLS staff member is the current chair of the advisory committee for the standard.  Therefore, NLS has a special responsibility for ensuring that the standard is supported.

A variety of specialized software tools are required to produce digital talking books (DTBs) in accordance with Z39.86.  Some of these tools will be produced by for-profit firms for sale to DTB-producing agencies.  One tool, however, must be developed and maintained by the community of agencies who developed and support Z39.86.  That tool is a validator, a software suite running on a personal computer, which checks a finished DTB against the requirements set by the standard.  This validation tool must be under the control of the community using the standard, so that it is developed and maintained in a fair and open manner that is not prejudicial for or against any agency or firm operating in the Z39.86 realm.

C.2 Scope of Work

The contractor shall develop a software suite (called the Z39.86 DTB Validator) for testing the compliance of digital talking books with ANSI/NISO  Z39.86-2002.

C.3 Work Statement/Tasks to be Performed

C.3.1 High Level Requirements and Objectives

C.3.1.1 Functionality Objectives
The contractor shall develop a Z39.86 DTB Validator which shall perform a series of structural, syntactic and relational tests based on the requirements of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 and associated specifications.  All tests that have been run and have failed shall be identified by the validator, thus providing the user with data to detect non-conformant DTBs, and assist in the repair of the anomaly.  The validator developed under this contract shall only test for conformance of Type 1 (audioOnly) and Type 2 (audioNCX) books, as defined in section 13 of ANSI/NISO Z30.86-2002. Later versions of the validator will test conformance of other DTB types.

C.3.1.2 Design objectives
The contractor shall design the validator in accordance with the following objectives:
	1. The Z39.86 DTB Validator should be designed with longevity and simple maintenance in mind. 
	2. The design should allow for logical and scope extensions over time with minimal effort. 
	3. The design should allow for easy customization and adaptation, and specifically provide the ability to append local/agency-specific/content-specific tests 
	4. The design should make use of standardized and non-proprietary programming languages, processors and methods to the largest extent possible. 

C.3.1.3 Validator Components 
The validator shall consist of the following components:
1. Test Map 
A Test Map, which is a document that identifies all tests performed by the validator. The Test Map shall be machine-readable and human-readable, and each test therein must be clearly and unambiguously identified and explained. 
2. Test Performing Objects 
A set of Test Performing Objects, such as XML DTDs, RELAX NG schemas, XSLT documents, and computer code classes. These objects are the core of the validator and perform the tests that determine the validity of a DTB.  These are referenced by the test map regarding unique identification and purpose/test scope. 
3. Sample Implementation 
A Sample Implementation that uses the Test Map and the Test Performing Objects to form an application.  This application presents an interface to the user that allows them to select the target of the test, the tests to be performed, and the output format desired, and to initiate the tests.
4. Documentation 
Documentation for the Test Map, the Test Performing Objects and the Sample Implementation.  This documentation allows those responsible for maintaining the validator to more easily correct bugs, implement enhancements, etc. 

C.3.1.4 User Group Requirements
The Test Map and the Test Performing Objects shall be designed so that they provide a functionality that meets the needs and requirements of the following user groups. An implementation may choose to focus on a subset of them.

Content producers. Organizations creating DTBs need a tool for quality control purposes. For these users, the tool should provide clear, non-technical reports of what is wrong with a DTB and, perhaps, how it might be repaired. 
Distribution environments. Organizations that distribute DTBs need a tool to certify that the product to be delivered is fully functional, and to effectively diagnose DTBs that are identified by users as defective. 
Production tool developers. Companies developing systems whose output is DTBs need a validation tool in order to verify that their systems function properly. For these users, the tool should provide clear, technical reports of what is wrong with a DTB, with as much detail as possible (such as file names, line numbers, markup element IDs, etc.). 
Playback system developers. Companies developing playback systems for DTBs need a validation tool in order to verify the validity of content used during debugging and testing. These users have similar needs to those of production tool developers. 
Conformance testing. Conformance testing agencies such as the DAISY OK team need a validation tool in order to complete the work of conformance testing for production tools, as well as to validate test content used in conformance testing of playback systems. For this purpose, the tool should generate clear, detailed reports, and should reference the appropriate specification sections for reference.

C.3.2 Sample Implementation Design Requirements

C.3.2.1 Input Requirements
The Sample Implementation shall as one session support:
	?	validation of a single-volume DTB 
	?	validation of a multi-volume DTB 
	?	validation of one single-content data set member 
	?	validation of a multi-DTB volume 
	?	validation of a specified subset of tests in any of the above 

C.3.2.2 Output Requirements
After validating a DTB or part thereof, the Sample Implementation shall, if at all possible, output
the following data:
	?	the locus of the occurrence depicted as exactly as possible (path, filename, line, column). 
	?	a description of the type/nature of the occurrence. This should be provided in several versions (technical, non-technical, abbreviated, extensive) to better suit differing use cases. 
	?	a statement on whether the occurrence represents a warning or an error state. 
	?	a pointer to the specification/specification fragment, where the occurrence is defined in its expected/correct state. 

C.3.2.3 User Interface Requirements
The user interface of the application should be:
	?	simple enough to use by users without extensive technical knowledge 
	?	allow the user to save a report as a machine-readable and/or human-readable document 
	?	allow the user to cancel the validation whilst in operation 
	?	allow the user to select a subset of tests to perform 
	?	be accessible to users that are blind or otherwise visually impaired
