<DESC>The US General Services Administration, Northeast & Caribbean Region intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a two-phase award of multiple firm-fixed price contracts to successful offerors to provide for an upgraded Smart Card Reader, to ultimately replace the existing Smart Card Reader to an existing Physical Access Control System (PACS).  In Phase One, the proposed acquisition shall require all necessary Engineering, Furnishing, Installation, Security, Testing, and Documentation of the smart card reader upgrade to the existing physical access control system.  The functional interface capabilities of the reader must include Contact and Contact less, PIN/Keypad, and Biometric (fingerprint).  The smart card reader must be able to read multiple card formats, including legacy smart cards (based on GSC-IS v2.0) currently in use.  The smart card reader must be compliant with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 and associated special publications (like NIST Special Publication 800-76 Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification).  Upon Government acceptance of an offeror(s?) fully operational smart card reader that is in full compliance with all specifications listed, for the second phase, the offeror(s) will then be issued an RFP for the replacements, additional spares, and maintenance requirement to replace the existing Smart Card Reader to the existing PACS, fully and wholly integrated with the PACS software as a fully operational and functional system. The GSA intends to award up to three contracts. The contractor(s) shall perform all work necessary to ensure complete day-to-day performance operational capabilities of the new smart card readers, to be incorporated into existing ACS Optical Portals.  The spares award will provide for future quantity acquisition of spare parts and additional readers as needed by the GSA and other Government agencies.  The accepted smart card reader resulting from Phase one award must be listed on the GSA Approved Products List (APL) at the time of Implementation/full deployment and Cutover Process to be eligible for award in Phase two.  This procurement is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED requirement.    The applicable NAICS Code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement shall be procured under Best value continuum, employing the source selection process, trade-off methodology IAW FAR Subpart 15.101-1.  The evaluation factors for this requirement will include the following:  Technical approach and capabilities, Management Approach, Past Performance, and Price.  The Government reserves the right not to convene discussions with successful offerors.  All offerors, whose proposals have been evaluated to be the highest rated in technical, and whose proposed prices were determined to be fair and reasonable for award, may be subject to a background check prior to receiving an award.  The solicitation will be issued on or about 21 May 2007.  The duration of initial phase of the requirement is approximately 60 calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan is required for all large firms for awards greater than $500,000.00. A site visit is scheduled for the week of 21 May 2007.  All interested parties may submit their inquiries to Ed Lew via e-mail at edward.lew@gsa.gov and to Peter Han at peter.han@gsa.gov.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Contractor Qualification Statements from construction contractors desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified general contractors for construction of repair and alteration projects in northern California.  This area extends from the northern California border down to and including the counties of Monterey, Kings, Tulare and Inyo.  Construction activities may occur in operating mail-handling facilities possibly with 24 hour, seven days a week operations, and in such case, construction activities must not interfere with postal operations.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience, must have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the area over the past five years, and must hold a current State of California contractor?s license or have an application for said license on file with the state license board.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as repair and alteration projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities and a construction cost of $1,500,000.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  comparable experience (60 points); non-comparable experience (40 points); organization (30 points); safety (20 points).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, eligibility, certification and affirmation, financial capability, bonding information.  Contractors placed on the prequalified list will be requested to submit a management plan and cost proposal that will be project specific.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Award of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award.  (2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to cristina.valdez@usps.gov or grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov, or nancy.young@usps.gov.

1. Scope
The purpose of this document is to define the business and technical requirements needed by the 58th SOW for the procurement of a Suspense Tracking Software Application. The Contractors quote will be fully burdened to include all costs associated with the application and training of end users on the software.

2. Overview and Objective
The 58th SOW is in need of an automated process to track suspenses and routing of documents.  The selected implementation is a suspense tracker application by a vender in addition to the creation of a Microsoft SharePoint site that will collaborate with the application.

3. Business Justification
Currently all groups and squadrons in the 58th SOW use a mix of applications to track suspenses and routing.  Some organizations have implemented elaborate Access databases while others use simple spreadsheets.  There is little to no collaboration of data up the hierarchy of the organizational structure within the wing and often suspenses are not met and documents get lost or forgotten on someone?s desk.

4. Business Requirements
The 58th SOW requires the use of a system capable of tracking any and all suspenses both upward and downward directed. The system will be capable of serial and parallel notification via email of all personnel involved with a particular suspense. 

Additionally the system will be able to synchronize with the tracker portion of Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2003.  Users should be able to see all suspenses created in the tracker application on their Outlook calendars.  They will also be able to see all taskers created in Outlook, associated with them in the tracker program.

4.1 Basic Work/Business Process
4.1.1	Taskers are originated by AETC and 19th AF.  A function will be available that will allow the secretary to pull those taskers directly into the Suspense Tracker.  
4.1.2 	Reports are generated by the Wing secretary, the two executive officers and other administrative staff to show:
a. All suspenses not closed
b. All closed suspenses
c. Suspenses due within 10 days
d. Suspenses due within 3 days
e. Suspense due within 1 day
f. Suspenses late
g. Turnaround time by task
h. Time to complete a task by organizations
i. List of organizations that did not complete a task
j. List of organizations that did not complete a task on time
4.1.3	Each user within 58 SOW will be able to generate workflows and tasks as needed to fulfill their mission requirements.
4.1.4	Users, administrative personnel and supervisors with receive automated notification when:
	a. An EPR is 4 months from closeout
	b. An OPR is 4 months from closeout
	c. A feedback is 60 days from due date
	d. A D?cor 6 is 30 days from due date 
Note: The technical details are provided below of how this will be accomplished.
4.2 Processes to be automated
4.2.1	Currently 58 SOW organizations use several different spreadsheets to track when OPR/EPR/Feedbacks are due.  These spreadsheets will be consolidated by the 58th SOW SC and placed into SharePoint.  The application will query the shared spreadsheet at 1200 every night and automatically generate a new suspense for any EPR, OPR, feedbacks or D?COR 6s that are due within the timeframe identified below.
	a. An EPR is 4 months from closeout
	b. An OPR is 4 months from closeout
	c. A feedback is 60 days from due date
	d. A D?COR 6 is 30 days from due date 
An option is to add ?Rater?, ?Date Last EPR/OPR?, and ?Separation/PCS/PCA Date? fields in the personnel table and then this can lose dependence on a spreadsheet. In this case as part of the tracker application installation this data will be bulk-loaded before standing up.
4.2.2	Requirement

5. Technical Requirements
5.1 Hardware Requirements
5.1.1	No network hardware will be required beyond the SharePoint Server that the 377th will allow the 58th SOW to use for this application.
5.1.2	CAC Card readers will be required on all user PCs to provide authorization and authentication to the application.
5.2 Software Requirements
5.2.1	Currently 58 SOW has a SharePoint sight provided by the 377th MSG.  The Suspense Tracker will reside on the same server that hosts the base SharePoint system.  The suspense application will have access to portions of the 58th SOW SharePoint space that holds documents related to the workflows and taskers.  Security permissions will be synchronized between SharePoint and the Suspense Tracker.
5.2.2  	The Suspense Tracker will use the same SQL Server that services the SharePoint system.
6. Functional Requirements
The suspense tracker will be able to generate tasks/suspenses, notify users in serial or parallel, generate reports and archive past data for the 58th SOW.
6.1 Data Acquisition Requirements
6.1.1	The Suspense Tracker will query a shared spreadsheet residing on the 58th SOW SharePoint space 1200 every night to automatically generate a new suspense for any EPR, OPR, feedbacks or D?cor 6s due within a specified window.
6.1.2	The suspense tracker will have an option on the main page to perform a change of reporting official (CRO). This function will generate required packages/forms including EPR or OPR if needed. Additionally the Tracker will route packages to appropriate personnel.
6.1.3	The tracker will be able to bulk-load employees from the Global Address List and allow a user to enter rater, separation/PCS/PCA date and date of last report into each persons account file.
6.2 Data Analysis Requirements
6.2.1	The system will analyze report and separation/PCS/PCA information to generate suspenses for EPRs, OPRs, performance feedbacks, and D?cor 6s.
6.3 Data Output Requirements
6.3.1	Reports are generated by the Wing secretary, the two executive officers and other administrative staff to show:
a. All suspenses not closed
b. All closed suspenses
c. Suspenses due within 10 days
d. Suspenses due within 3 days
e. Suspense due within 1 day
f. Suspenses that are late
g. Turnaround time by task
h. Time to complete a task by organizations
I. List of organizations that did not complete a task
J. List of organizations that did not complete a task on time
6.3.2	The tracker application will be able to archive data within a provided data range upon request via a dialog box or form page.
7. Security Authorization Requirements
7.1 Physical Security
7.1.1	The system will reside in a protected facility provided by the 377th MSG.
7.2 Logical Security
The system will use CAC/PKI to allow system access.  Permissions for documents will be controlled either by SharePoint or the suspense tracker. Users will only be able to see information that pertains to them or people they are responsible for!  This is a hard requirement by the 58th SOW.  Administrative and command staff will have visibility to all information that resides within their organization.

8. Operate, Support, and Use Requirements
8.1 System Operation and Support Requirements
8.2 Service/Maintenance Requirements
Geographic Distribution

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 with Red Rapids Inc, 797 N Grove Rd Ste 101, Richardson TX 75081 for 1 Signal Recorder/Playback Cube. This multiband signal recorder/playback uses low cost software defined radio technology already deployed in a wide range of communication applications and includes a high performance Pentium based host computer running Linux OS with PCI transceiver card and a suite of interface software. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: 

AFRL requires this item to construct an in-house validation facility to support ongoing research efforts.  None of the recorder/playback units reviewed equaled the proposed sole source offering in terms of performance, small size, included features, and relatively low cost. To use another company?s item would result in a loss of test capability; other offerings are not as capable or portable at the same cost. The radio is only manufactured and distributed by Red Rapids.

b.  2 each FITEL S177 Connector Termination Add-On Kits
c.  100 each Seikoh Giken SC/UPC Splice-On-Connectors, 900um
d.  100 each Seikoh Giken SC/UPC Splice-On-Connectors, 3mm
e.  100 each Seikoh Giken SC/UPC Splice-On-Connectors, 2mm

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

Requiring Activity:  DISA-PAC Transmission Networks Division (PC4)

This equipment and hardware will be used to slice pre-connectorized pigtales on facility fiber optic tie-cables, splice connectors on fiber optic cables used for cross-connecting fiber distribution panels and splice connectors on fiber optic cables interconnecting transport equipment.  This splice-on-connector approach will eliminate the need for field polishing of fiber connector tips, significantly improving the quality of the termination and reducing the installation time.  Also, since this is a core alignment fusion splice system, the finished fiber optic cable will have less reflection and light loss than cables using the existing approach.

FITEL is the only brand name found that makes a core-alignment fusion splicer that can also be used to terminate splice-on connectors.  FITEL's connector termination process requires no polishing or epoxy, thus increasing the quality and consistency of field connector termination.  Total installation time will be greatly reduced compared to traditional methods.

<DESC>The NHLBI is seeking Clinical Centers (CC) for a new seven-year multi-center clinical research study entitled, Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS).  Contractors will design and conduct a longitudinal, observational study, with extensive subject phenotyping, to identify subpopulations among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to identify and validate surrogate markers of disease severity which will be useful as intermediate outcome measures for clinical trials.  Secondary aims are to clarify the natural history of COPD, to develop bioinformatic resources that will enable the utilization and sharing of data among studies of COPD and related diseases, and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.  

Research subjects will be enrolled, phenotyped, and followed at approximately six Clinical Centers.  A Genomics and Informatics Center and a Radiology Center will be awarded under separate solicitations.

This observational study will collect and analyze phenotypic, biomarker, genetic, genomic, and clinical data from several thousand research subjects with COPD.  High throughput genetic, genomic, and proteomic analyses of biospecimens will be performed by core laboratories contracted separately.  Baseline data will be analyzed in a cross-sectional manner to identify subpopulations of patients with similar molecular abnormalities.  Longitudinal data will be used to identify and validate intermediate outcome measures, such as x-ray computed tomographic (CT) image, biomarker, and genomic measures whose spontaneous changes over a period of 9-12 months correlate with long-term outcomes of mortality, frequency of hospitalizations, change in spirometry, and change in quality of life.  Secondary aims are to develop a bioinformatic infrastructure that will enable the utilization and sharing of pulmonary research data and to create a collection of clinical, biomarker, radiographic, and genetic data that can be used by external investigators for other studies of COPD.  

This is not a request for proposals (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. It is anticipated that the RFPs will be available on or about September 20, 2007 at:  http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp and posted on FedBizOpps.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (NASA/DFRC) has a requirement to establish a sole source blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for the MAINTENANCE, MODIFICATION, UPGRADES, AND SUPPLIES FOR AIRBORNE AND GROUND ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEMS USED IN FLIGHT RESEARCH; ONE (1) JOB.  The period of performance of this BPA shall not exceed five (5) years. OBJECTIVE: The contractor will be tasked by NASA/DFRC to provide technical support and maintenance beyond the scope of maintenance tasks currently performed by NASA/DFRC avionics maintenance personnel; improvements and enhancements to currently fielded system; development of new imaging capabilities.  Sufficient documentation and inspection shall be provided to assure flight safety and proper function of all pod and camera components, and recording system components.  This may also include the purchase of various imaging hardware to support these efforts.  Sufficient documentation and inspection shall be provided to assure flight safety and proper function of all pod and camera components.  NASA/DFRC anticipates that task assignments will occur through written direction (task order).  However, large or complex task assignments will be detailed in written task assignments with specific deliverables as appropriate. NASA/DFRC intends to procure these services on a sole source basis from PVP Advanced EO Systems, Incorporated (PVP) of Tustin, California under the authority of FAR 6.302 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Justification is based upon PVP's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services.	PVP designed and engineered the existing imaging equipment.  Due to the highly specialized nature of this service and existing systems, PVP is the only source with prior experience that is vital to the successful satisfaction of the requirement.  Award to another source would be too costly and delay current and future flight programs/schedules. These services will be provided through a "task order" type arrangement.  This is a follow-on to an existing BPA vehicle. This procurement will be conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 333314 and 500 employees, respectively. The DPAS Rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30PM (PST) on September 24, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Office of Systems Safety and Mission Assurance (OSSMA), Resource Analysis Office (RAO), located at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD is to provide capability to Center management for independent cost and schedule estimating, risk assessment, and mission risk success utilizing existing and projected programs, their cost, technical, programmatic and acquisition implementation approach.  This Office has the responsibility which includes the development and maintenance of current cost models supported by resource and technical databases, compiled from current and historical data derived and collected from NASA’s “corporate memory,” as well as from on-going market surveys and current cost projections, quotes, bids, and estimates. This capability is critical to the efficient operation of the Center, in that it involves the development of accurate resource estimation and forecasting models for the planning and acquisition of future spacecraft programs and ancillary scientific instruments, scientific payloads and suites, mission systems integration and test, and other key resource elements (i.e. cost, schedule, workforce, and risk assessment). Given the critical nature of the forecasting required, the work of the RAO includes both long-term studies and unforeseeable ad hoc investigations that require short or immediate turnaround times. The RAO has determined that at the present time, only Cost Inc 8236 Sandy Stream Road, Laurel MD meets this requirement. The governing statutory provision is 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1), "only One Responsible Source."  Other offerors interested in demonstrating their ability to meet the requirments of the Statement of work are invited to submit a written statement of their capabilities, qualifications, and management and transition plans to Russellyn Hart Russellyn.Rogers-1@nasa.gov or Yolanda Williams Yolanda.A.Williams@nasa.gov by email.  Not later than 4:30 EST on Wednesday Oct 3, 2007.  Submissions made by any other means will not be considered.  Responses will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining wheter this procurement should proceed on a single source basis. After a thorough evaluation of all responsible proposals received by the indicated deadline determination by the Government that a full and open competition ofor this effort will or will not be conducted will be made solely at the agency's discreption  OMBUDSMAN STATEMENT IS REQUIRED An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US General Services Administration, Northeast & Caribbean Region intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a two-phase award of multiple firm-fixed price contracts to successful offerors to provide for an upgraded Smart Card Reader Terminal, to ultimately replace the existing Smart Card Reader Terminal to an existing Physical Access Control System (PACS).     In Phase One, the proposed acquisition shall require all necessary Engineering, Furnishing, Installation, Security, Testing, and Documentation of the smart card reader upgrade to the existing physical access control system. The functional interface capabilities of the reader must include Contact and Contact less, PIN/Keypad, and Biometric (fingerprint). The smart card reader must be able to read multiple card formats, including legacy smart cards (based on GSC-IS v2.0) currently in use. The smart card reader must be compliant with HSPD-12 and FIPS 201 and associated special publications (like NIST Special Publication 800-76 Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification).     Upon Government acceptance of an offeror(s?) fully operational smart card reader that is in full compliance with all specifications listed, for the second phase, the offeror(s) will then be issued an RFP for the replacements, additional spares, and maintenance requirement to replace the existing Smart Card Reader Terminal to the existing PACS, fully and wholly integrated with the PACS software as a fully operational and functional system. The GSA intends to award up to three contracts. The contractor(s) shall perform all work necessary to ensure complete day-to-day performance operational capabilities of the new Smart Card Reader Terminals, to be incorporated into existing ACS Optical Portals.     The spares award will provide for future quantity acquisition of spare parts and additional readers as needed by the GSA and other Government agencies. The accepted Terminals resulting from Phase one award must be listed on the GSA Approved Products List (APL) at the time of Implementation/full deployment and Cutover Process to be eligible for award in Phase two. This procurement is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED requirement. The applicable NAICS Code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement shall be procured under Best value continuum, employing the source selection process, lowest priced technically acceptable methodology IAW FAR Subpart 15.101-2.     The evaluation factors for this requirement will include the following:     Technical approach and capabilities, Management Approach, Past Performance, and Price.     The Government reserves the right not to convene discussions with successful offerors.     All offerors, whose proposals have been evaluated to be the highest rated in technical, and whose proposed prices were determined to be fair and reasonable for award, may be subject to a background check prior to receiving an award. The solicitation will be issued on or about 31 May 2007. The duration of initial phase of the requirement is approximately 60 calendar days after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan is required for all large firms for awards greater than $550,000.00. A site visit is scheduled for the week of 11 June 2007. All interested parties may submit their inquiries to Ed Lew via e-mail at edward.lew@gsa.gov and to Peter Han at peter.han@gsa.gov.

Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system.

<SUBJECT>R -- Administrative Support Services for the NIH Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>263-2007-M(GO)-0166
<RESPDATE>061107
<CONTACT>Zedekiah Worsham, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-3560, Fax 301-451-5372, Email worshamz@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting market research to determine the capabilities of all businesses (large and small) interested in the opportunity described below.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000. Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist NIH in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources; however, all size organizations are encouraged to respond. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) will apply. 

This requirement is to obtain administrative services on a long term basis across all of the NIH Institutes, Divisions, and Centers and Offices. This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent. This requirement will likely be a multiple award contract. The potential contractors for this acquisition will be required to provide up to 500 administrative support personnel gradually over a 5 year period. Since administrative support demand will vary, contractors must be able to scale accordingly. Services required will be performed in a scientific research environment; therefore, administrative personnel should have some experience or familiarity working in such a field. 

A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is included with this Sources Sought. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the accompanying DRAFT SOW to become familiar with the requirements of this project.

To make a reasonable determination of available capabilities and vendor interest in responding to this solicitation for administrative support services, NIH asks that vendors review the requirements outlined in the DRAFT SOW and respond with their intent on proposing. In general, while this Sources Sought is not a request for a technical proposal, respondents should provide enough information for NIH to make a determination that the vendor has the capability to perform the same or similar work as identified in the attached DRAFT SOW. 

Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages for sections one (1) through four (4) of the below. Sections five (5) and six (6) are together limited to no more than 5 pages and shall be a separate attachment from sections one (1) through four (4):

1.	Business Information  

a.	Company name
b.	Company address
c.	D&B Duns Number
d.      JWOD Status of the Company (JWOD Company or not)
e.	Socio-economic classification of company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, serviced disabled veteran owned, Hubzone, large business, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Note: All vendors who wish to be awarded a Government contract must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.
f.	Size (gross revenue, number of employees in company)
g.	Number of years in existence
h.	Company point of contact - name, phone and email address
i.	List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer. References must be relevant to the requirement and work must have been performed within the three years prior to May 24, 2007. 
j.	NIH encourages teaming or subcontracting arrangements among vendors. If the vendor has any existing or prior teaming arrangements with other vendors to provide this type service, please briefly identify these arrangements and the percentage of work completed by the responding vendor and its subcontractor. Example: 
Vendor ABC acted as the prime and Vendor XYZ provided support as a subcontractor on a contract providing administrative support services to a large federal agency. The contract involved XX positions and the services provided were divided as follows:
Vendor ABC (Prime)	      	                        51%
Vendor XYZ (Subcontractor)	                        49%

2.	Vendor's Capabilities 

A description of the vendor's capabilities to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and the attached DRAFT SOW. As demand for administrative support may vary, please include any approaches the company may have used in other contracts (with government or commercial customers) of similar scope to satisfy the surge needs of other clients. 

3.	Management Approach 

The proposed solicitation will not be a personal services contract, which means that the government project officer will not maintain an employer-employee relationship with the administrative support personnel on-site. Therefore, vendors will be required to manage their employees who will be working at NIH facilities. 

Contractor supervisors will be utilized as much as possible during the administration of this contract and will be required to: conduct reviews (or other quality control procedures) with respect to the tasks and projects performed by their employees; address performance issues; gauge (or report on) any applicable performance measures; and conduct performance evaluations of the employees. In addition, contractor supervisors will be expected to engage in at least some of their supervisory tasks on site. 

Please provide an explanation of your firm's capability to provide the type of management infrastructure described above and comment on how communication may be delivered among the government, the contractor supervisors, and the administrative personnel. If your firm is not located near NIH facilities (see DRAFT SOW Section VII), please describe how your firm has managed geographically dispersed employees in previous contracts for similar services.

In addition, provide comments on your firm's capability to implement other elements of a successful management approach that include cost effectiveness, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of long term administrative support, and customer satisfaction. Finally, please describe how your firm has addressed any issues regarding personnel performance in the past. 

4.	Past Experience 

Vendors should state and describe their past experience with a project of the size, magnitude, and complexity in a scientific research or other technical environment as outlined in the DRAFT SOW. Please include the company's past (or current) experience description and its ability to acquire, maintain, and train qualified administrative support staff. 

5.	Contract Type/Performance Based Considerations 

NIH has not determined a contract type for this proposed procurement and is soliciting recommendations on the contract type(s) for the services in the DRAFT SOW based on past experience with similar requirements.

NIH is considering incorporating performance-based measures for these services. Please review the proposed performance measures in the DRAFT SOW and provide any comments/recommendations for the performance measures, standards, and acceptable quality levels (AQL).

6.	DRAFT SOW Comments/Questions 

The attached DRAFT SOW is a draft document and will be finalized with issuance of a solicitation. NIH is interested in your feedback on the attached DRAFT SOW. In addition to providing responses to the questions above, you are encouraged to also submit DRAFT SOW questions and comments. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, NIH will not be able to respond to questions and comments submitted. However, the questions and comments will be used to revise the DRAFT SOW in an effort to provide a value added final product. Additionally, a pre-solicitation conference may be held at a future, to be determined date.

For each DRAFT SOW question/comment submitted, the respondent should provide:

o	DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) section number;
o	Title of the DRAFT SOW section; and
o	Complete description of the question.

Example:  
DRAFT SOW Section II, entitled Scope of Contract
Comment: State comment, question, clarification.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

This requirement will also include:  (1) the overhaul/repair of model numbers 46123R253,46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be other than full and open competition using the Philadelphia Gear Company only.  The work shall be performed in accordance with Philadelphia Gear Company specifications, standards and recommended procedures for overhaul of the listed pumps.  All parts and facilities used during the overhaul shall be Philadelphia Gear Company facilities and parts.  Technical Data and/or drawings pertaining to Philadelphia Gear Company parts/services are proprietary to the OEM.  Accordingly it is believed that this non-availability of technical date precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition as they are  available from this source.  See number notes 22, and 26

<DESC>*This announcement provides notification of the release of the final RFP N00421-05-R-0053.*The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Navigation Systems Program Office, PMA/PMW-170, has a classified requirement for the development and testing of a conformal antenna for the F/A-18 E/F/G series aircraft in support of the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) program.  The goal of this antenna is to meet or exceed the performance requirements of the GAS-1 system with the additional requirements of being conformal, M-code compliant, and meeting Low Radar Cross Section (Low Observable (LO)) requirements.  The conformal antenna design will be consistent with mounting on the  top fuselage of the F/A-18 E/F/G.

The Government intends to procure a seven-element antenna of approximately 14 inches in diameter.  The antenna must meet classified requirements.  The projected procurement quantity for the targeted platforms is approximately 234 production units, plus 10% spares, over the life of the contract (base year plus a maximum of four option years).  The initial quantity being required for delivery in Fiscal Year 06 (FY06) is approximately eight (8) R&D units.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation that will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.   The Government reserves the right to select a contract at other than the lowest price.

<SUBJECT>A -- Management of the Primate Aging Database
<SOLNBR>NIHAG2007001
<RESPDATE>091307
<ARCHDATE>09282007
<CONTACT>Louis Kuta, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8024, Fax 301-402-0178, Email kutal@od.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential vendors that have the experience and capability to fulfill the attached requirement.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITAITON IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This sources sought announcement is in support of market research being conducted by the National Institutes of Health to identify small business sources (including small business programs:  8(a), HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran) that are capable of performing the requirements identified in the Description and in the paragraphs below.  The intended procurement will be classified under 2007 NAICS 541712 (previously 541710 under the 2002 NAICS).

The Primate Aging Database (PAD) is a searchable database developed to allow analysis of age-related traits in non-human primates (NHP).  Currently, the database contains data from 20 species at 11 different institutions, comprising over 3000 individual animals and 500,000 data points.  About 80% of the data is from rhesus monkeys.  Current data fields are primarily lifespan, body composition parameters, and blood chemistry parameters, although addition of other parameters is possible.  The PAD is useful for analyses of species differences in normal aging processes, studies on biomarkers of normal aging and age-related pathologies, and determination of baseline levels in geriatric NHP colonies.  The PAD was written on a Microsoft Access platform and was converted to a web-based platform under the current contract, N01-AG-3-1014.

The purpose of the Primate Aging Database (PAD) is to compile data on biological measurements in non-human primates (NHP) from as many primate colonies as possible and disseminate this information to the scientific community.  This will provide a new research resource to allow investigators to analyze the effect of aging on many biomarkers with the goal of identifying parameters that define the aging process.  It will serve the added function of providing normative values for researchers and veterinarians providing care to aged NHP, allowing them to better assess the health of their charges.  This resource will promote advances in aging research without requiring additional animals since it will bring together a large amount of data generated by many different institutions and investigators.

The objective of this contract is to host and maintain PAD on the Contractor?s server, provide it to investigators in the research community, provide technical assistance with its use, and continue to add data on biological measurements in non-human primates.

The Government will provide to the Contractor the PAD and software that have already been developed.  All data in the database, the software, and the codebook shall remain property of the Government.

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, and equipment (except for those to be furnished by the government as specified elsewhere in this contract) to perform the work required by this contract as set forth below.

Specifically, the Contractor shall:

1.  Transfer PAD and the PAD customer database to a secure server at the Contractor?s facility and maintain a back-up copy, provide all maintenance and repairs to keep the server functioning properly.  A transition period of no more than one month should be proposed, and the PAD shall be off-line for no more than 48 hours during the transition period.

Note:  offerors should provide details on the transfer of the database and how the transition period will be structured.

2.  Provide the PAD to investigators in the research community via the password protected website.  All costs associated with distribution of the PAD to investigators shall be borne by the contract.  As liaison with the research community, the Contractor shall be responsible for evaluating all applications for a password to PAD to ensure the users are legitimate researchers and for informing investigators of the publication policy as set forth by the PAD Steering Committee and communicated to the Contractor by the Project Officer.

3.  Provide technical assistance to investigators using PAD, through one-on-one consultations and refinements to the codebook.

4.  Fix any reported problems with the PAD software and the hardware housing the database.  Any significant problems affecting utilization of the database by investigators shall be reported to the Project Officer immediately.  The Contractor shall keep a log of all significant problems encountered by investigators attempting to access PAD, and report these problems in the semi-annual progress reports (4.A. below).

5.  Maintain viewer controls on access to data.  Data in PAD is available to users as means, medians and graphs, but individual data points are not identified.  Only submitters are allowed to see their own raw data.  The Project Officer will inform the Contractor of any changes in the policy on data access that the PAD Steering Committee implements.  The Contractor does not have the authority to make changes to data access without the authorization of the Project Officer.

6.  Solicit new data from the research community as directed by the Project Officer, enter the data into PAD, and perform quality control analyses of the data.  Data will be solicited from institutions that have already contributed data to PAD, as updates and data on new animals becomes available, and from new sources identified by the Project Officer or by the Contractor and approved by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall be responsible for informing investigators of the data ownership policy, as developed by the PAD Steering Committee and provided by the Project Officer.

Note: the format in which the data will be submitted will vary from source to source.  Some data will be submitted electronically in a format compatible with electronic transfer into the database; other data will be submitted as paper copies that need to be manually entered.

7.  Maintain a list of all recipients of the passwords to the database and all publications resulting from the use of PAD.

8.  Maintain a back-up copy of the database, codebook and software to protect against accidental loss.  The back up should be up-dated every week and stored off-site or on-site in a fireproof safe.

9.  Provide security for all computers that contain copies of the database and all supporting information required by this statement of work, including locking down computers and using password protection for access to the computer files containing information relating to the database and investigators using the database.

10.  Advertise the PAD by demonstrations at scientific meetings.  Contract personnel shall attend and sponsor a booth at 2-3 scientific meetings per year, to be approved in advance by the Project Officer, and provide directed, hands-on demonstrations of the PAD.

The period of performance will be based on continued scientific interest in this resource.  Therefore, a contract consisting of one base year and four option years is suggested.  The anticipated start date is September 1, 2008 continuing through August 31, 2013.

Semi-annual progress reports shall be delivered to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of each six month period of the contract.  The initial report shall be submitted for the first full six months of the contract performance including any fractional part of the initial month.  Thereafter, the reporting period shall consist of six full calendar months.  A semi-annual report will not be required for the period when the final report is due.  Semi-annual progress reports shall include any changes in Contractor personnel, the number of staff-hours committed to the contract project for the reporting period, the source and number of data points entered into the database for each species, a summary of revisions to the codebook completed during the reporting period, a list of investigators who received login passwords to the database, a list of publications resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.

A final report shall be submitted to the Project Officer (1 copy) and the Contracting Officer (1 copy) on or before completion of this contract.  The final report shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance, including the number of data points entered for each species, investigators who received the database, publication resulting from use of the database, and any technical problems reported by investigators and how they were addressed.  Two (2) copies (CDs) of the most up-to-date version of the database shall be submitted to the Project Officer with the final report.

Interested small businesses are invited to submit a capability statement addressing the ability to satisfy the requirement.  The capability statement should reference sources sought synopsis number NIHAG2007001 and should be no longer than 15 pages in length (personnel qualifications are not included in page count) and shall include the following:  (1) name and address of the company; size standard and small business program status of the company as listed under www.ccr.gov; (2) point of contact with name, title, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address; (3) DUNS number; (4) contractor's capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability, knowledge, and experience specific to the requirements set forth in the draft statement of work; (5) lists of three clients to whom similar types of services have been previously provided within the last three years to include contract number, dollar value, and name and telephone number of point of contact; and (6) qualifications and experience of any key personnel likely to perform directly under any resultant contract.

Technical Specifications of current version of the PAD:
- Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Web Server: Apache
- Language: Java
- Database: MySQL v5.0.27

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

<DESC>SEE ATTACHED AMENDMENT 0001.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) on behalf of the United States Attorney?s Office Eastern District of Michigan invites contractors to submit a proposal for services described in the attached statement of work, under the authority of Part 12 and 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Re-surfacing of System Furniture Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by September 13, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. (EST).  This RFP in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. 

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on technical capability, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.   The Proposals shall include the following information:

(1) Sufficient detail that demonstrates contractor?s technical capability to meet the requirements outlined in the statement of work.  The contractor must demonstrate the following:

A)	Personnel is experienced and proficient in removing fabric from Haworth Systems furniture panels and corner posts, cutting fabric to fit panels and posts and recovering panels and posts.
B)	Provide sufficient staff during the timeframes described in the statement of work to complete work within the stated period of performance.
C)	Properly dispose of the removed fabric and work area is clean/free from material on a daily basis.

(2) Provide up to three (3) references for commensurate projects that are in progress or were completed within the last three (3) years.  If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed
	
(3)  A summary of the Contractor?s experience demonstrating the contractor?s knowledge and ability to perform the duties and tasks reflected in the Scope of Work. This summary shall not exceed two (2) pages.
	
(4)  Price quote as reflected in Section B.

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 811420.  In order to be considered a small business under this NAICS code, your average annual receipts must not exceed $6.5 million.  

The Government estimated value of this purchase order is $40,000.00.  The precise period of performance will be determined at the time of award. 

Proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be received in the following manner: via regular mail (please allow additional time for security screening), hand carried, and email.  Proposal may also be forwarded by Courier or Overnight Mail Service to the attention of the undersigned at EOUSA.

<SUBJECT>R -- Administrative Support Services for the NIH Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>263-2007-M(GO)-0166
<RESPDATE>061107
<CONTACT>Zedekiah Worsham, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-3560, Fax 301-451-5372, Email worshamz@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting market research to determine the capabilities of all businesses (large and small) interested in the opportunity described below.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000. Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist NIH in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources; however, all size organizations are encouraged to respond. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) will apply. 

This requirement is to obtain administrative services on a long term basis across all of the NIH Institutes, Divisions, and Centers and Offices. This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent. This requirement will likely be a multiple award contract. The potential contractors for this acquisition will be required to provide up to 500 administrative support personnel gradually over a 5 year period. Since administrative support demand will vary, contractors must be able to scale accordingly. Services required will be performed in a scientific research environment; therefore, administrative personnel should have some experience or familiarity working in such a field. 

A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is included with this Sources Sought. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the accompanying DRAFT SOW to become familiar with the requirements of this project.

To make a reasonable determination of available capabilities and vendor interest in responding to this solicitation for administrative support services, NIH asks that vendors review the requirements outlined in the DRAFT SOW and respond with their intent on proposing. In general, while this Sources Sought is not a request for a technical proposal, respondents should provide enough information for NIH to make a determination that the vendor has the capability to perform the same or similar work as identified in the attached DRAFT SOW. 

Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages for sections one (1) through four (4) of the below. Sections five (5) and six (6) are together limited to no more than 5 pages and shall be a separate attachment from sections one (1) through four (4):

1.	Business Information  

a.	Company name
b.	Company address
c.	D&B Duns Number
d.	Socio-economic classification of company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, serviced disabled veteran owned, Hubzone, large business, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Note: All vendors who wish to be awarded a Government contract must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.
e.	Size (gross revenue, number of employees in company)
f.	Number of years in existence
g.	Company point of contact - name, phone and email address
h.	List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer. References must be relevant to the requirement and work must have been performed within the three years prior to May 24, 2007. 
i.	NIH encourages teaming or subcontracting arrangements among vendors. If the vendor has any existing or prior teaming arrangements with other vendors to provide this type service, please briefly identify these arrangements and the percentage of work completed by the responding vendor and its subcontractor. Example: 
Vendor ABC acted as the prime and Vendor XYZ provided support as a subcontractor on a contract providing administrative support services to a large federal agency. The contract involved XX positions and the services provided were divided as follows:
Vendor ABC (Prime)	      	                        51%
Vendor XYZ (Subcontractor)	                        49%

2.	Vendor's Capabilities 

A description of the vendor's capabilities to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and the attached DRAFT SOW. As demand for administrative support may vary, please include any approaches the company may have used in other contracts (with government or commercial customers) of similar scope to satisfy the surge needs of other clients. 

3.	Management Approach 

The proposed solicitation will not be a personal services contract, which means that the government project officer will not maintain an employer-employee relationship with the administrative support personnel on-site. Therefore, vendors will be required to manage their employees who will be working at NIH facilities. 

Contractor supervisors will be utilized as much as possible during the administration of this contract and will be required to: conduct reviews (or other quality control procedures) with respect to the tasks and projects performed by their employees; address performance issues; gauge (or report on) any applicable performance measures; and conduct performance evaluations of the employees. In addition, contractor supervisors will be expected to engage in at least some of their supervisory tasks on site. 

Please provide an explanation of your firm's capability to provide the type of management infrastructure described above and comment on how communication may be delivered among the government, the contractor supervisors, and the administrative personnel. If your firm is not located near NIH facilities (see DRAFT SOW Section VII), please describe how your firm has managed geographically dispersed employees in previous contracts for similar services.

In addition, provide comments on your firm's capability to implement other elements of a successful management approach that include cost effectiveness, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of long term administrative support, and customer satisfaction. Finally, please describe how your firm has addressed any issues regarding personnel performance in the past. 

4.	Past Experience 

Vendors should state and describe their past experience with a project of the size, magnitude, and complexity in a scientific research or other technical environment as outlined in the DRAFT SOW. Please include the company's past (or current) experience description and its ability to acquire, maintain, and train qualified administrative support staff. 

5.	Contract Type/Performance Based Considerations 

NIH has not determined a contract type for this proposed procurement and is soliciting recommendations on the contract type(s) for the services in the DRAFT SOW based on past experience with similar requirements.

NIH is considering incorporating performance-based measures for these services. Please review the proposed performance measures in the DRAFT SOW and provide any comments/recommendations for the performance measures, standards, and acceptable quality levels (AQL).

6.	DRAFT SOW Comments/Questions 

The attached DRAFT SOW is a draft document and will be finalized with issuance of a solicitation. NIH is interested in your feedback on the attached DRAFT SOW. In addition to providing responses to the questions above, you are encouraged to also submit DRAFT SOW questions and comments. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, NIH will not be able to respond to questions and comments submitted. However, the questions and comments will be used to revise the DRAFT SOW in an effort to provide a value added final product. Additionally, a pre-solicitation conference may be held at a future, to be determined date.

For each DRAFT SOW question/comment submitted, the respondent should provide:

o	DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) section number;
o	Title of the DRAFT SOW section; and
o	Complete description of the question.

Example:  
DRAFT SOW Section II, entitled Scope of Contract
Comment: State comment, question, clarification.

<SUBJECT>10--Contract Strategy for National Nuclear Security Administration Nuclear Weapons Complex - Request for Information
<SOLNBR>DE-RP52-08NA28487
<RESPDATE>100107
<ARCHDATE>04012008
<CONTACT>Daniel Saiz, Contracting Officer, (505) 845-4024, dsaiz@doeal.gov;Roxanna Roda, Contract Specialist, 202-586-0068, rroda@doeal.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is planning to develop and implement a contracting strategy to replace or revalidate the current approach of having separate Management and Operating (M&O) contracts at eight government-owned facilities.  Our intention is to have one or more contracts (which may continue to be M&O contracts or could take other appropriate forms) that will promote effective and efficient technical and business operations in support of a more responsive and affordable Nuclear Weapons Complex (NWC). It should be noted that the NWC, while often defined as the eight current NNSA-designated Government-Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) facilities in actuality comprises a broader scope, including Federal facilities, other DOE GOCOs, specialized facilities at universities, specialized facilities at industrial sites, and a significant multi-tier private sector supply chain. While recognizing that the primary focus of an acquisition strategy needs to be on the current NNSA GOCOs, this need not be the sole focus.  We are open to consideration of a facilities-based approach (perhaps combining two or more sites under a single contract) and/or a function-based approach (providing to some or all locations such capabilities as purchasing, financial management, information technology services and management, etc.)  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to initiate an exchange of information with industry and other interested parties including other Federal agencies on potential acquisition alternatives and associated risks and costs for achieving NNSA objectives while promoting vigorous full and open competition.   The NNSA Service Center has established a website at www.doeal.gov/contractstrategy/default.htm for the dissemination of information relating to this initiative.  This website will be the principal distribution medium for the exchange of information among all interested parties.  NNSA is requesting that written comments be submitted to Mr. Daniel Saiz, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at dsaiz@doeal.gov no later than October 1, 2007.  At a later point in this process, NNSA may invite industry and other interested parties to request a one-on-one meeting with NNSA to discuss their ideas with NNSA face-to-face.  NNSA will protect information on the identity of any respondent who requests in writing to remain anonymous.  POTENTIAL ACQUISITION ALTERNATIVES NNSA is interested in an acquisition strategy that will result in complex-wide improvements in the following areas: â€¢ More uniform program execution with improved integration of resources and priorities; â€¢ Increased standardization of technical processes and application of best practices to improve processes and capabilities; â€¢ Improved inter-site coordination, cooperation, information sharing and technical integration; â€¢ Improved workforce planning, maintenance of critical skills, and human capital management; â€¢ Reduced cost and improved performance through streamlining of the organization with reduction of management layers, elimination of unnecessary redundancies, outsourcing appropriate activities, and integration and leveraging of technical and business expertise at multiple sites; â€¢ Increased contractor authority and accountability in accomplishing the NNSA mission;  and â€¢ Sustained competition. Any and all options that will assist NNSA in realizing its desired results are open for consideration.  NNSA requests that respondents identify specific acquisition alternatives and discuss the advantages, disadvantages, constraints, risks, costs, and trade-offs associated with each alternative. Multiple alternatives with the requested information are welcome. Responses to this RFI could include, but are not limited to, consolidation of M&O contracts, use of other types of contracts on a single or multiple facility basis, use of function-based contracts (i.e. construction, information technology) applicable to two or more sites (with provision to be expanded to other sites), transfer of discrete work scope from one or more current contract(s) to other existing or new contracts.  NNSA emphasizes that any and all options are open for consideration, and respondents are requested not to limit responses only to the possibilities identified in this announcement. NNSA is also interested in receiving input regarding alternative contract provisions including but not limited to terms associated with contract type and attendant liability and fee; government furnished facilities; government furnished equipment; government furnished information; innovative workforce strategies (loaned personnel, temporary or limited term hiring); innovative subcontracting strategies (perhaps associated with anticipated long-term other funding sources or sponsorship); and work for others. Input should reflect NNSAâ€™ s desired results as identified above. Disclaimer This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI and responses to this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that can design, develop, manufacture, integrate hardware and software, test and support components for a Next Generation Visual Landing Aid (NGVLA) system.  The NGVLA is intended to be the Navy?s newest shipboard Visual Landing Aid system capable of guiding the present and future naval rotary wing aircraft for safe landings.  The NGVLA is being developed for forward fit into the DDG1000 class destroyers, with potential applications for other future surface combatants.  The major design objectives for the NGVLA are: improve reliability, reduce maintenance & manpower, meet specific requirements of the DDG1000 functionality, mounting configurations, power and controls, lower radar cross section, and meet Night Vision Device compatibility requirements.  Proposed performance parameters for the new NGVLA are expected to be available no earlier than October 1st.  This information will be sent to interested parties upon request.  
        An RFI for this system and notice of industry conference was previously sent out.  The industry conference was held on February, 2007.  This notice is being sent again to inform potential proposers that the scope of the effort has changed.  In addition to the previously described effort, an additional effort of integration to the ship, including physical mountings and Radar Cross section integration has been added.  Rather than just providing the hardware for the shipbuilder to integrate into the ship, the winning contractor of the solicitation will be part of a development Integrated Product Team (IPT).  The IPT is anticipated to include an integration design development of the lighting fixtures and MFD into the Radar Cross section (RCS) design of the ship and meet all RCS budget and installation requirements.  The SGSI contract will not include RCS integration requirements.  The NGVLA program will reflect a system?level acquisition approach for three new components of the total system, which will each be contracted separately.  The Navy?s goal is to develop and procure an entire NGVLA system (Multi-Function Display (MFD), new Stabilized Glideslope Indicator (SGSI), and a new Flight Deck Lighting (FDL) system with associated interfaces.).  Contracts for each component development, logistics data development and test are anticipated with follow-on options for production quantities and Logistics support.  The government intends to structure a program that is economically feasible while meeting the needs of the fleet.  This may result in the contractor(s) pricing out one or more of the NGVLA components as a Modified COTS option.  The SGSI is composed of a stabilized optical projector which projects Green-Yellow-Red beams of light corridors for pilots to receive a visual cue of correct glide slope.   The pilots will receive pulse coded signals for the proper glide slope approach path.  The MFD consists of a ?bill-board? type display mounted on the ship?s superstructure above the hangar doors.  The MFD will present a horizon reference bar and deck status indication, as well as an ASSIST system indication with capability for future expansion.  The FDL is composed of all of the deck lighting and other approach and obstruction indicators required for US Navy aviation certification.  All of the control for power, brightness/dimming, fault indication, and status display will be interfaced through the ships Total Ships Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI ) system.   Operator control functions will be provided by the ship?s CEDS displays.  Interface to the ships data distribution for control and power interface will be specified by the shipbuilder and referenced in the respective component specifications.  The development effort is anticipated to be conducted through an Integrated Product Team (IPT) structure.  The IPT will consist of the contractor/ NGVLA component designer, the ship builder and NAWC Lakehurst NGVLA team members.  The first phase to be executed is the Development phase.  During the Development phase, contractors will develop program plans, develop and produce the System Development & Demonstration SDD hardware and support documentation, and test to prove compliance with specification requirements.  A single contract will be awarded for the (SDD) phase through a fully integrated, production representative system for Technical and Operational Evaluation. (plus additional subsystems/components required to support environmental and shock qualification of the system components).  The SDD system may initially be tested at the NAWCADLKE Test Site.  Following successful completion of an initial Developmental Test (DT) program, the system may be refurbished and installed aboard the DDG1000.  The SDD phase will begin in FY 07 for the SGSI and FY08 for the FDL and MFD and continue into FY 08 and FY09 (18 months).  The Test and Integration phase is expected to last for 36 months, potentially including shipboard install and check-out.  Following a successful test at the land based test site or test facility and shipboard testing, a sole source contract for production quantities will be awarded to support DDG1000 class ship availabilities and possible other class installations.  The production option contract is anticipated to be a sole sourcecontract for production units including technical and logistic data to support DDG1000 class installation availabilities.  Production options will be included to support the DDG1000 construction schedule.  
      Representatives of US companies who have subsidiaries in foreign countries expecting to participate will also be considered under foreign national rules.  Note that information to be provided is subject to export controls.  Please ensure a certified DD From 2345 is  sent to NAVAIR Contracts with your request for performance parameters.

<SOLNBR>RFI_N68335-07-T-0013_RFI
<RESPDATE>101007

<DESC>This is a Request for Information.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command is seeking information from potential sources that can design, develop, manufacture, integrate hardware and software, test and support components for a Next Generation Visual Landing Aid (NGVLA) system.  The NGVLA is intended to be the Navy?s newest shipboard Visual Landing Aid system capable of guiding the present and future naval rotary wing aircraft for safe landings.  The NGVLA is being developed for forward fit into the DDG1000 class destroyers, with potential applications for other future surface combatants.  The major design objectives for the NGVLA are: improve reliability, reduce maintenance & manpower, meet specific requirements of the DDG1000 functionality, mounting configurations, power and controls, lower radar cross section, and meet Night Vision Device compatibility requirements.  Proposed performance parameters for the new NGVLA are expected to be available no earlier than October 1st.  This information will be sent to interested parties upon request.  
        An RFI for this system and notice of industry conference was previously sent out.  The industry conference was held on February, 2007.  This notice is being sent again to inform potential proposers that the scope of the effort has changed.  In addition to the previously described effort, an additional effort of integration to the ship, including physical mountings and Radar Cross section integration has been added.  Rather than just providing the hardware for the shipbuilder to integrate into the ship, the winning contractor of the solicitation will be part of a development Integrated Product Team (IPT).  The IPT is anticipated to include an integration design development of the lighting fixtures and MFD into the Radar Cross section (RCS) design of the ship and meet all RCS budget and installation requirements.  The SGSI contract will not include RCS integration requirements.  The NGVLA program will reflect a system?level acquisition approach for three new components of the total system, which will each be contracted separately.  The Navy?s goal is to develop and procure an entire NGVLA system (Multi-Function Display (MFD), new Stabilized Glideslope Indicator (SGSI), and a new Flight Deck Lighting (FDL) system with associated interfaces.).  Contracts for each component development, logistics data development and test are anticipated with follow-on options for production quantities and Logistics support.  The government intends to structure a program that is economically feasible while meeting the needs of the fleet.  This may result in the contractor(s) pricing out one or more of the NGVLA components as a Modified COTS option.  The SGSI is composed of a stabilized optical projector which projects Green-Yellow-Red beams of light corridors for pilots to receive a visual cue of correct glide slope.   The pilots will receive pulse coded signals for the proper glide slope approach path.  The MFD consists of a ?bill-board? type display mounted on the ship?s superstructure above the hangar doors.  The MFD will present a horizon reference bar and deck status indication, as well as an ASSIST system indication with capability for future expansion.  The FDL is composed of all of the deck lighting and other approach and obstruction indicators required for US Navy aviation certification.  All of the control for power, brightness/dimming, fault indication, and status display will be interfaced through the ships Total Ships Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI ) system.   Operator control functions will be provided by the ship?s CEDS displays.  Interface to the ships data distribution for control and power interface will be specified by the shipbuilder and referenced in the respective component specifications.  The development effort is anticipated to be conducted through an Integrated Product Team (IPT) structure.  The IPT will consist of the contractor/ NGVLA component designer, the ship builder and NAWC Lakehurst NGVLA team members.  The first phase to be executed is the Development phase.  During the Development phase, contractors will develop program plans, develop and produce the System Development & Demonstration SDD hardware and support documentation, and test to prove compliance with specification requirements.

<DESC>This is a follow-up Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The Government previously sought information regarding the ability of potential suppliers to meet a Fischer-Tropsch draft synthetic fuel specification and suppliers' current and future production capability.  For this RFI, the Department of Defense is interested in whether potential domestic suppliers would require long term contracts and what specific terms and conditions would be included in those contracts.

PROCESS
This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining contract terms and conditions for the manufacture and supply of aviation synthetic fuel which would meet the attached draft specification.  Interested parties should answer the following questions and provide the requested information:

1.  Please provide a copy of your standard terms and conditions for a long term contract.  Provide copies of any special terms that would be in addition to standard terms.
2.  Would you require a long term arrangement in order to enter into a Government contract for synthetic fuel?  What would the minimum and maximum length of the contract be?
3.  The Government currently cannot enter into a contract for synthetic fuel longer than five years, although the contract could contain options for an additional five years.  If the Government cannot obtain longer term contract authority, would you be willing to enter into a five year contract?  Would the five year contract be more attractive if it contained options for an additional five years?  What would be the consequences of a five year contract in terms of price, risk, or any other payment or contract term?
4.  Some responses to the previous RFI referred to the need for offtake agreements.  Would you require an offtake agreement?  If the Government only needed jet fuel, would an offtake agreement require the Government to take all the products produced at the facility?  Would you require that the Government purchase some minimum quantity from the facility?
5.  Some responses to the previous RFI referred to take or pay arrangements.  Please advise if you would require a take or pay agreement and explain exactly how it would work.  What would be the financial consequence if the Government terminated for convenience a take or pay agreement?
6.  The Government currently has the right under its contracts to terminate a contract for the convenience of the Government.  In the event of such a termination, a contractor has the right to submit a claim for termination costs, which are generally the unrecovered costs under the contract.  Please advise whether a termination for convenience clause would be compatible with an offtake agreement or a take or pay agreement.
7.  How would a long term contract be priced?  Would it be fixed price or a cost contract?  Would it contain an escalation provision?  If the contract did contain an escalation provision, would that provision be based on a jet fuel market reference or would it be tied to some other market?  Would the escalation clause be based on cost inputs?  The Government would prefer a fixed price contract, priced per gallon, with some type of market escalator.
8.  Would the contract price require some floor price?  How would this be determined?  Would it include a ceiling price?
9.  What type of payment terms would be required?  Would any advance or progress payments be required while a facility is being constructed?  Or would payment only be made when fuel is delivered to the Government on a per gallon of fuel?
10.  Are there any special risk terms which would be needed?
11.  Please provide some basic information about your existing or proposed facilities:
     a.  Location of plant(s).
     b.  Size in barrels per day.
     c.  Since the Government preference is to purchase blended product, advise on your ability to blend up to 50% Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuel with conventional fuel, and advise whether blending would be done on or off site.
     d.  Ability to provide blended Fischer-Tropsch synthetic fuel containing all of the Government's required additives; i.e., Antioxidant, Static Dissipator Additive, Fuel System Icing Inhibitor, Corrosion Inhibitor/Lubricity Improver?
12.  Company point of contact, address, telephone number, email address, and size and status of the company; i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to solicit for purchase of 200 each, AC Surge Protector, Kalgo P/N Mini-II; NSN:  5920-01-358-5235, ASN:  C460-2.  These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO.  The Kalglo Mini-II AC Surge Protector is an integral component of the NWS?s Surface Instrumentation Program. The unique feature is this surge protector is that it provides Bi-polar and Bi-directional surge energy protection in both directions of AC circuit power isolation.  Its response time is also important for protecting instrumentation that operates in an outdoor environment, and thus, must meet line suppression voltage ratings of 400 Volts Peak at 500 Amperes with a surge rating of 6,000 Volts.  This device is extensively used throughout the Surface Instrumentation Program across multiple equipment platforms, and is therefore included in equipments? configuration control drawings and is logistically supported for equipment mutually served by this device.  To acquire any other surge protector other than the Kalglo Mini-II Model would require recertification of equipment already certified to operate with this device and will also require extensive and costly documentation updates to the Government. The costs associated with such a change cannot be recovered by open competition for similar devices. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of 41 USC 253? (1). The company is Kalglo Electronics Co., Inc., 5911 Colony Drive, Bethlehem, PA 18017-9348.  However, all proposals received within 7 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Kalglo Electronics Co. Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.  Interested firms should submit its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified switch that provides the same fit, form and function as that specified. Any responses that  provide for a part other than that specified must be accompanied by descriptive literature and certified test results that show it meets the same form, fit and function of the part number specified (P/N Mini-II).

<SUBJECT>70 -- Juniper Hardware
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? Juniper ISG-2000 Firewall to support the current USPTO enterprise firewall architecture.  

The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 requires all Federal agencies secure their information systems and identifies specific requirements with which agencies must comply in order to achieve that end.  The Department of Commerce has addressed these FISMA requirements in its IT Security Program Policy and Minimum Implementation Standards and USPTO must be compliant with that policy.  

The current USPTO enterprise firewall architecture was designed to support the USPTO Image File Wrapper project. Since then, the USPTO?s firewall requirements have changed to support an expanding ?trusted user? population, which consists of teleworkers, authorized contractors, and government partners.
With the increasing demand for remote access and the availability, the current firewall (FW) and Single Socket Layer Virtual Private Network (SSLVPN) architecture needs to be adjusted to an increase of USPTO?s Internet bandwidth to the Optical Carrier ? 3 (OC-3) level.  A market survey was conducted to determine the best available firewall and how each of them satisfies our requirements.  The ISG-2000 firewalls from Juniper Networks was determined   the best product with high performance based on the percentage of the requirements that it meets satisfactorily.  

This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) among the existing USPTO Information Technology ID/IQ contractors.  No written solicitation will be issued as a result.  The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Connie Lum at (571)272-4167, or via E-mail at connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Nortel Hardware
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? Nortel hardware to support the current USPTO Enterprise Trusted User Firewall (ETU-FW).  

The Enterprise Trusted User Firewall (ETU-FW) requires server switches and the Nortel 5500-series switch provides the exact capability needed for layer two switching within the ETU design. The 5530 switch provides multiple 1-gigabit and 10-gigabit connections that will give the ETU firewall design flexibility for future expansion and throughput requirements. The 5530 switch is also IPv6 compliant at the layer 2 level. 

The USPTO has installed 220 Nortel Passport switches to support the PTOnet infrastructure made a large investment in deploying network equipment manufactured by Nortel Networks.  Integrating another vendor?s network switches would require extensive lab testing, updating System Development Life Cycle documentation, establish and manage new maintenance contracts and conduct training for Network Operations staff.  In addition, introducing other switch vendor would complicate network troubleshooting which could result in longer network outages.

This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) among the existing USPTO Information Technology ID/IQ contractors.  No written solicitation will be issued as a result.  The point of contact for information regarding this notice is Connie Lum at (571)272-4167, or via E-mail at connie.lum@uspto.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- RedHat Software
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure the ?brand name? RedHat Linux Operating System software product.  

RedHat Linux OS has already been deployed successfully in a variety of projects in our IT lab and production environment to support our Tier 1 (Load Balancing and HTTP) environments.  USPTO has chosen RedHat Linux OS as our preferred standard Linux OS platform and has invested greatly in training our support staff and hiring more support engineers.  The supporting infrastructure to provide patch management, OS software deployment and baseline management are specifically for the RedHat OS.  

RedHat OS is an alternative to the more proprietary commercial Unix Operating Systems such as IBM-AIX or HP-UX, both of which we use today in our production servers and in the lab. Moreover these two commercial OS can not be used on the commodity, Intel based hardware and they work only on the IBM and HP specific hardware.  The only alternative to these commercial OS that can run on the Intel based commodity, cost effective hardware is the Linux Operating system.  

Even though there are several flavors of the Linux OS such as SuSE, Debian and RedHat, we at PTO chose RedHat Linux because of the support man power and resources we currently have.   The Linux operating system software is free, open source Operating system; however, for support in the production environment, USPTO must purchase a support subscription from a value added provider such as RedHat.

This announcement is considered a ?brand name? justification.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) among the existing USPTO Information Technology ID/IQ contractors.

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement: Research and Development - Tactics Software
<DESC>N61331-BAA-08-01:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) conducts research and development of techniques and technologies directed toward operations in a littoral environment in support of expeditionary warfare and coastal operations. NSWC PC’s mission includes mine warfare (both mine countermeasures (MCM) and mining). Typical functions include fundamental research; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; logistics; and development of operational concepts and tactics. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)2. It is intended that this BAA be open for one year from the date of publication of t he announcement.  NSWC PC is interested in receiving proposals for algorithms and potential subsequent software implementation providing automation and optimization of specific aspects of established MCM tactics and doctrine. These software products would be employed in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), readily allowing their interface with existing MIW databases (e.g. MCM equipment performance data, platform mine susceptibility data, environmental (oceanographic) data, threat mine performance data), and existing and yet to be developed MCM tactical decision aid software.   The specific area of interest is the automated definition of optimized geometries (transit routes, MCM work areas, Fleet operating areas) within an area of interest.   The desired output of the algorithm and software will be a complete definition of the optimal geometries and a quantitative scoring method to compare software derived and baseline (manually produced) routes.  Parameters to be used include the following: a.  Boundaries of the operational area. b.  Route starting and ending points. c.  Operational areas (anchorages, fire support areas, platform staging areas). d.  Mine hunting conditions. e.  Mine sweeping conditions. f.   Risk to transiting ships. g.  Time for the preparation (mine hunting, mine neutralization, mine sweeping) of the route and operating areas. h.  Performance characteristics and quantities of available MCM equipment. i.   Expected threat mines to be encountered. j.  Minimum route segment length. k.  Minimum and maximum turn angles. Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, Institution of higher education (other than federal government) with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such entities. NSWC PC encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be: (1) funded incrementally for periods up to three years subject to the availability of appropriations; (2) on average, be funded between $10,000 to $150,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic (although NSWC PC  reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds); (3) more than one effort may be funded for an individual topic; (4) NSWC PC  is not interested in concepts that already have been developed or proven (even if they never have been sold before); (5) NSWC PC  is seeking proposals for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding; and (6) deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation rather than focus on a specific system or hardware solution. Proposals for evolutionary engineering of improvements are inappropriate u!  nder BAA authority and are not allowed. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as an initial step, interested parties should submit concept or  white  papers briefly summarizing the technical direction, relevance and scope of the proposed effort, and a brief synopsis of qualifications based on accomplishments, and provide a rough order of magnitude cost. White papers should be no more than 5-7 pages in length. White papers (and any resulting proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential naval relevance and contributions of the effort to NSWC PC specific mission areas; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to NSWC PC  programs are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered to NSWC PC with unrestricted !  (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offerors capabilities, related ex perience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; (6) Realism of the proposed cost and the availability of funds. Based on evaluation of the White papers, participants may be selected and invited to submit full technical and cost proposals for evaluation by NSWC PC using the above noted evaluation criteria. An invitation to submit a full proposal does not guarantee funding. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. For efforts funded as legally binding commitments, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned sm!  all business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities. This is to notify potential proposers that each grant or cooperative agreement that may be placed under this announcement or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents, the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to directory information pertaining to students. If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, !  the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreeme nt and all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements, and it may suspend or terminate such grants and agreements unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.  If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any grant, including any existing grant; (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a grant or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation. Proposals may be submitted by any commercial firm, or institution of higher education. There is no longer a requirement that the entity be U.S. in origin.  White papers may be submitted any time prior to expiration of the BAA. There is no set date for submission.

STATEMENT OF WORK

BACKGROUND:  The USAF Counterproliferation Center (CPC) was established by the CSAF in 1998 and was officially opened for business at Air University, Maxwell AFB AL, in February of 1999.  The CPC?s mission is to provide education and research to the present and future leaders of the USAF and better prepare these leaders to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  As part of this mission, CPC hosts a distinguished lecture series and brings in speakers for courses for students at AU; these lecturers are also available to small groups of interested AU staff and faculty.  Another significant contribution to this mission is the USAF Counterproliferation Center?s annual conference, an event that brings an ever-expanding combating WMD community together effectively in one place.  The CPC also conducts workshops on other U.S. national security issue topics.  These workshops include a cross section of speakers and attendees from in and outside the government.

OBJECTIVE:  To assist the CPC in improving the US national security by educating senior military officers and other DOD leaders on counterproliferation and associated national security topics and issues and assist the CPC in conferences and workshops to contribute to the mission of reducing the dangers from adversaries equipped with or seeking weapons of mass destruction.

SCOPE:  This statement of work defines work tasks including: educate faculty/students attending professional military education (PME) schools on U.S. national security and provide subject matter and technical expertise to conferences and workshops.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

	a.  Support to PME core and elective courses dealing with profiles, strategic cultures, sources of support, and U.S./Allied countermeasures regarding states of concern or terrorist organizations.  These courses will examine the leadership and strategic cultures of a wide range of state and non-state actors who currently present threats to the security and/or interests of the United States and its allies.  Additionally, these courses will examine the leaders and strategic cultures of terrorist organizations, as well as the rulers and strategic cultures of current and potential adversary states.

	b.  Assist and provide subject matter expertise in executing conferences and workshops.  Conferences provide a national forum for senior leaders and other members of the combating WMD community to focus on the U.S. ability to wage war successfully against enemy forces using WMD.  Workshops support efforts to combat WMD threats issues, WMD threats and countermeasures, and strategic communications for combating WMD.  Efforts may include identification of other subject matter experts and government officials who should attend or participate in workshop/conference, coordination of program agenda, and analysis of material or reports.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-55, Request for Information on Subsurface to Surface Imaging
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - Subsurface-to-Surface Imaging


DESCRIPTION

Visible optics (i.e., 450 to 600 nm) imaging of objects located at or above the water surface from subsurface sensors is an extremely challenging problem.  The wind- and wave-driven deformation of the water-air interface is a major limitation to subsurface imagers, with degradation from surface refraction and scattering frequently resulting in unrecognizable image content.   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on novel research ideas and approaches to enable improved imaging from subsurface sensor systems that mitigates the distortions caused by the water/air interface.  Information is requested concerning the understanding of transmission and scattering phenomenology, and hardware and/or software approaches to successful imaging through the water-air interface.   No funding has currently been allocated to this effort.  A Broad Agency Announcement and/or other solicitation may or may not result from the findings of this RFI.

As light encounters the undulating water surface, some of it enters the water where it continues to be scattered and absorbed.  The image also abruptly acquires aberrations caused by refraction at the interface. The resulting image as taken by a subsurface camera is blurred, distorted, broken up and attenuated.  In order to reconstruct the image, physical techniques or algorithms must be developed to counter degradations such as those caused by anisoplanatism and multiple images.   

Responses of interest may address the following or other related topics:
1.	Image modeling through the water-air interface
o	sea state (gravity waves as well as capillary waves)
o	surf zone effects
o	sensor depth
o	water/air properties 
o	apparent object elevation
o	chromatic aberration from wedge of water
o	resolution
2.	Experimental observation of wave behavior as it affects visible optics imaging
o	small-scale slope statistics with particular attention to capillary waves
3.	Image reconstruction approaches suitable for improved imaging through the water-air interface
o	hardware approaches such as adaptive optics
o	deconvolution algorithms
o	phase diversity
o	lucky images
o	image mosaicing
o	image patch techniques
4.	Polarization effects
o	multiple looks
o	obtaining surface-shape information
o	diagnosing scattering
5.	Environmental estimation
o	small-scale water/surface/air modeling and prediction
o	wave prediction
o	optics of capillary waves
6.	Innovative sensor designs
o	precise, real-time mapping of the interface shape over the entrance pupil
o	minimizing anisoplanatism
o	adaptive optics for distortion-dominated images
o	fusing information from a non-optical sensor
o	an optional list of citations including URLs if available;

The above should be submitted as MS Word, PDF, and/or MS PowerPoint documents.
Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while at the same time providing actionable insight. 

Respondents must submit one original and four paper copies of the full response and one electronic copy of the full RFI response (in Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF, and/or Microsoft PowerPoint on a single CD ROM). Disks must be clearly labeled with RFI SN07-55, offeror organization, and points of contact. The full RFI response (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to: DARPA/STO, Attn: Dr. Jennifer Ricklin, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. Responses to this Request for Information (RFI) are due no later than 4:00pm, Local Time, Arlington, VA, on 5 November  2007. ANY INQUIRIES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION MUST BE SUBMITTED TO RFI-SN07-55@darpa.mil NO TELEPHONIC INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>D -- Passport Applications Support
<DESC>The Department of State intends to issue a follow-on sole-source award to L-3 Communications Titan Corporation located at 11955 Freedom Drive, 10th Floor, Reston, VA 20190 for Help Desk support services of the customized suite of passport applications at the 17 Passport Agencies and 3 processing centers located throughout the United States.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  This action is being taken to provide continuity of services upon the expiration of the current task order which expires September 18, 2007 and will allow for the negotiation and award of the follow-on competitive contract.  Use of another contractor during this period would result in the disruption of services and would necessitate costly start-up and transition costs.  A halt in service to any of the applications that support the issuance of passports would prove extraordinarily costly to the U.S. Government and to the U.S. citizens with intentions of traveling outside the country.  The proposed award will be issued off the vendor GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The estimated cost of this prospective award is $765,000 (USD) with a period of performance of six months.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  This is for informational purposes only; please contact the primary point of contact on this announcement via e-mail to submit any inquiries.

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) Industry Day Conference
<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE:

DARPA/TTO will host an Industry Day Conference in support of the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed (FAST) program (BAA 07-65) on October 2, 2007 at Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., 3811 Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia, 22203 from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  Registration begins at 8:00 a.m. and the conference will start promptly at 9:00 a.m.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the FAST program; promote additional discussion on this topic; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the FAST program is to develop a revolutionary approach to spacecraft high power generation.  This High Power Generation Subsystem (HPGS), when combined with electric propulsion, will form the technological basis for a light weight, high power, high mobility spacecraft platform.  The current means to achieve mobility on orbit involves relatively low specific impulse chemical mono- and bipropellants.  These stored energy systems require relatively high propellant mass to achieve significant maneuverability.  The FAST program will demonstrate the implementation of solar concentrators and high flux solar cells in conjunction with high specific impulse electric propulsion, to produce a lightweight power and propulsion system capable of delivering persistent maneuverability on-orbit.  

The FAST system can form the basis for a paradigm-shift in spacecraft mission design, enabling an affordable launch to LEO with self-transfer to GEO, while retaining sufficient maneuverability in GEO to perform flexible mission scenarios including numerous sorties.   The FAST system is intended to enable responsive on-orbit servicing architectures, on-orbit space situational awareness capabilities, and high power payloads such as communications or radar.

The Government envisions a two phase development program with potential for a follow-on program to perform an on-orbit demonstration of the FAST system.  Phase 1 will consist of the completion of a detailed prototype design for ground test demonstration, along with a full simulation of the HPGS performance, including solar concentration, power conversion, heat rejection, structure and deployment, along with sun pointing and tracking capability.  Phase 2 will include the fabrication, assembly and end-to-end testing of the prototype HPGS in a representative environment.  Multiple awards for simultaneous execution of Phase 1 by competing Contractor teams are expected.  

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than September 25, 2007 at the following website:  https://enstg.com/signup/passthru.cfm?ConferenceCode=FAS38626.   The conference code is FAS38626.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Due to space limitations of the conference facility, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants, and no more than TWO representatives per organization.  Organizations are strongly encouraged to limit these representatives to no more than one business development person and should include at least one chief engineer or technical lead who can participate in technical discussions. The October 2nd Industry Day conference will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Registration is restricted to US citizens and Permanent Resident Aliens only.  Proof of Citizenship or Permanent Resident Status (forms found on the registration website) must be provided no later than September 25, 2007.  Please fax the US Proof of Citizenship or the DARPA Form 60, Foreign National Visit Request, to:  Hugo Castellon, Booz Allen Hamilton, fax 703-816-5444. 

Additionally, attendees will be able to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, and/or discuss teaming opportunities in an industry only forum.  No Government personnel will be present during this time.  Upon arrival, the attendees will receive their scheduled time for presenting.  The opportunity to present will be afforded on a first come, first served basis.  It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all proposed sensitive or unclassified material is reviewed prior to being displayed at the conference by the organization that funded the research.  Presentations may contain up to 10 slides and are limited to ten (10) minutes.  There will be no exceptions to this requirement.  Proposers desiring to present at the Industry Day Conference should send an electronic copy of all material to be presented to BAA07-65@darpa.mil as soon as possible, but no later than September 25, 2007.

In the event that there is a discrepancy between information posted here and on www.fbo.gov, the FedBizOpps site takes precedence.

<SUBJECT>--RSHR-74TJAR Elan RC system for rats and guinea pigs.
<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to Buxco Electronics, Inc., 219 Station Rd, Ste 202, Wilmington, NC 28405, on a sole source basis, for the purchase of Elan RC highly-integrated collection system for rats and guinea  pigs.   See Sole Source below.   This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is  not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the r equirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is :  lottie.morris@amedd.army.mil. Sole Source Justification IAW FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source For Buxco Electronics, Inc item: RSHR-74TJAR - Élan RC system for rat and guinea pig  1. You must state the specific uses of the item. What is this item going to do? Essential, basic, requirements that the item will perform. Buxcos ÉLAN Series Each station includes everything needed to study respiratory toxicity immediately after exposure to toxins. " Plethysmograph, " Flow transducer, " Pressure transducer, " Esophageal reference, " Blood pressure transducer, " Preamplifier,  " Analog-to-digital converter, " Respiration pump, " Software-driven aerosol control, " In-line aerosol components]. All are arranged on one platform to reduce bench space requirements and to minimize cables and tubing. ÉLAN Series RC systems are easily e xpanded for high through-put use by adding additional stations. Each station requires just one power outlet and one USB computer connection. ÉLAN Series RC stations are designed to work with BioSystem XA Version 2.10 and later. The acquisition software est ablishes a specialized site for ÉLAN Series stations, with many settings and controls preconfigured.  2. What are the unique characteristics of this item.  Why will only this item work. (Are you attaching this item to an existing system?, is this an upgrade to an existing software item or is this maintenance to a system and the contractor has proprietary r ights to the system?  Be specific in these areas. Some notable features include:  1) Pre-amplification, aerosol control, analog-to-digital conversion, and a ventilator are all housed in one small case.  2) The ventilator is software-controlled and can be operated in a volumetric or pressure mode. software-settable PEEP is supplied.  3) The Élan Series plethysmographs are supplied with a heated bed for maintaining the anesthetized animal's body temperature.  4) Flow and pressure calibrations are automated and preamplifier gains are automatically set.  5) Each Élan site communicates to the computer via a USB connection. Power connections for each site may be daisy-chained to other sites, reducing the number of power outlets required.  6) Additional sites may be easily added at any time.  7) Élan sites are equipped to measure resistance and compliance of ventilated or spontaneously-breathing animals.  8) Élan sites offer an option for monitoring blood pressure or ECG of the anesthetized subject.  This item can be attached to our currently using BUXCO plethysmography system for high-throughput use. The system can also use parts such as computer and software from the currently using system if there is any malfunction.  The system can also be used wit h our radiotelemetry equipment from Data Sciences International.  Buxco holds U.S. patents on the unrestrained whole body plethysmograph and the Halcyon" low noise pneumotachograph design. They are also the exclusive supplier of four channe l independently flow-controlled bias-flow pumps. 3. Impact:  What would be the impact to your program/mission if a different Mfg. Or widget were to be purchased. (Cost to reinvent an established process, previous studies would not be valid if the same system/technique were used). Also any non-recoverable  costs. (Cost, Time, Delay in approval (i.e., FDA), FDA approval required data to acquire or substantiate using same testing equipment). The ELAN series RC stations are released to the public during the American Thoracic Society meeting in May 2007 at San Francisco. It is available only from BUXCO. WRAIR does not have any equipment to determine respiratory functional toxicity after exposure  to toxin or therapeutic treatment. Studies show that respiratory toxicity following exposure to chemical and biological agents are different from systemic toxicity and requires separate treatment and aerosolized treatment is critical (Taysse et al., 2005) , (Wong et al., 2007; Vogel et al., 1996). We have used other BUXCO instruments previously and found the products are of superior quality in determining respiratory abnormalities. Market research has shown that there is no system similar to Elan RC system currently available from any manufacturer. We looked at PSE Systems and EMKA Co..  Neither can provide an immediate check for toxicity which BUXCO can do and is a critical capability in our studies. Also, if a system with a different manufacturer is used, it cannot be connected to our currently used BUXCO plethysmography system resulting in under usage of the functions of the system.  Elan RC system can also be used with our Data sciences International radiotelemetry system to complete the ongoing projects.  Previously generated data with BUXCO plethysmography cannot be compared with the new experiments if a different system is used and this would result in repetition of many experiments and interruption of the project. 4. Market Research:  You must do market research of other systems/items/services/etc. and you must give the results, such as what other systems/items did you look at, what/who did you talk to, pricing and what was the reason why you did not select their sy stem/item?  BUXCO is the only company that produces ELAN Series RC highly-integrated collection station. Market Research did not show a product with this feature from any other company icluding PSE Systems and EMKA Co. Selection of BUXCO would also result in purchase of equipments that can be cross connected to the currently used BUXCO plethysmography equipment for high-throughput purposes. The software and the computer can be inter-exchanged and used if there is a malfunction in any equipment. The Elan RC system can a lso be used with our radiotelemetry equipment from Data Sciences International for electrocardiogram and blood pressure measurement that is required for the project work and result in a significant savings to the government. The size of the Elan system is small and can save significant animal laboratory space. BUXCO has the original patent on the product. Other companies might be using BUXCO parts for different purposes. Also I did not see any products similar to ELAN RC produced by any company in all meeti ngs I attended that suit our research purposes. So we request that they be accepted as sole-source for this purchase. Madhusoodana P. Nambiar Principal Investigator APPROVED Sole Source  AARON J. WADE Contracting Officer

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
UNITED STATES COAST GUARD
OFFICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT (CG-3RPL)
OFFICE OF COUNTERTERRORISM & SPECIAL MISSIONS OPERATIONS (CG-3RPC)

Coast Guard Judgmental Use of Force Evaluation
(Person to Person & Mounted Automatic Weapon)


1.0	PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1.1	An updated version of the Coast Guard Judgmental Use of Force Evaluation (CGJUFE) scenarios are needed to replace the existing 1995 (still in use) evaluation scenarios to reflect current requirements.  Additionally, development of Boat to Boat scenarios for use with Mounted Automatic Weapons (MAW) is necessary.

1.2	By revising and developing the Judgmental Pistol Course (JPC) and MAW evaluation scenarios, further referred to in this statement of work as the (JUFE), the Coast Guard (CG) will provide personnel with current and adequate use of force scenarios for purposes of orientation, readiness, and safety in the conduct of all Coast Guard law enforcement and security operations involving person to person and boat to boat encounters where the members Use of Force (UOF) and Standing Rules of Engagement (SROE) knowledge of CG policies, and individual actions can be safely evaluated.


2.0	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service in Albany California has a requirement for one TrackSphere Locomotion Compensator. Model LC-100, for use in insect semiochemicals laboratory bioassays.  This requirement is intended to be a Sole Source award with Syntech Equipment and Research, Hansjakobstrasse 14 79199 Kirchzarte Germany. The Model LC-100 consists of a sphere, on top of which the insect is placed, and which is rotated opposite to the insect?s displacements by means of two electric motors.  The motors are driven by electrical commands proportional to the movement-behavior (e.g., attraction) or displacement of the insect measured by an optical detector located above the insect.  Two encoders orthogonally contacting the sphere transmit the rotational movements to a Controller or computer circuit, where the displacements are stored as incremental X and Y coordinates.  The instrument can be used for a wide range of orientation experiments, including attraction bioassays to Kairomone we intend to conduct.  This LC-100 TrackSphere Locomotion Compensator allows manipulation of the insect?s environment over long periods and in an unlimited virtual area.  Although the method is straightforward and very attractive as a research tool it is not widely applied because of the complicated construction, difficult operation, and high cost. The design of the Syntech LC-100 has been optimized with: 1) size of the sphere is limited to 300 mm resulting in a light and compact construction, 2) sphere is supported by an aerostatic spherical bearing, which is noiseless and easy to clean, 3) displacement detector is based on a CMOS video sensor followed by a digital signal processor eliminating the need for a reflector on the insect. 4) only two parameters in the feedback loop between detector and motor drives need to be adjusted by the operator, the feedback gain and the time constant of the feedback response, and 5) a real-time video display facilitates focusing the displacement sensor and proper adjustment of the illumination (Infrared and visible).

<DESC>We request an 8-Chamber Multiplexed System for soil CO2 flux measurements.  System components include the Analyzer Control Unit, Multiplexer, and Long-Term Chambers.  The 8-Chamber Multiplexed System must be designed to take unattended, long-term, sequential soil CO2 measurements at up to 8 different locations and to investigate soil moisture, soil temperature, precipitation events, and photosynthetically active radiation that affect soil CO2 rates.  The system must operate in temperature ranges from -20C to 45C allowing for a lengthy field season.  The long term chambers must have a volume of 4.03 liters and cover 317 cm2 soil area; the chambers move away from the measurement area when not in use to minimize microclimate variability inside the collar. 

The required features for the 8-Chamber Multiplexed System:

1. Chamber pressure control.  When the soil chamber is placed on the soil collar to take soil CO2 measurements, an increase in head-space pressure occurs.  The increase in air pressure results in an artificial air-pressure gradient that reduces CO2 efflux out of soil into the chamber headspace.  The result is an error in the measurement, and this error is very difficult to quantify.
The specially designed vent function ensures that  measured FCO2  accurately represents the rate occurring outside the chamber. 


2. Good Mixing inside the chamber.  Air movement in the head-space of a chamber can influence measured soil surface CO2 efflux rates by creating turbulence at the soil surface. This turbulence can increase measured efflux rates. However, it is also critical that air within the chamber be adequately mixed (homogenous) so that periodic (~every 5 seconds) sampling and analysis of head-space CO2 concentration accurately describe CO2 concentration in the whole chamber. 

3. Multiple Chambers.  Spatial variability in soil surface CO2 efflux is large, which requires an investigator to take multiple measurements.  With the 8-chamber multiplexed system, timely spatial comparisons can be made over a large area to investigate heterogeneities within the soil subsurface.  The rugged equipment design must allow for flexibility in the location of the soil CO2 measurements with minimal unnatural disturbance to the study area. 

4. Leak test.  It is essential to be able to test if the system is performing adequately after initial set-up and throughout the course of the study to ensure high quality date is produced.  The associated software allows for a user controlled leak test of each chamber and a trouble shooting feature if a leak is detected.

5. Spectral interference.  Both CO2 and H2O water absorb infra-red wavelengths of light. Traditional systems for measuring soil surface CO2 efflux have either ignored this interference or have developed and applied general corrections for H2O interference for an average water vapor content. Where general corrections are applied, error can still result especially as water vapor content diverges from the assumed average value (for example, after rain or prolonged drought). This problem would be solved if a soil respiration system could simultaneously measure both CO2 efflux and water vapor, such that each measurement is corrected for water vapor content of chamber head-space. 

6. Exponential curve fitting.  The initial CO2 increase rate is estimated based on exponential curve fitting to minimize the impact of the change in CO2 gradient inside the chamber on the flux measurement.

7.	Multiple interfacing systems.  The design needs to allow for flexibility in placement of the system in the field.  Multiple interfacing tools are required to compliment the flexibility by allowing the system to be fully operated with a laptop, PDA or independently through an internal key-pad and CPU. 

8. The government estimate is $35,000.00 to $40,000.00

9. Delivery ARO is 30 Days

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

P.       EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  The Government does reserve the right to make multiple awards. The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance.  Technical and Management Plan is more important than Past Performance.  When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoters best terms. 

Technical and Management Plan: The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm.  The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing.  The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan .The plan shall describe the quoters personnel and administrative management approach, with respect to the managing corporate office?s geographic location and how it plans to effectively manage on-site personnel (i.e. supervision, disciplinary actions, etc.) and administrative matters.  The personnel and administrative management approach must sufficiently demonstrate the quoters capabilities in taking an active role in the day to day supervision, management, and administrative tasks for on-site personnel.   

The plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describe contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government.  The technical and management plan shall also include a brief description of firm?s contingency and continuity of operations plans in the event of natural or manmade disasters that may disrupt service capabilities (A full blown continuity of operations plan (COOP) is not required).  

For the purposes of this requirement, contractor personnel are not considered ?Key Personnel? as prescribed by HSAR Clause 3052.215-70.  However, DHS does reserve the right to review resumes prior to individual placement.  
Past Performance:   The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.   Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.   Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.   Please include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project;  c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/ Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.

Price:     The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for each proposed labor category for the base period and for each option period.  The United States Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determination No: 05-2103 Rev No. 3 (Effective 05/29/2007) is incorporated into this solicitation.  Secretary Levels IV and V shall be provided to reflect the current U.S. DOL Wage Determination, provided herein, as Administrative Assistant - No. 01020.  The DOL Wage Determination may be viewed in detail at http://www.dol.gov.  

The technical quote submission shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.) and the past performance section shall be limited to 2 one-sided pages (also inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.)     The price quote has no page limitations.  All quotes should be provided with a cover page and table of contents for both the Technical and the Price sections.  No pricing information is to be provided within the quoter?s technical quote.  The font for submissions shall be set at Arial [no smaller than] 11 with 1 inch margins.  All responses shall be submitted in MS Word.  

Q.       SUBMISSION OF QUOTE

Although many other needs are also being met, the program focuses on building vocational skills, developing academic skills and increasing awareness of social skills and core values.

Besides educational and vocational opportunities, trainees receive free housing, meals, medical and dental care, as well as living and clothing allowances.  There are daily recreational activities and outings scheduled weekly for all trainees who wish to participate.  Counseling services are available to assist trainees with their individual needs.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

FAR 13.501, Test Program for Commercial Items, section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.

US Army Garrison (USAG) Schweinfurt?s Local Area Network (LAN) primarily consists of Foundry Inc. Ethernet Layer 2 and 3 switches. This requirement will add additional Ethernet switches to the network and replace existing obsolete, unsupportable and unmanageable switches such as Cabletron Inc.  US Army Europe (USAREUR)/5th Signal Command monitors and manages all USAG LANs in the European theater as one large Enterprise Wide Area Network (WAN).  All network management and monitoring functions to include USAG Schweinfurt?s LAN are performed centrally by USAREUR/5th Signal Command at Network Operation Centers (NOCs).  USAREUR/5th Signal Command uses Foundry Inc. proprietary network management and monitoring software called Iron View Network Manager (INM). Foundry INM software supports sFlow which is embedded in each of the Foundry Ethernet switches.  The combination of Foundry INM and sFlow allows USAREUR/5th Signal Command to have full visibility of all network switches and perform continuous monitoring and analysis of network traffic.  This visibility allows USAREUR/5th Signal Command to fully centrally manage the entire WAN.

If USAG Schweinfurt were to place non Foundry Ethernet switches on their LAN, USAREUR/5th Signal Command would loose the ability to manage USAG Schweinfurt?s Local Area Network (LAN) and essentially disconnect it from the management of the European theater enterprise network.  The costs to replace all equipment with another brand name so as to maintain the enterprise level management would exceed $15,000,000.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

A combined synopsis solicication will be posted to FedBizOpps.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of the equipment that have to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

Market research indicates there are multiple resellers of Foundry equipment.  Research found the following companies:

1. PacStar, 15055 SW Sequoia Pkwy. #100, Portland, OR 97224, 001-503.403.3000, Toll Free: 888.872.1512

2. Foundry Networks Inc., Corporate Headquarters: Santa Clara, CA 95054, 1-408.207.1700, Toll free: 888.TURBOLAN (888.887.2652)

3. CDW-G, Corporate Headquarters, 230 N. Milwaukee Ave.
Vernon Hills, IL 60061, 001- 847.371.5600

The research that produced the overarching solution for the Life Cycle Management Program included an evaluation of multiple technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included Foundry and CISCO.  The evaluation considered the personal experiences of 8 personnel, a review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, a review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule pricing.  Based on the evaluation an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the Foundry product line.  

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAG Schweinfurt area of responsibility.

10.  Listing of Interested sources:
 
1. PacStar, 15055 SW Sequoia Pkwy. #100, Portland, OR 97224, 001-503.403.3000, Toll Free: 888.872.1512

Oral proposals are not acceptable.     All FAR/DFAR clauses can be obtained at www.far.npr.gov & http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFFARa.htm).   Local clauses can be found in the Disa Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DARS) at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp. No numbered notes apply.  Brand Name Justification is as follows:
BRAND NAME DOCUMENTATION

1.  Identify the activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 

United States Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE)

2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 

Hewlett Packard network switches. 

3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the sole source acquisition.  Justify the use of one source.
If expertise is the basis for the brand name determination, structure the justification as follows: 

he network switches will be part of an existing operational Local Area Network (LAN) consisting of only Hewlett Packard devices. Purchasing HP switches ensures guaranteed compatibility with existing devices and management software tools. HP Procurve Manager management software is currently utilized and allows network managers to manage and monitor all aspects of the LAN. One important capability is the ability to install security patches to all network switch operating systems from a central console with just a few mouse clicks. This greatly enhances the ability to react to security vulnerabilities. While software from other vendors has similar capabilities, it would require replacing over 20 additional existing HP switches at an estimated cost of $60,000.00 to obtain the same level of functionality. This change in network switch brands would also require network downtime.

HP offers a lifetime warranty. HP offers next-business-day advance replacement, and phone and Web support at no additional cost. Software updates for HP ProCurve Networking products are available at no extra charge, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for as long as you own the product. Other brands such as Cisco Systems charge for this service.  Based solely on 20 networks switches, the government (USAMMCE) will avoid costs of approximately $16K during the 5 year life cycle by choosing the HP brand switch.

LAN administrators are already trained on managing these devices. Switching to a different vendor would require additional training.  

4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for sole source procurement?

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDA’s mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agency’s mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet – a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDA’s program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agency’s requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the program’s mission.<BR><BR>

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-291 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 518210 with a size standard of $23.0M.  This is set-aside for Small Businesses.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure the services of a contractor that is able to launch a web-based Blood Glucose (BG) reporting system.  

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically usint allow for BG values to be directly downloaded from the various commercially available BG meters, and such manual data entry increases the chance for erroneous entries.

Purpose
The DB/NIDDK therefore wishes to partner with a company able to launch a web-based BG reporting system for use with future DB/NIDDK clinical trials.  


Objectives

1.	To capture all that data currently recorded in the DB Excel based system, and structured such that the patients and the health care team can use the data to communicate in secure environment re therapeutic strategies to improve glycemia control.
2.	For the BG readings in particular, the systems should support the electronic transfer of data directly from the BG meter into the web-based database. 
3.	For those BG meters that allow the patient to record meal-associated carbohydrate counts and associated insulin doses, (e.g. the OneTouch Ultrasmart monitor which already asks for the data), that data should also be appropriately downloaded into the web-based database.
4.	Establish systems for NIDDK investigators to download the captured data into a database file (like Excel) so that data can be analyzed freely by DB/NIDDK protocol investigators.
5.	Develop report screens suitable for clinical protocols, including a section for protocol participants to report adverse events.
6.	The system must satisfy current criteria for protecting patient confidentiality.
7.	The system must have appropriate backup systems to insure data will not be lost in the event of hardware system failure.
8.	The system need have the capacity to store data from up to 1000 patients, and including up to 10 years of data for each patient. 

The contractor shall:
Develop web based blood glucose reporting program, including procedures, timeline, training/education materials.
1.	Develop Plan of Action
2.	Identify relevant needs/objectives:  as specified above
i.	Coordinate with the Diabetes Branch of NIDDK to facilitate the incorporation of the necessary objectives into the final product.
3.	Provide training resources for the Diabetes Branch members who will be utilizing the system.
4.	Deliver a product that has been tested and ready to use in the clinical environment, adhering strictly to the current privacy and confidentially requirements. 
5.	Work with the researchers in NIDDK to modify the product once delivered.
6.	Provide continued product support.
7.	Contractor must be knowledgeable about current health care policies regarding privacy. 

Project Deliverables
a)	Plan of Action
b)	Key processes flowchart
c)	Training resources for the staff
d)	A web based blood glucose management program that meets the objectives as specified above
e)	Continued support and training for the program

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance of work will be based upon the review of the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  All deliverables and reports shall be inspected and approved by the Chief, Diabetes Branch, NIDDK.  Project completion will culminate upon receipt and approval of all deliverables and the project briefing to the Diabetes Branch Chief, David M. Harlan, M.D., Captain, U.S. Public Health Service, Building 10, CRC Room 5-5940, Bethesda, MD  20892.

Period and Place of Performance

The work for this project will be performed both onsite at NIDDK and offsite at the contractor?s office.  The period of performance will be Base Year plus Four (4) Option Years.  The first year is the base contract which will include the product development/testing and production/maintenance periods.

STATEMENT OF WORK


Background
The Diabetes Branch (DB) within the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases? (NIDDK) Division of Intramural Research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has conducted several immunotherapeutic trials for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and has plans for other trials to initiate soon.  For such trials, DB investigators collect data recorded by the patients including:
?	Multiple daily ?finger stick? blood glucose (BG) checks from each protocol participant, including:
o	The time of day the BG was checked, 
o	Whether the BG was obtained before or after a meal, or was due to symptoms prompting the BG check
o	For BG values that are either high, or low, whether that BG reading resulted in symptoms and the patient?s words describing those symptoms.
?	Carbohydrates consumed, and the time of that consumption.  For instance, carbohydrates might be consumed for meals or snacks, in response to a low blood sugar, or due to increased physical activity (i.e. in order to prevent a low that might be induced by exercise).
?	Insulin doses administered.  DB investigators train protocol participants to recognize the three reasons to administer insulin as:
o	Basal insulin- either via long-acting insulin injections or via an insulin pump
o	Meal associated insulin- typically using a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.
?	General comments including:
o	Exercise or other out-of-the-ordinary physical activity
o	Prescription medicines added to that individual?s regimen
o	Inter-current illnesses (likes colds or the flu) or other such unexpected ?stressors? that can influence glycemia control. 
o	For those using insulin pumps, a site to record infusion set changes.
o	When appropriate, a site to record vital signs, height, and weight.

That data is kept in a format easily understood by both protocol participants and study investigators, and is used as a tool to improve participant glycemia control.  Study investigators can also analyze the data for protocol outcomes.

The system we currently employ however has significant shortcomings including:
1.	Records are maintained in Excel-based files that are sent by e-mail between the patient and the DB team.  As such, the communication suffers from:
a.	Inadequate security re patient-record confidentiality, 
b.	With chronic use and ever increasing data, the files become quite large. 
c.	Patients must keep their records on their computer making the system less ?portable.?
2.	Data analysis using our current format, while achievable, is not accomplished easily.
3.	The current system does nog a preset insulin to carbohydrate ratio and
o	?Sliding scale? insulin- administered using an algorithm-based dosing scale when the BG is unexpectedly high.  This insulin is designed specifically to lower an elevated blood sugar whereas basal and meal-associated insulin is administered to prevent the BG from rising to abnormal levels.

Evaluation Factors for Award

General
Award of an order will be made to the vendor whose quotation is determined by the Government to represent the best overall value.  





Technical Evaluation 
The technical portion of your quotation is significantly more important than cost or price and will be receive paramount consideration for award.  The technical portion of your quotation will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria outlined below under ?Technical Evaluation Criteria?.  

The Government will evaluate the quality of the vendor?s past performance based on the information obtained from references provided by the vendor, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the vendor concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.

Technical Evaluation Criteria for Proposal

Please refer to the table at the end of this section for the scoring scheme that will be used to evaluate all proposals.  

A.	Security (17 points)

Provide a secure environment for patients to enter/download data and for patient-clinician communication.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the vendors experience in constructing secure websites for handling confidential data. 

B.	Blood Glucose Meter Data Download (17 points)

The vendor will be judged on experience with downloading data from multiple BG meters.  

C.	Website Design (17 points)

Provide clear and usable graphical interfaces for data entry by patients. Data includes numeric measurements and textual communication.  Proposals will be evaluated on general web programming experience and clarity in previous projects. Preference will be given to proposals demonstrating experience in diabetes-related clinical trial data.

D.	Data Extraction (17 points)

The vendor must demonstrate appropriate programming capability to enable the download of accumulated data to clinicians (fellows, nurse practitioners, and their supervisors) and investigators in appropriate formats.  
  
E.	Clinically-Oriented Reports & Graphs (6 points)

F.	Flexibility in Report Structure (6 points)

Special reports will be required to monitor the performance of individual care providers, display scientific data using particular search criteria, etc.  For example, we may need to know: (1) How often does doctor X correspond with his/her diabetic patients?  (2) How do patients followed by clinical team 1 do compared to patients followed by clinical team 2?  (3)  How many patients are being managed by each care provider?  These and other questions can be formulated only after we have experience with the system.  Therefore, the proposals will be evaluated based on the ability to develop and incorporate new reports.  The use of a standard report writer is preferred. 


G.	Flexibility in Database Structure (5 points)

Ability to incorporate new tests/results as experience is gained with the system leading to constant system evolution and improvement.  Proposals will be evaluated on the flexibility incorporated into the system.

The year-long base contract will consist of an initial development/testing period followed by a production period.  The vendor will specify a go-live date, which should be as early as possible while meeting the specified objectives. 

J.	Cross-Browser Compatibility (4 points)

Proposal should highlight adequate programming ability to attain cross-browser compatibility in the system.
 
K.	Formal User Feedback Procedures (2 points)

The proposal must demonstrate a formal plan and/or experience in obtaining, tracking and incorporating suggestions for system improvements.  These suggestions will originate from the NIDDK staff (as opposed to patients).


Past Performance

The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror?s past performance based on information obtained from the references provided by the offeror, as well as other sources known to the Government.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on all standards of acceptable performance.  
The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices.

Past performance will not be scored, but the Government?s conclusions about overall quality of the offeror?s past performance will be influential in determining the merits of the offeror?s proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will consider the number of severity of an offer?s problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the offeror?s overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.

The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror. 

Past Performance Information:  Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) which demonstrate similar work in nature to this  Statement of Work.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
We see risk with the requirement to develop using "Word". Use of an Industry Standard page layout program such as PageMaker, QuarkXpress or Adobe In-Design would ensure more stable documents and reduce down time.  Our experience when using Word is that it crashes when working with large documents and graphics. Plus, we are going to have problems finding a printer who will use "Word" for such a large job.  If they do agree to it, they will have a major caveat that we cannot blame them if the quality of printing (and thus the final publication) is less than great.  To mitigate this risk would the government be willing to permit use of an Industry Standard page layout program?  PDF files can still be generated with these programs. 

 

The answer to this question depends on what phase of the product is being addressed. 

 

For example:

 

(1)     The final CD products provided for the instructor?s use ?MUST BE? in ?WORD? (Instructor Guide, Student Workbook, PP Slides, & Test Bank).  

(2)     During the development phase, the product must be in a format that can be manipulated by the Curriculum Project Manager.   

(3)     The final products to be printed/duplicated can be printed in any program the company chooses to use as long as it meets Curriculum?s approval.  

 

2. SOW 5.2 - How many reviewers will the government be able to provide to support this project? This information will help us determine if the project can be completed in such a short time line. Does the government find five business days acceptable for turn-around?  This information will help us establish a schedule to determine staffing and price. 

 

One reviewer will be provided to review this project 
Five business days is acceptable for turn-around time.

Oral proposals are not acceptable.     All FAR/DFAR clauses can be obtained at www.far.npr.gov & http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFFARa.htm).   Local clauses can be found in the Disa Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DARS) at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp. No numbered notes apply.  Brand Name Justification is as follows:
BRAND NAME DOCUMENTATION

1.  Identify the activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 

United States Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE)

2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 

Hewlett Packard network switches. 

3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the sole source acquisition.  Justify the use of one source.
If expertise is the basis for the brand name determination, structure the justification as follows: 

he network switches will be part of an existing operational Local Area Network (LAN) consisting of only Hewlett Packard devices. Purchasing HP switches ensures guaranteed compatibility with existing devices and management software tools. HP Procurve Manager management software is currently utilized and allows network managers to manage and monitor all aspects of the LAN. One important capability is the ability to install security patches to all network switch operating systems from a central console with just a few mouse clicks. This greatly enhances the ability to react to security vulnerabilities. While software from other vendors has similar capabilities, it would require replacing over 20 additional existing HP switches at an estimated cost of $60,000.00 to obtain the same level of functionality. This change in network switch brands would also require network downtime.

HP offers a lifetime warranty. HP offers next-business-day advance replacement, and phone and Web support at no additional cost. Software updates for HP ProCurve Networking products are available at no extra charge, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for as long as you own the product. Other brands such as Cisco Systems charge for this service.  Based solely on 20 networks switches, the government (USAMMCE) will avoid costs of approximately $16K during the 5 year life cycle by choosing the HP brand switch.

LAN administrators are already trained on managing these devices. Switching to a different vendor would require additional training.  

4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for sole source procurement?

<DESC>Thanks for the answers, I have couple more questions as follows  1. Solicitation does not mention anything about the kind of lighting required in the trailer &amp; how many lights are required?? 2. No of Door required in the trailer? 3.  No of windows required and what size?? Answer: The lighting requirement is specified in section 12 A. It specifies how much light is to be on countertop, not how many lights are required. If they install less powerful lights, they will need to put in more lights to meet the requirement.  No lighting is to be mounted directly above chamber. Double doors in back, full width of trailer. Single 36&quot; door near front of trailer adjacent to admin area, and a 78&quot; roll up door with patient lift behind the single door adjacent to front of chamber. Put 24&quot; X36&quot;  window in single door. No other windows.
