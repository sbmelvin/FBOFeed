<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS:

1)  There will be one field trip, location undetermined at this time, for up to 150 participants only.  Guests will not be included.  2)  There is no previous contractor.  Award will be made upon completion of the evaluation of offers.  3) Marketing is not required as there is a specific audience:  State Agriculture Agencies, the USDA, foreign departments of agriculture.  Therefore there is no need for mailers, ads or mailing lists.
4) There is no requirement for bags, pens, thank you items, etc. The conference program will list just the conference dates, times and speakers.  The program size and content is not required to be extravagant unless the contractor wishes to include that in their quote but special consideration will not be given to offers in respect to the proposed program appearance.  Contractor shall design and provide 200 programs.  A specific logo is not required.
5)  Exhibitors will only be provided a table and the space to set up.  The exhibitor fee should not be considered when submitting an offer as it does not concern the contractor.  The contractor shall communicate with all exhibitors and arrange for all exhibitor logistics for their displays means it is the contractors responsibility to assist with the set up.  There will be no other contractors or subcontractors.
6) There is no requirement for food and beverages.  As stated in the original synopsis solicitation, the conference will be held at the Sheraton and therefore should not be a concern for contractors offering a quote. The accommodations for participants do not have a bearing on this requirement and therefore should not be taken into consideration when an offer is submitted.  There is no sponsorship outreach and therefore coordination is not required.
7) The number of speaks and honorium to be paid is not to be addressed by the offer as part of their quote.  The IPIAC Committee will determine the number of speakers they will invite to speak.
8) The registration fee will be determined by the IPIAC Committee and the Committee shall remain the owner of all funds received.  The contractor is required to collect the fees on behalf of the IPIAC Committee.  The contractor will be informed which payments they are authorized to make on behalf of the IPIAC from funds collected.
9) There is no additional fee associated with the poster board sessions.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to obtain thirty (30)  4 X 8 poster boards, mount the poster material provided to the contractor onto the poster board and set up the poster boards in the room provided.
10) The PowerPoint presentations will be provided to the contractor by the presenter in order for the contractor to make or have made the 200 CD?s of the conference proceedings.  It is not known at this time whether the contractor shall present the PowerPoint to the AV staff.  That determination will be made at a later date and should not significantly affect an offer.
11)  The meeting will be three (3) full days, with registration on Tuesday, May 22, 2007 from 12:00 pm to 6:00 pm.; Wednesday, May 23 registration at 7:00 am to 8:00 am and meeting 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.; Thursday, May 24 meeting at 8:00 am to 1:00 pm with a field trip to location to be determined from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.; Friday May 25 meeting 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.

12) The contractors staff must be on site before the conference to coordinate setup and finalize details.  Travel to the conference site in order to make an offer is not required.
