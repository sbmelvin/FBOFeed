<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Microwave Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Laboratory Equipment consisting of a network analyzer to 110 GHz, with upgrade capability to 325 GHz, an equipment rack, dielectric probes, material measurement software, coax/waveguide hardware, calibration kits from DC to 67 GHz, training course on the basic operation and theory of the Performance Network Analyzer (PNA), and 220-325 GHz Test Set Modules. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (formerly Hewlett Packard) pursuant to FAR 6.203-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.  Aligent Technologies, Inc., is the only known U.S. source of a network analyzer which is able to support banded millimeter-wave modules extending the frequency range up to 325 GHz. The dielectric probes and material measurement software used by Agilent Technologies, Inc., are considered proprietary; therefore, unique software development for this network analyzer by another source is not available.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 11, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for services and use of facility to support the 2004 Great Moonbuggy Race.  The Great Moonbuggy Race gives undergraduate and high school students from around the nation an opportunity to apply engineering skills and develop team spirit in an activity that will enhance awareness about human exploration and development of space.  Moonbuggies are built from the students’ own design - recreating the lunar experience of the Apollo astronauts and looking ahead to further human exploration of the solar system.  Two-person crews (one male and one female) assemble their collapsible vehicles, receive a safety inspection, and self-power their vehicles along a simulated lunar terrain obstacle course. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  The emphasis on space and space exploration at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center’s grounds presents a setting that includes objects from the Apollo missions to the moon, a simulated lunar surface, and an existing display of an Apollo Lunar Rover Vehicle (Moonbuggy).  The U.S. Space and Rocket Center walkways are broad and easily modified to create an extensive simulated lunar terrain course including craters, rocks, lava ridges, inclines, and lunar soil.  Additionally, the U.S. Space and Rocket Center caters to public interest in space and a crowd of spectators with high interest in the space program can easily access and view the Great Moonbuggy Racecourse.  The U.S. Space and Rocket Center’s staff is experienced and equipped to modify the racecourse and can fully support the event.  There are no other comparable facilities within several hundred miles of Marshall Space Flight Center. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on March 15, 2004.

The following delineates the selection process:  EVALUATION FACTORS  (Phase I & Phase II)             Factor 1 – Technical              Factor 2 – Past Performance             Factor 3 – Price  Factor 1 is significantly more important  than Factors 2, and 3 combined.  Factor 2 is more important than Factor 3.   PHASE I -- All interested parties shall submit a quantity of 65 EA, 100-meter warning cartridges (CLIN 0001); 175 EA, 200-meter warning cartridges (CLIN 0002); 65 EA, 300-meter warning cartridges (CLIN 0003) and 50 EA projectiles (CLIN 0004) with their proposal.

Delivery order(s) for production quantities will be issued to the vendor or vendors determined to be the best value to the Government.  Factor 1 – TECHNICAL – WARNING CARTRIDGES & PROJECTILES (CLINS 0001-0004) CONFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NSWC PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION STATED IN PARAGRAPH 3 OF THE SPECIFICATION.   The Government will evaluate and assign a numerical rating for the following technical factors during Phase I:             1.  Chambe r pressure             2.  Function and casualty             3.  Waterproofness             4.  Physical             5.  Range and Azimuth             6.  Projectile Sound Level             7.  Cartridge Markings             8.  Projectile Light Flash             9.  Smoke Cloud            10.  Projectile Velocity  Factor 2 – PAST PERFORMANCE. During the source selection process (Phase I and Phase II), the Government will assess the offeror's past performance in the evaluation for contract award.  Accordingly, each offeror is required to submit a list of up to five of its most recent contracts within the past three years, either completed or on-going, for the same/similar products or services. It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. Government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable.  Offerors are authorized to provid e information relative to any problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions taken by the offeror.  The Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Officer will evaluate the offeror's past performance based upon the information furnished by the offeror and/or other information obtained by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or securing any information not furnished with the offer.  The SSA/Contracting Officer may, however, utilize all available information, including information not provided by the offeror, in the past performance evaluation.  The Government reserves the right to review less than all information submitted, and to only analyze sufficient information to make a reasonable determination of each offeror’s past performance rating.  If sufficient information regarding the offeror’s corporat e history is not available, the offeror is encouraged to submit for evaluation evidence of relevant past performance on the part of the offeror’s key/principal employees, as either a prime or subcontractor.  Past performance is assessed by the SSA/Contracting Officer and is assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adjectival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other than the lowest priced of fer if doing so would result in greater value to the Government in terms of technical performance, quality, reliability, life cycle cost, or lower overall program risk.   As a part of the past performance evaluation, the Government will assess the offeror's previous compliance with the requirements of FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 as applicable.  Factor 3  – PRICE EVALUATION  Price will not be rated but will be considered in determining the “best value” to the Government.  The best value determination may result in the Government being willing to pay a premium for higher technical capability.  The price becomes more important as the degree of equality increases between offers.     Offerors shall submit pricing in the following format:   CLIN   QTY   YEAR 1   YEAR 2   YEAR 3   YEAR 4   YEAR 5  0001 – Warning Cartridges, 100 Meter  200 EA (Mi n)   5,000 EA   25,000 EA   50,000 EA   100,000 EA  CLIN   QTY   YEAR 1   YEAR 2   YEAR 3   YEAR 4   YEAR 5  0002 – Warning Cartridges, 200 Meter  200 EA (Min)   5,000 EA   25,000 EA   50,000 EA   100,000 EA  CLIN   QTY   YEAR 1   YEAR 2   YEAR 3   YEAR 4   YEAR 5  0003 – Warning Cartridges, 300 Meter  4,400 EA (Min)   5,000 EA   25,000 EA   50,000 EA   100,000 EA  CLIN  0004 – Projectiles   QTY  100 EA (Min)   YEAR 1   Price will be evaluated using the yearly average unit price for the ordering quantities as listed above for each year.  The pricing portion of the contract award will be based on the lowest proposed average unit price for each year (1-5).   The Government is not obligated to order beyond the minimum quantity.  In order to permit the Government to benefit from the economies of scale, offerors shall permit the Government to interpolate any quantity between 5,000 EA – 100,000 EA utilizing the prices submitted in the above format.  The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with the highest  adjectival technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the greatest value to the Government.  52.212-4 TAILORING -- The following paragraphs are hereby added to the clause:    (o)  Warranty. The contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for continued Systems Engineering Support to perform pre-assessment surveys to establish a baseline of NASA's systems engineering maturity and performance. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this support from Systems Management, Inc., as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements. Systems Management International has provided expert evaluation of NASA's existing technical standards, policies, and procedures on systems engineering for several years.  To bring another contractor on board to support the pre-assessment surveys as an independent observer would involve substantial start-up costs and time delays in gaining familiarity with the Agency's current systems engineering policy and issues, and these costs are not exepected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 23, 2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Chornobyl Research Unit (CRU), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), intends to enter into a sole-source contract with the Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology (RRCRMHE), Ilicha str., 290, 246042 Gomel, Belarus.  The CRU is responsible for research programs in radiation effects on thyroid cancer and leukemia.  CRU develops, administers, and evaluates contract-supported applied research programs.  The main purpose of the project, Study of Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Disease in Belarus, which is comprised of smaller projects, is to carry out large-scale epidemiological and clinical-morphological studies in order to detect forms of thyroid pathology in subjects age 18 and under (in Apr. 86) who were exposed to radiation as released by the accident at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Station in April 1986, and who had their dose to thyroid gland measured.  As a result of studies that have been carried out under other arrangements, coefficients of the risk of the development of thyroid cancer and other thyroid disease have been investigated; and analysis has been made of the relationship between the number of cases of cancer or disease per year and the distribution depending on the sex, age at the moment of exposure, geographical zone, time of appearance of disease and the age at the time.  Efforts have also been made to compare the carcinogenic effect of I-131 with that of x-ray and gamma-radiation.  Since 1986, the Ministry of Health has carried out screening of tens of thousands of children from contaminated areas of Belarus.  These investigations have included palpation and ultrasound scans, and numerous laboratory tests for the thyroid function.  During the first weeks after the accident, the Institute of Radiation Medicine in Moscow made direct measurements of thyroid radioactivity in nearly 40,000 person and these results represent a basis for individual dose assessment.  From these data, a cohort has been established of subjects who were age 18 or under at the time of the accident or who were still in utero; this cohort will ultimately include up to 12,000 persons.  The selected population of Belarusian children will be carefully examined by highly-skilled specialist biannually under another mechanism for up to 3 cycles in order to diagnose thyroid disease.  The overall project has practical purposes, the most important is the fact that the investigations will provide a guide for minimizing the after-effects of the Chornobyl accident, in particular, thyroid disease in person who were exposed in their childhood.  The Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology (RRCRMHE) located in Gomel, is the heir to the original Clinical Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology (CRIRME) that was located in Minsk.  In January 2003 the Ministry of Health reorganized CRIRME into RRCRMHE and relocated to Gomel.  The latter is the only official source known to the Government devoted to studies of the aftereffects of Chornobyl accident.   The RRCRMHE is the headquarters for this project and is the only organization that can carry out the work in Belarus both from their scientific capability and it’s designation as Republican Center for Belarus.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22 applies as follows: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collects calls will be accepted.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: His Excellency Antonio Quintas do Espirito Santo, Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure, and Land Affairs, Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure, and Land Affairs, Avenue Presidente Kwame Nkruma, C.P. 130, Sao Tome & Principe, Phone: 239-22-33-75, Fax: 239-22-28-24  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the development of a deepwater port on the island of Sao Tome.  

The country of Sao Tome & Principe has plans to develop a deepwater port on the island of Sao Tome.  The lack of a deepwater port has increased the cost of imports into and exports out of Sao Tome and hindered economic growth.  Currently the island has a shallow draft port in Sao Tome City’s harbor, which is only capable of receiving small vessels.  Major oceangoing ships are forced to anchor over a mile offshore and small lighter vessels transport items, including containers, to the port’s single pier.  Once at the pier items are individually offloaded in a small overcrowded receiving area.  In the short term, the development of a deepwater port would affect the current inefficient logistical stream and lower costs of importing and exporting goods and commodities.   It could also provide facilities and warehouse space for the use of offshore oilfield support contractors.  In the long term, the development of a deepwater port could provide moorage, refueling and other services for commercial and other vessels and even support an offshore fishing fleet.  

The Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure and Land Affairs is the entity within the Government of Sao Tome & Principe that will serve as Grantee for the Feasibility Study.

The United States Trade & Development Agency (USTDA) has signed a grant agreement with the Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure and Land Affairs for the above mentioned Feasibility Study.  The terms of reference for the Deepwater Port Feasibility Study include:

·	Technical Analysis
·	Economic Analysis
·	Financial Analysis
·	Environmental Analysis
·	Review of Regulatory Issues
·	List of Proposed Equipment, including U.S. Sources of Supply
·	Implementation Plan
·	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $450,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, April 16, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

The Technical Assistance will assist the Government of Sao Tome & Principe with structuring an airport investment development plan for future development of the airport on Sao Tome. 

The expansion and modernization of the current airport facilities at Sao Tome’s airport are necessary for both present and future use.  Sao Tome can expect an influx of services requiring use of the airport in the near future as the Joint Development Zone oilfield exploration and development begins, as well as from increased tourism.  The Government of Sao Tome & Principe has recognized that improvements are needed for the airport, but the Government lacks a plan and feasibility studies for airport development that address current and future needs of airport users.  Present conditions at the airport are adequate by international standards but will not accommodate future growth.  The landing strip, terminal, and support facilities are amongst improvement areas that need to be made. 

The Government of Sao Tome & Principe needs a development plan with an unbiased review that would objectively analyze all aspects of the airport’s development.  Airport improvement projects would stem from the development plan and these improvements are needed in the near future to improve safety and increase airport efficiency.  

The Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure and Land Affairs is the entity within the Government of Sao Tome & Principe that will serve as Grantee for the Technical Assistance.

The United States Trade & Development Agency (USTDA) has signed a grant agreement with the Ministry of Public Works, Infrastructure and Land Affairs for the above mentioned Technical Assistance.  The terms of reference for the Airport Development Plan Technical Assistance include:

<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Technology Days 2004 at Scott AFB, IL 5-6 May 2004.  The objective of this meeting is to provide a forum for industry and research conduits to present maturing technologies that can be rapidly fielded.  Our focus will be on available technology solutions to support warfighter’s operational capabilities.  Our sight picture is to examine the technologies ready for transition within the next eight years, with focus reflected in the following topic areas:  

·	Force Projection 
o	Aircraft Survivability 
o	Air Refueling 
o	Precision Airdrop 
o	Autonomous All-Weather Landing
·	Base Opening 
o	Force Protection
o	Operations Support in Austere Environments
·	Information Superiority 
o	Secure, Global Connectivity and Information Technology

Additional details for each topic area are explained on attachment 1.  The primary medium for this forum are the briefing sessions.
Each day we’ll have briefing sessions, one hour session per group (four in the morning and four in the afternoon).  The nominal breakdown for each of the sessions is:
Brief - 40 minutes
Q&A - 10 minutes
Break - 10 minutes.  
The briefings will be held on the 3rd floor of Bldg 1700, in the McClellan Conference facility.  The audience attendance will be limited to Military, Civilian government officials, and government contracted subject matter experts with signed non-disclosure statements so briefings can be open to Proprietary Only discussions.  The McClellan Conference facility has space for 150 personnel and can be divided in two.  Using the briefing session scheme described above, there are 16 time slots with the potential for up to 32 if we divide the conference room and run simultaneous briefings.  This all depends on the response from this call for briefings.  In addition to the briefing sessions, we’ve made arrangements with Scott Club for exhibit/display tables and an ice-breaker for one-on-one interaction.
On 5 May, the Scott Club will be available for limited displays and exhibits for interested staff officers and leadership to stop by when available.  The hope is to provide an opportunity for AMC staff to interact with Industry and Lab representatives on a one-on-one basis.  Also, after the 5 May briefing secessions, we will host an Ice-breaker in this open forum at the Scott Club to further provide opportunity for interaction.  Due to limited space and power availability, we only have room for 20 exhibits tables and limited poster board presentations.  Updated information regarding layout of the club may be obtained from the AMC Tech Day Website listed below.
If you intend to brief/exhibit/demonstrate a technology, we request exhibit requirements (to include space and power) and a two-page executive summary/abstract to us NLT 31 Mar 04.  Due to the limited time slots available, a selection process will be applied, if response dictates, based on applicable topic areas.  The announcement of final presentation schedule/agenda will be provided NLT 7 Apr 04.  Final presentations for those selected are required to us by COB 21 Apr 04.
Anyone wishing to present/participate in the conference must submit a registration form no later than 28 Apr 04.  Each presentation group presenting/exhibiting will be required to pay a conference fee.  The conference fee includes:  conference charges, coffee and light refreshments, and the Ice-breaker.  The use of cameras or audio/visual recorders is strictly prohibited throughout the conference except during the Ice-breaker.  Export and import licenses, taxes, and/or shipping for any exhibit are the responsibility of the delegate providing it.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed price contract to FN Herstal, Belgium for 173 GAU-21, .50 Caliber Machine Gun/Pintle Head Mount Weapon Systems for MH-60 Multi-Mission Helicopter.  This firm fixed price contract will provide for the procurement of these weapon systems for the MH-60 Multi-Mission Helicopter platform.  FN Herstal will also provide engineering technical support services, technical publications, training of organizational and intermediate level maintenance personnel, and supply of preventative maintenance kits. This weapon system will provide the U.S. Navy with a weapon system common with USMC assault support helicopters that will introduce a significant increase in interoperability, improved safety features, a higher volume of fire, a minimization of aircraft modifications, no significant weight increases and a reduction in maintenance costs. Deliveries shall take place from FY04 to FY08.  The scope of this contract shall include all of the efforts necessary to manufacture and deliver the 173 systems. In addition, Herstal will design and develop the actual interface between airframe and weapon system. This contract will be issued on a sole source basis to FN Herstal, the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the M3M. FN Herstal is the only known firm whose product successfully meets the stated requirements. To award the contract to another vendor would result in excessive duplication of effort and costs to the government. FN Herstal is also sufficiently poised to respond to a rapid deployment capability. See Note 22

The new requirement is currently being re-competed under R-2004-HR-00086 under the Financial and Business Solutions GSA Schedule #520.  The services procured requires the contractor to facilitate the implementation of the Program, analyze the pipeline of defaulted assets, and sort assets into appropriate resolution vehicles.

The period of performance will be six months, which includes three months of continued services and 3 months of transition to the new contractor for this requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.  This SIR No. 1 is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the submission of bid samples for testing by the FAA nor costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested technical documentation. All interested sources must submit technical documentation for SIR No. 1 in writing by March 16, 2004.  An RFO will not be issued until after the completion of Phases 1 and 2.

On December 15, 2003, NASA released a public announcement of a public-private competition (using the standard competition process) for these services under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76. The activity to be competed is the performance of metallic test article development and general and precision machining services on-site at Langley Research Center.  Approximately 37 Government civil service Full-Time-Equivalents (FTE's) currently perform this on-site activity. The service provider will be required to fabricate, assemble, and integrate a wide range of hardware, including but not limited to:  wind tunnel models, such as force and moment models, cryogenic models, acoustic models, propulsion simulation models, and aero-elastic models; free flight models; model modifications; model components; model support systems; aircraft flight test hardware; space-flight instruments; repair of wind tunnel support hardware; fixtures; test facility modifications and hardware; and modifications and repairs to existing research hardware. Work disciplines include conventional and specialized machining processes inclusive of, but not limited to:  milling, turning, boring, electrical discharge machining, drilling, fitting, polishing, sanding, filling and sawing, precision grinding, precision lapping, metal finishing, precision assembly and integration of systems, numerically controlled wire electrical discharge machining, numerically controlled turning, numerically controlled milling, numerically controlled high-speed milling, and CAD/CAM programming.  The service provider shall be capable of performing precision machining of hardware to tolerances as accurate as +/-.002 inches on contoured surfaces and produce surface finishes as low as 2 rms (micro inches).  Other dimensional requirements may require accuracy to within .0002 inches.  The service provider shall have expertise in the application and machining of a full range of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other materials that are common to the aerospace industry.  Materials most frequently used for these activities are 15-5 PH stainless steel, Vascomax and aluminum alloys.   Some end items will require the service provider to collaborate with NASA research scientists and engineers to enable the concurrent design and development of research hardware. All qualified firms, both large and small, are encouraged to respond.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this procurement is 33641, and the size standard under this code is 1,000 employees. Firms having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement documenting their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  It is required that responses be limited to 7 pages.	Responses should be comprehensive and specific in describing experience related to the requirements specified above.  For example, responses should describe experience in:  metallic test article development, listing types of models or other hardware produced; general and precision machining, listing types of service performed or product delivered; producing flight hardware, working with specified materials, and meeting stringent tolerances as listed above.  Responses should indicate if the firm has experience in concurrent design and development of research hardware.  Work cited as relevant should contain a brief technical description, contract number and type, period of performance dates, dollar value, and a customer reference with a current phone number.  Responses must also include the following:  name and address of your firm; size of business (number of employees); whether your firm is large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), small women-owned, and/or a HUBzone small business.  Responses should indicate affiliate information, parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if respondent is a potential subcontractor) or subcontractors (if respondent is a potential prime). No solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.

<DESC>Innovative Information Exploitation Technology and Systems, SOL BAA 04-17, Abstracts Due: 9 April 2004, Proposals Due: 18 June 2004; POC: Dr. Robert Tenney, Deputy Director, DARPA/IXO; Phone (703) 696-2298.  BACKGROUND:  DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of enabling technology, critical subsystems, and full system concepts that will provide revolutionary improvement to the efficiency and effectiveness of military command, control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C2ISR) and strike operations in complex battlespaces.  The goal of this solicitation is to identify and develop novel ideas about sensing, signal processing, target characterization, data fusion, target tracking, predictive awareness, battle management, collaborative planning, and visualization that can contribute to future warfighting effectiveness.  Ideas can address 1) ways to employ new scientific/technical developments to achieve significant increases in component performance; 2) novel combinations of existing technologies into systems that create new warfighting capabilities; or 3) combinations of both.  Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases. The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept, in an exploratory effort lasting between 3 months and one year. Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward increasingly robust technology or system development, and consist of 12-18 month segments with specific capability goals to be achieved at the end of each segment.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  The DARPA Information Exploitation Office develops sensors and information processing systems with application to battle space awareness, targeting, command and control, and the supporting information infrastructure required to address surface threats across the full range of anticipated warfighting environments.  IXO focuses on automating and accelerating the processes by which U.S. forces perform surface target interdiction in environments that require very high combat identification confidence and an associated low likelihood for inadvertent collateral damage.  Proposals that address any aspect or combination of aspects that fall within IXO’s broad mission objectives may be submitted under this BAA.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:  Areas of specific interest include but are not limited to: 1) Sensors, 2) Exploitation, 3) Positive, Combat Identification,  4) Battlespace Visualization, 5) Network-Centric Battle Management,  6) Precision Tracking and Targeting, 7) Weapon Effectiveness Assessment, 8) Information Management of Logistics, 9) Distributed Control of Networked Autonomous Robotic Platforms, and 10) Urban Warfare Technology.  Further details on technical areas, program phases, selection criteria, and Submission Instructions may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which can be accessed at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/IXO/index.htm.      TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 04-17.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be sent to BAA04-17@darpa.mil. Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted at http://www.darpa.mil/IXO/Solicitations/IXO/index.htm under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.  To be considered for the initial round of funding, proposal abstracts are encouraged and  must be submitted no later than 12:00 p.m. (EST), 9 April 2004.  Proposals must be submitted no later than 12:00 p.m. (EST), 18 June 2004.  BAA 04-17 will be open until 8 March 2006.  Proposals submitted under this BAA after 18 June 2004 will be accepted, but will not be considered for the first round of funding.  Please reference http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/IXO/index.htm for complete submission instructions.  OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCUs and MIs participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of technology for exclusive competition among these entities.  Government contractors are required to register at the Government’s Central Contractor Registration site in order to negotiate contracts with most government agencies.  This URL is provided as a reference:  http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>Need:
An advanced audio-visual design concept for the new practice facility is needed to achieve the most efficient acquisition and distribution of video assets throughout the building. The solution should be delivered by a vendor with proven experience and expertise in AV integration for basketball facilities. The vendor must also demonstrate clear knowledge of how to best integrate the existing XOS Technologies digital video editing system in the design to guarantee most efficient workflow. A separate room dedicated to video operations has been incorporated in the plans and is a must. The video room must be designed to work as the video “hub” for both men and women’s programs. All video acquisition, editing and distribution will originate here. Clean and professional looking design of all AV equipment (new and existing) is required for functionality as well as for recruiting tours. At least two workstation areas are required to accommodate both programs. Professional, high quality video routing and source control are desired for improved video quality and easy workflow. New satellite receivers and a system for automated recording of broadcast events are critical for getting scouting video to the coaches more quickly. A DVD duplication system would be helpful in getting DVD content more quickly to coaches and players. The halftime room will require a direct video feed from the video room to review and plan game strategy. Both programs need play diagramming capabilities in from the plasma displays to quickly and easily toggle between diagrams and video clips. Audio and video connectivity between the video room and a number of rooms throughout the facility are desired. The connectivity should also give coaches the flexibility to playback video from any in the video room.  


Primary Capabilities:
The specific AV solution needs to be one that allows the seamless integration of advanced digital video technology for the purpose of acquiring, editing, managing, distributing and presenting multimedia for scouting and team preparation. Acquisition technology should include a software solution capable of automated download of video from satellite to any number of recording devices, including the ability to go directly to hard disk. The solution should not require setting timers or manual record starts. All video sources and destinations should be managed through a router. No video looping from deck to deck is acceptable. Additionally, users in the video room should have complete control of all devices (i.e. record, pause, FF, REW etc) and routing of those devices through a touch panel to provide for greatest ease of use. All video equipment shall be professionally racked and wired. Rackmounted displays should be provided to monitor video recording. The displays should be programmable so as to display the active video from several different sources at a user-defined interval. An LCD monitor should be provided for performing all video preview on the digital editing system. New SVHS and DVD record decks will be needed to handle future coaching and player requests. A DVD duplicator like the one used in football is necessary for high-speed dub of DVD content. Video connectivity needs to be established between the video control room and 10 different locations throughout the facility. The connectivity should allow video to be routed from any video room source to any of the designated locations. Coaches should also have complete playback control of the remote video source. This functionality is imperative for the halftime room needs. At 4 of the designated plasma screens, the vendor shall provide software that allows the coaches to easily draw up plays using an NCAA regulation court background. The design will allow the coach to diagram a play with the software and then easily toggle to the selected video input for video review. The software can reside on existing coaches’ laptops used for video review. Furthermore, the technical solution shall already exist and be available within eight weeks of order confirmation.  On-site installation and training is a must. 24-hour service and support must also be provided 365 days a year.

<DESC>Sources Sought:  The USCG ELC anticipates awarding a requirements type contract for the inspection, repair, testing and calibration of Woodward Governors: NSN 2990-01-329-8355 Diesel Engine Part Number 8571-584--  The calibration and set-up data is held as proprietary by the Fairbanks Morse. The USCG ELC does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures, test specification or calibration set up data.  The Government intends to solicit only Fairbanks Morse and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U. S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specification along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  It is also the belief of the Government that only Fairbanks Morse holds the proprietary calibration and set-up data.  The U. S. Coast Guard does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the overhaul capabilities of alternate or equal products.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  It is intended to award a Requirements Type Contract with one (1) Base year and Four (4) option years.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  See Numbered Note  22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

BACKGROUND:  

The Inspector General Department of Defense (IG DoD) is currently implementing a long-range strategy to conduct audits of DoD financial statements. The Chief Financial Officer’s Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576) requires that agencies prepare annual financial statements, and the IG DoD audit the agency prepared financial statements. For a sample of IG DoD financial statement reports, go to http://www.dodig.osd.mil/audit/reports/03report.htm and select reports D-2003-050, D-2003-047, D-2003-042.

The Department’s financial statements must cover all accounts and associated activities of each office, bureau, and activity of each component within the DoD.  The IG DoD must verify the reliability of agency financial statements through the use of audits and other methods.  Currently, the Department’s financial statements are being developed using various financial management systems throughout the DoD.  The reliability of these systems directly impacts the DoD’s ability to produce reliable financial statements.  

The IG DoD is committed to increasing the resources devoted to auditing the financial statements, and the related financial management business activities.  The IG DoD’s strategy is intended to facilitate the Department’s commitment to improve financial management and attain auditable financial statements that support an unqualified opinion.  To accomplish this strategy, NAVAIR AD intends to develop commercial contract sources to perform assessments of DoD financial management business activities and practices.  

SERVICES REQUIRED: 

Reliability Assessments of DoD Financial Operations 

Sources are sought to conduct reliability assessments of individual DoD Components involving their financial related operations, activities, functions, and processes, used to compile and prepare the DoD's financial statements.  The assessments will also determine whether internal controls over financial reporting are in place and operating as intended.  

Examples of the DoD Components that may require an assessment include but not limited to:
- Army General Fund
- Army Working Capital Fund
- Navy General Fund
- Navy Working Capital Fund
- Air Force General Fund
- Air Force Working Capital Fund

A reliability assessment is a preliminary evaluation to determine if an entity’s financial statements can withstand a full-scale audit and a means by which to identify significant issues, if any, that may preclude the performance of a full-scale financial statement audit.  The specific services required for each type of assessment will be reflected in individual statements of work for each task order.

A performance work statement will be developed on a case-by-case basis describing the technical requirements, and functional performance requirements and the nature and type of service(s) needed.

The reliability assessments must conform to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) [http://www.gao.gov/govaud/yb2003.pdf] and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) standards.  The IG DoD will monitor the contractor’s work in accordance with the General Accounting Office (GAO)/President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) Financial Audit Manual (FAM), Section 650, "Using the Work of Others."  Specifically, the IG DoD will determine whether the contractor's work complies with GAGAS and AICPA standards through the use of periodic contractor reporting and ongoing access to contractor’s working papers.  The IG DoD will also ensure that the work supports the reliability assessment conclusions.   The IG DoD will issue task order contracts with variable performance timeframes for each order.  It is envisioned that IPA with IG DoD oversight will primarily conduct the reliability assessments.  

Contract Objective(s).  The overall program objective is to determine whether various DoD financial statements, taken as a whole, are accurately presented in all material respects, and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  The objective(s) of individually awarded task orders will be to determine the accuracy and reliability of the DoD Components Financial Management Systems, processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of agency financial statements.   

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

An interested party should be able to demonstrate, in any capability statements submitted, experience with evaluating Government financial and financial related operations including financial management systems, processes, activities, functions, operations, policies, and procedures involved in the compilation and preparation of an agencies financial statements.  NAVAIR-AD intends to award one or more contracts to have access to the full range of expertise required. Experience may include, both government and commercial work that the offeror has performed.  Demonstrated evidence may include, but not be limited to customer names and addresses, description of work performed/delivered, description of types/complexity of systems worked on, description of strategies to accomplish the work, description of communication strategies with the customer, and significant accounting and information technology issues resolved.  If applicable, highlight any Government financial and financial related work performed (include contract numbers).  Interested parties should be able to demonstrate their ability to perform these evaluations with only personnel that are U.S. citizens.  Finally, offerors should include an analytical comparison of their capability in terms of the services requested by this RFI.   

RESPONSES TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SHOULD CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:

1) A 3-5 page summary of the contractor’s “relevant” prior work; 2) description of any potential conflicts of interest the offeror may have in performing the work, 3) A brief description of the contractor’s quality control processes for deliverables; 4) references (names and contact information) for whom the contractor has performed similar work, 5) a one-page corporate summary including your web site, 6) a listing of any current negotiated GSA schedule, government contract, or commercial pricing rates, and 7) a statement identifying if the offeror is a small business, 8(a) firm, small disadvantaged business, women-owned business, or HUBZone firm.

This is a Request For Information announcement only. This is not a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission to this RFI nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

Written capability statements must be submitted no later than 22 March 2004 to:

SUBJECT:  S--SOURCES SOUGHT FOR PRIVATIZATION OF WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS FORT AP HILL, VIRGINIA.   

POC:  Douglas Smith, Contract Specialist, (703) 767-9409, Defense Energy Support Center, (DESC-EA).
 
DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and, Fort AP Hill, Virginia, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Water and Wastewater Utility Distribution Systems at Fort AP Hill, Virginia.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Fort AP Hill, VA and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  
 
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire water and wastewater utility systems and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include the commodity itself.  
 
INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
 
Note:	(1).  All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  Companies responding to this notice of interest are responsible for verification of all inventory data.
 
(2).  Companies responding to this notice of interest shall respond to interest in the entire scope of the requirement.
 
Fort A P Hill Overview
Located approximately 80 miles south of Washington D.C., Fort A.P. Hill is a U.S. Army Installation serving every component of the U.S. Armed Forces, active and reserve, and several other agencies of the U.S. Government including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the State Department. The Installation annually hosts between 500,000 and 800,000 man-days of training. 
While one of the largest installations in terms of landmass encompassing 76,500 acres, Fort A.P. Hill is also one of the smallest in terms of permanent garrison staff, with just 183 full time civilian employees and 13 active duty soldiers currently authorized. Primary products and services include delivery of maneuver and live fire training services, logistics support (shelter, food, and ammunition), recreational support, telecommunications and automation services, and public work services. The range complex consists of 50 direct fire ranges and 50 indirect fire ranges capable of accommodating mortar, artillery, and combined running fire, hover fire, and terrain flight aerial gunnery. Fort A.P. Hill is continually adjusting its ranges and services, with its integrated creative team of professionals designing solutions to meet the pressing dynamic needs of an Army in transformation.
Fort A.P. Hill hosts the Boys Scouts of America Jamboree in a four-year cycle. During the Jamboree, which spans a ten-day period, Fort A.P. Hill’s population explodes, making it very unique among all military installations. Among other services, Fort A. P. Hill (APH) provides potable water to the Boys Scouts during the Jamboree.

Water System Description
The potable water utility system at APH is composed of eight independent components including; Headquarter Areas, Central Camp, Cooke Camp, Pender Camp, and Rappahannock sites.  Wilcox, Archer, and Anderson area potable water systems are stand-alone, but can be connected to the Headquarters Area system when needed.  The water distribution systems consist of water wells, chlorination disinfection systems, booster pumps, water storage tanks, water mains, fire hydrants, isolation valves, air release valves and service lines.  
A unique requirement of the APH potable water system is to accommodate the National Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Jamboree that has been held at APH every four years since 1981. The actual BSA Jamboree lasts for only 10 days, but takes months to prepare the potable water system to accommodate the potable water demands from the Jamboree’s enormous attendance. It is estimated that APH hosts approximately 30,000 boy scouts and nearly 300,000 visitors during the Jamboree.


Water Sources
Water sources for Fort A.P. Hill are the Aquia, Middle and Lower Potomac aquifers. There are 25 active wells that draw water from the aquifers and supply the distribution systems.

The water systems within APH provide water for both domestic and fire protection use. With few exceptions, lines are located adjacent to roadways and fire hydrants readily accessible and each fire hydrant has its own isolation valve. Isolation valves are located near most pipe intersections making it easy to isolate portions of the system. The normal distribution pressure is approximately 54 pounds per square inch (psi) and is adequate for fire protection.

The water distribution system consists of pipes size raging from 1 to 24 inches. The total length of the pipe is approximately 256,00 linear feet.

Wastewater System Description

Collection System
The wastewater collection system at APH consists of gravity lines, equalization basins, lift stations and force mains that transport the wastewater generated to treatment facilities.  The wastewater collection system at APH can be divided into two sections.  The Main Cantonment section includes the areas where generated wastewater flows to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) for treatment.  The second section includes the outlying areas where the wastewater treatment occurs within the specific area.  

Equalization Basins
Some of the areas within the Main Cantonment have equalization basins.  The basins are located near lift stations and their primary purpose is to store flows to the lift station that are greater than the pump capacity.  When the flow to the lift station is greater than the lift station pump capacity, the excess flow is transferred to the equalization basins.  When the flow to the lift station is less than the lift stations pump capacity and if there is any wastewater in the equalization basin, the wastewater flows by gravity from the basin to the lift station.  Some of the basins have aeration to keep particles in suspension.  The aeration does provide treatment and assists in reducing the potential for hydrogen sulfide development


The wastewater generated at Main Cantonment area facilities flow to gravity collections lines, then on to a lift station where it is pumped to other gravity collection lines and eventually on to the Wilcox Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP).  The plant is located in the southeast portion of APH. Only a small portion of the wastewater generated at APH flows by gravity directly to the WWTP.  
The sub-areas that make up the Main Cantonment area are: Mahone, Jackson, HETH, Davis, Lake Travis, Rodes, Longstreet, Wilcox, Archer ASP, Anderson Headquarters and Naval Area. 
The wastewater collection system in the Main Cantonment area consists of pipes size raging from less than 4 to 12-inches. The total length of the pipe is 30.3 miles with approximately 380 manholes. 

REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Fort AP Hill is to transfer all capital assets of the water and wastewater treatment facilities to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within Fort AP Hill and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Fort AP Hill plant.  
 
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the water and wastewater systems at Fort AP Hill. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the State of Virginia and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact, phone no. and e-mail address.
 
SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  
 
DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EA) by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on Friday, March 16, 2004.  Sources may address responses to:  Defense Energy Support Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Room 3830, ATTN:  Douglas Smith, DESC-EA, Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-6222.

<DESC>The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1998 (Perkins III) directs the Secretary of Education to conduct an "independent evaluation and assessment of vocational and technical education programs under this Act" (also known as the National Assessment of Vocational Education or NAVE) and appoint an independent advisory panel (IAP) to advise the Secretary on the implementation of the assessment.  The legislation also authorizes the IAP to submit its own report or statement to Congress.  Because of that objective, technical support services are needed to assist the IAP to edit, design, and layout the IAP report.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  The intended source, MPR Associates, Inc., 2150 Shattuck Ave., Suite 800, Berkeley, CA  94704, has worked on recent NAVE reports, including the NAVE Interim and Final reports.  The firm has developed past report files, formatting styles, logos, and electronic signatures of IAP members, thereby making the editing and formatting of the IAP report more time efficient.  Above all, the IAP report requires quick turnaround and needs to be completed within 14 days of the effective date of this purchase order.  In addition, all IAP members must approve the report within this period of time.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the posted response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For more information, contact Michael Fong at Michael.Fong@ed.gov.

Fort Hunter Liggett is occupying over 165,000 acres in the San Antonio River valley next to the Los Padres National Forest.  The installation’s population today is 250 permanent residents and civil servants, with increases up to 4,000 transient active duty personnel when on training rotation.  Housing occupancy is typically 98 percent.
 
 
Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consists of the following capital assets:

Fort Hunter-Liggett 
 
A. Electrical Distribution System Description
The Fort Hunter Liggett electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.

Primary power enters the installation at 12 kV from Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).  There are 21 separate meters servicing cantonment, housing, Ammunition Supply Point, MPRC, Williams Hill, Bald Mountain, 8J, Site Alpha, and Site Bravo repeater station areas.  There are no substations on the installation, but the MPRC system has a switching station.  Average monthly consumption is approximately 830,000 kilowatt hours with usage peaking in late summer to early fall.  Emergency generators will remain under the ownership of the installation.
All overhead (pole-mounted) transformers have had all polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCB’s) removed.  All pad-mounted transformers except two have had PCB’s removed.

B.	 Propane System description:

The Fort Hunter Liggett propane system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the propane enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.  The system may include, but is not limited to aboveground storage tanks, valves, regulators, meters and distribution lines including service lines.

The propane system at Fort Hunter Liggett is concentrated within the cantonment area and consists of approximately 5,000 feet of distribution piping ranging from 1 to 2 inches in diameter.  Within the system are 26 aboveground storage tanks ranging in capacity from 287 to 18,000 gallons.  The propane system components vary in age, with the newest tanks installed in 1993.  The commodity provider, Northern Energy, also has approximately 46 propane tanks on post, of which they will retain ownership and control.  Propane is used mostly for heating and cooking.  Tanks are on a maintenance plan with the Directorate of Public Works to be painted every 5 years.  Propane systems are currently in code compliance.  Average consumption is 26,000 gallons of propane per month, with usage peaking in winter.
 
C. Water Distribution System: 

The Fort Hunter Liggett water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the water enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.  The system may include, but is not limited to wells, storage tanks, distribution piping and appurtenances.

There are no groundwater withdrawal permits.  Fort Hunter Liggett operates the supply system under California Department of Health Services Water Supply Permit No. 02-90-003, amended May 17, 2000 for corrosion control.  The Offeror shall comply with all sampling and testing requirements of the California Department of Health Services, Drinking Water Field Operations Branch, per Water Quality Monitoring Summary, (for a “Community Small Groundwater Developed” (CSGD)), for the Monitoring Period of January 2002-December 2004.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water systems.

D.  Wastewater Collection system:

The system may include, but is not limited to treatment facilities, collection piping and appurtenances.  

The wastewater system at Fort Hunter Liggett is concentrated mostly in the cantonment area and consists of collection piping, appurtenances, a treatment facility, and spray fields.  The original system was constructed in the 1950’s, and improvements have been made as needed since that time.  All wastewater, primarily domestic sewage and limited vehicle wash water, produced in the cantonment area is treated at the Fort’s 1.0 million gallon per day (mgd) wastewater treatment facility.  Average annual flow to the treatment facility is approximately 88,000 gallons per day (gpd).  Wastewater is treated in concrete-lined aerated lagoons.  The treatment train includes bar screens, a comminutor, a wetwell, and three uncovered aerated lagoons in series.  There are three wetwell pumps in the influent pump station that pump wastewater from the wetwell to a diversion box (valve chamber) that is normally set to divert wastewater to Pond #1, the first and primary aerated lagoon of the three in series.  Two of these pumps make up the primary and secondary pumps, but there is an additional pump for emergency backup.  This pump, in addition to having an electric motor like the other two, has a propane-driven motor so that the pump can still operate during a power outage.  These pumps are automatically controlled by the level of wastewater in the wetwell.

According to California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region, Standard Provisions and Reporting Requirements for Waste Discharge Requirements, January 1984, C. General Reporting Requirements, “Transfer of control or ownership of a waste discharge facility must be preceded by a notice to the Regional Board at least 30 days in advance of the proposed transfer date.  The notice must include a written agreement between the existing discharger and proposed discharger containing specific date for transfer of responsibility, coverage, and liability between them.  Whether an order may be transferred without modification and a public hearing is at the discretion of the Board.  If order modification is necessary, transfer may be delayed 120 days after the Regional Boards receipt of a complete Report of Waste Discharge.”

REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Fort Hunter Liggett is to transfer all capital assets of the electric, propane, water, and wastewater treatment facilities to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within Fort Hunter Liggett and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Fort Hunter Liggett plant.  
 
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the electric, propane, water, and wastewater systems at Fort Hunter Liggett. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the State of California and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact, phone no. and e-mail address.
 
SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  
 
DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EA) by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on Friday, March 16, 2004.  Sources may address responses to:  Defense Energy Support Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Room 3830, ATTN:  Douglas Smith, DESC-EA, Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-6222.

<RESPDATE>032504
<CONTACT>WILLIAM TENZ, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2885
<DESC>Description: The U.S. Research, Development and Engineering Command, (RDECOM)-  Armament, Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC),  Picatinny, New Jersey, 07806-5000, is currently seeking qualified  sources with the capability to conduct research on the development of  the next generation of smart coatings for Army materiel through the use  of nanotechnology as well as other novel technologies. The U.S. Army  Materiel Command directed ARDEC to develop a Corrosion Prevention and  Control Program to address the serious concern over weapon system  corrosion. The tasks within this program will be classified to the  secret level and as such all respondents must have safeguarding  capabilities, personnel security clearances and secured lab facilities in accordance with the following Security guidance documents: Security Classification Guide for DOD Low/Counter Low Observable Program  (1 October 2002), NationalIndustrial Security Program  (Operating Manual- DOD 5220.22-M, January 1995), Operating  Manual (DOD 5220.22M- Sup 1, February 1995), and COMSEC Supplement  (DOD 5220.22-S, March 1988).   Background: The coatings applied to weapon systems today are "dumb" in the sense  that once applied they perform their function without the ability to  self-correct because of changing circumstances or without the ability  to tell the user of potential anomalies such as corrosion or adhesion  problems. Their application and removal is also labor intensive and  potentially hazardous to the people working with them. Most of these  coatings need to be "touched-up" by hand and hide substrate damage  from the user of the product.  Program Objectives In order to reduce the levels of corrosion on various Army weapon systems,  a coating prototype will be developed. This prototype coating will  incorporate nanomachines (i.e. powders in the coatings, gears, motors  as well as electronic switches) that allow the coating to have  characteristics such as self-healing, self repairing, signature  management reduction, selective removal, corrosion resistance,  contain sensors, be able to alert the sustainment community of  potential problems with the coating, be able to modify physical  characteristics on command, be cost effective and environmentally  sound. Power supply sources will also be investigated such as 1 KW  fuel cells, lasers, carbon nanotubes, etc. The Program will have a three phase to achieve a modular approach to  develop a smart coatings™ system: Phase I R&D of Modular Nodes: This phase will consist of the following general tasks: Sensing Package Signature Management Corrosion/Material Degradation Coating Applications/Removal/Methods Self-Repair Self-Management/Artificial Intelligence Power Supply/Methods Development, Production, & Scale-Up of Novel Materials Phase II Integration: This phase will incorporate the results from Phase I modify, enhance,  and integrate the individual nodes into a functional smart coatings™  system.  Phase III Testing & Evaluation: This phase will include coating application and performance evaluation  to: define formal testing requirements perform development and laboratory testing of corrosion  inhibiting and self-repairing coatings performing mechanical properties testing perform material performance testing test to ensure attributes of existing coatings are not degraded prepare test report based on findings determine final coating composition determine onto what materiel coating system(s) can be applied develop & scale-up production of novel materials/technologies  scale-up of process to produce enough coating system material for limited field testing.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Combat Survivor Evader and Locator (CSEL) Survivor Radio System
<DESC>The US Air Force intends to purchase up to 5,000 AN/PRQ-7 radio sets for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) for the Combat Survivor Evader Locator System (CSEL) with The Boeing Company (deliveries set to begin by the 1st Quarter of FY05).  The full rate production decision on the CSEL system is set to be made by the 4th Quarter of FY04.  Boeing is the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the CSEL system and is the only known company with the requisite knowledge capable of providing the production requirement within the required time period.  Interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities which includes the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in small/survival radios or similar technologies, and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level. Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC), which clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort. Send your capability statements to SMC/GPK (ATTN: Capt. Jake Campbell), 2435 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. Oral communications are not acceptable. Email communications are acceptable.  This acquisition is intended to fulfill urgent operational requirements. This synopsis is a notice of intent to modify the contract and shall not be considered a request for offers. Prospective contractors should submit information in writing no later than the deadline date stated above with well-documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements. All production radios must meet the form, fit, function and NSA security design features of the existing CSEL AN/PRQ-7 Radio Set and the CSEL system architecture as described below. SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The CSEL system provides isolated personnel (IP) in need of rescue with: DoD GPS policy compliant precision Global Positioning System (GPS) based geoposition and navigation data in a navigation warfare (SAASM-based with direct Y capability) environment, two-way over-the-horizon (OTH), NSA approved secure data communications to Joint Search and Rescue Centers (JSRCs)/Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC), OTH beacon operation, Line-of-Sight (LOS) voice communication, sweep tone and swept tone beacon capabilities. The CSEL system architecture is composed of three segments: Over-the-Horizon (OTH), Ground, and User. The OTH segment operates in three modes each using one of three Communication systems: UHF Satellite Communications (UHFSATCOM), other assets, and COSPAS (Space System for Search of Vessels in Distress [Russian translation])/Search and Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking (SARSAT). The UHFSATCOM mode supports two-way world-wide secure data messaging for 197 users every half hour between the AN/PRQ-7 radio and the AN/GRC-242 UHF SATCOM Base Station (UBS) over a dedicated 5Khz channel.  IP or JSRC/RCC operator messages are then routed to the appropriate UBS and JSRC/RCC CSEL workstation JSRC/RCC command, control, and communications application (C3).  AN/PRQ-7 transmissions are automatically acknowledged upon receipt at the UBS prior to routing to the JSRC/RCC workstation C3 application.  A third OTH mode supports one-way secure messaging/geoposition from the AN/PRQ-7 using the Low Probability of Exploitation (LPE) capability to the JSRC/RCC workstation C3 application with return messaging capability available through UHF SATCOM.  In addition the AN/PRQ-7 is capable of dual LPE/UHF transmissions with return messaging over UHF SATCOM.  COSPAS-SARSAT provides non-secure, one-way data & beacon transmission and is intended for emergency use above or below 70 degrees latitude where UHFSATCOM coverage is lacking. The Ground segment is composed of Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE) compliant CSEL JSRC/RCC C3 application segment software. This software must be installed on a DII COE compliant workstation connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), which links the JSRC/RCC workstation to the UBS.  The User segment consists of the AN/PRQ-7 radio, J-6431/PRQ-7 Radio Set Adapter (RSA), Radio Set Mission Loading Application Software and a service-provided IBM compatible computer using the Windows 2000 operating system.  These elements of equipment are collectively known as CSEL Planning Equipment (CPE).  The Mission Loading Application software installed in the IBM compatible computer is required to load communications frequencies, waypoints, callsigns, routing information, and optional user password into the AN/PRQ-7.  The RSA provides the physical and electrical interface between the IBM compatible computer and an AN/PRQ-7 and also between key fill devices and the AN/PRQ-7 for loading of GPS keys. A second AN/PRQ-7 serves as the reference radios and is used to transfer GPS position, almanac, ephemeris, and time to the target radio.  Potential offerors must demonstrate the capability to produce an AN/PRQ-7 Radio Set and associated CPE that has completed a Multi-Service Operational Test and Evaluation under the oversight of DOT&E and be capable of receiving an AFOTEC finding that the system is effective and suitable and has received a positive DOT&E Beyond LRIP Report to Congress prior to first delivery of CSEL radios.  Contractor will be required to produce first delivery operational radios no later than one year after contract award to meet urgent operational requirements. See Note 26

 [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to submission of an offer to be

The government intends to solicit and negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with Belobox Networks, Inc. or its authorized distributors 
under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Belobox Networks, Inc. equipment is completely interchangeable and interoperable with existing equipment.

All capability statements received by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time March 22,
2004, will be considered by the government solely for the purpose of determining 
whether to initiate a full and open competitive procurement.  Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the offeror to provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc. in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on an other than full and open competitive basis based upon responses received.  The Government will not pay for any information received.

Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract will take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverable listed in the schedule.  
The clause at 52-212-1, Instructions to offerors-Commercial Items, (Jan 2004) is 
incorporated by reference and applies to this acquisition.  The Government

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO LIST OUT THE EVALUATION FACTORS THAT WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE PROPOSALS AND TO ISSUE A CUT OFF DATE FOR QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLCITATION.  The solicitation number is W74V8H-04-R-1122.    A full copy of t he solicitation can be obtained at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/services/RFP1.asp Questions regarding this solicitation are due no later than 10:00 am on 12 March 2004.  All questions must be submitted via email and must have the RFP number as to subject.  Questions may be emailed to talisa.spottswood@hqda.army.mil. TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS:  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government and represent the Best Value, price and o ther factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: I.  CORPORATE EXPERIENCE   The Government will evaluate the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s prior and on-going experience on projects similar in size and scope to the requirements described in the Statement of Work.  The proposal should demonstrate: Specific description of prior and on-going, direct experience in providing senior level science and engineering support to evaluate program technical baselines and assess the architectural design and technical maturity of the technology associated with maj or Air Force aircraft, electronics (avionics, radar, BMC3), and air-launched weapons programs and analysis of alternatives.  Demonstrate experience in assisting cost analysts in developing appropriate technical inputs for cost estimating relationships and analogies used in estimates.  Demonstrate experience in identifying new and emerging technologies and system acquisition strategies and their likely impact on existing costs.  II.  TECHNICAL APPROACH The Government will evaluate the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s comprehensive approach to the project requirements, detailed work plan, and proposed staffing to accomplish each task.  Credit will be given for innovations where considered appropriate and feasible for the p roposed area of application.  The Government will evaluate the degree to which the Offeror has performed a realistic appraisal and identified potential problems in undertaking this type of contractual effort.  The Government will also evaluate the OfferorÃ ¢Â€Â™s outline of state-of-the-art management to be used in managing the project.   This factor will be evaluated in terms of comprehension and feasibility and will demonstrate the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s complete understanding of the project requirements.   III.  Past Performance  Past Performance will be demonstrated by the level of performance on projects of similar size and scope.  The Offeror will provide a description of similar projects conducted, reference names and telephone numbers for each of these projects.  These require ments include aspects of cost, schedule and performance, including the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s records of (i) conforming to specifications, statements of work/work performance statements and standards of good workmanship; (ii) forecasting and containing costs on an y previous contracts; (iii) adherence to contract schedule, including the administrative aspect of performance; (iv) commitment to customer satisfaction; (v) businesslike concern for the interests of its customers; and (vi) (for large business only) meetin g small business and small and disadvantaged business subcontracting goals. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the Past Performance assessment, the Government may use data provided in the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposal/quote as well as data obtained from other sources.  Since the Government may not interview all of the sources pro vided by the Offeror it is incumbent upon the Offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of proving good past performance r ests with the Offeror.  In the event an Offeror has no record of relevant past performance or past performance information is not available the Offeror will receive a neutral evaluation that is neither favorable nor unfavorable. IV. PRICE The Government will evaluate price for completeness and reasonableness.  To be complete, the Offeror must provide all data that is necessary to support the quote.  The OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed price factors will be evaluated to determine if any are unreason ably high or low in relation to the OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s technical approach and in comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). (a) Evaluation Factors I (Corporate Experience) and II (Technical Approach) are equal.  Factors I and II, when combined, are equal to Factor III (Past Performance).  Factors I, II, III are significantly more important than price.  However, price will be gi ven more importance as the proposals approach technical equality. ADJECTIVAL RATINGS In order to provide the Offeror with an understanding of the value assigned by the Government, the criteria are assigned a relative order of importance.  The following adjectival ratings will be used: ExceptionalÃ¢Â€Â”The proposal demonstrates excellent understanding of requirements and approach significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government and no evident weaknesses with respect to the factor being rated.  Fully meets all Government objectives/requirements and does so in a way that provides very low risk, and high probability of success.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to questions posed by potential offerors. Question 1:  Why is this requisition listed as a sole source with a compatibility requirement?   Answer:  This procurement will provide compatibility with existing equipment and continuity of training. Question 2:  What is the software and interface package you have with the existing equipment? Answer:  We do not use software for our AED's. Question 3:  Why are no extra pads and extra batteries requested in the Solicitation as called for in Federal Guidelines for AED Programs.   Answer:  The synopsis/solicitation listed the customer's requirements.   Question 4:  Why is the requirement for a watertight carrying case? Answer:  To prevent water damage and provide additional protection while the unit is being transported to the outlying parts of the range. Question 5:  It appears there is a discrepancy on the carrying case part number.  Is the part number correct? Answer:  The correct part number has now changed to 3005384-003 and is being transitioned to 11998-000021.  It is no longer being called a Pelican case, just a hard shell, watertight, carrying case.  One of the above numbers needs to be associated with it so it will accommodate the LifePak 500.
