<DESC>The ACA, ITEC4 anticipates the issuance of a Draft Request for Proposals (RFP) W91QUZ-08-R-0021 for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-III to provide commercially available state-of-the-art, common, integrated structure for logistic tracking, locating, and health monitoring of commodities and assets of the Department of Defense (DoD).  In addition, Item Unique Identification (IUID) marking, data collection, storage information, retrieval methods, information processing, and transmission of transponder data will greatly enhance systems within the DoD.  All Active RFID (aRFID) hardware and software acquired under this contract shall be compliant with ISO 18000-7:2008 standards and the DoD Interoperability Guidelines.  RFID-III contracts will provide interoperable ISO/IEC 18000-7:2008 compliant aRFID hardware, software, documentation, and, services to authorized users worldwide.  Services include training, warranty and maintenance services, and technical engineering services (TES).  Hardware and software delivery and installation, as well as performance of associated training, warranty, maintenance, and documentation shall be required at continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) government sites.  Performance of TES shall be required at CONUS and OCONUS government sites and the contractor facility.   Turn-key solutions integrating technology purchased under the RFID-III contracts with existing Government provided AIT and Passive RFID shall be provided under TES Task Orders to provide a transparent solution to the User.  To support the warfighter in field operations, the RFID-III contract shall also provide transit cases to safely transport aRFID equipment and related accessories required to install and operate aRFID equipment.  The aRFID equipment is required to meet worldwide Department of Defense (DoD) and U. S. Coast Guard, NATO, Coalition Partners, and other Federal Agencies needs in various CONUS and OCONUS locations.  Since DoD components have shared RFID technology with Allied partners in joint operations, such as Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the RFID- III contract will be available for orders to meet Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirements in order to provide interoperability for logistics support with Allies.  The Government is contemplating multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contracts in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government anticipates that the acquisition will result in up to three awards.  The Government anticipates the release date of the draft RFP to the Army Single Face to Industry site https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ on or about 22 May 2008 with questions/comments regarding the solicitation due approximately 20 calendar days after issuance. Vendors shall submit questions/comments on the RFP to the ITEC4 Q&A Internet site (http://199.208.20.55/).  The POCs for contracting issues are Ms. Cathy Golden, 703-325-8936, at cathy.a.golden@conus.army.mil and Ms. Gloriana Fernandez, 703-325-3344, at gloriana.fernandez@conus.army.mil.

<DESC>The VA Upstate New York Healthcare Network (Veterans Integrated Service Network 2) campus at Albany, NY is seeking leased space to house its Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) Program.  The expected lease term will be for a base five-year term with one five-year option.  Occupancy is expected to begin no later than April 1, 2009.The CWT program is expected to occupy roughly 5,400 usable square feet.  This square footage is to include at least one conference room and break room, a reception area including a unisex customer restroom, at least six private offices and room for modular/temporary walls for additional office space.  Space should also include separate men's and women's staff restrooms outside of the reception area.The purpose of this space will be to offer counseling for Veterans in the CWT program, as well as offer some on-site vocational and employment opportunities.  As such, the space should also be able to accommodate a computer lab of roughly 550 usable square feet, a storage area for supplies and equipment, a loading dock or entry point for deliveries with its own entrance (preferably an overhead door with electric operator), and a suitable workshop area.  This workshop space will include a T-Shirt printing operation, which will necessitate the installation of exhaust screens/system for t-shirt drier and spot cleaning gun which will vent to outside, and a carbon filter system for washing out dye screens for silk screen washing booth.  These needs will be accomplished with Government-furnished equipment that will be connected to the building's utility systems.The Government will consider space requiring buildout prior to occupancy to meet these needs.  Buildout will either be paid in a lump sum or pro-rated across the base term of the lease.  Utilities, taxes, general maintenance, and snow plowing services are expected to be rolled into the monthly lease price.  Additionally, 10-15 parking spaces for staff, patients, and potentially Government-Owned Vehicles must be available.  This parking must be in a safe area, preferably private and/or enclosed.  Only space within five miles of the VA Medical Center campus at 113 Holland Ave., Albany NY 12208 will be considered.The VA does not pay broker fees or commission, and may not be represented by any party other than the Contracting Officer conducting this procurement.  All payments on leased space must be made in arrears, so standard monthly payments will be delivered on the first of each month for the previous month's occupancy.This space may be co-located with the upcoming lease for the Healthcare for Homeless Veterans program, solicitation number VA-528-08-RP-0268.The point of contact for this solicitation for offers is Mr. Jason White, Contract Specialist.  Mr. White may be contacted by email at Jason.white@va.gov, or by fax at 518-626-6849.  Please include "CWT Lease" in the subject line of your message/fax.  Interested parties should fax or email the details of their available space to Mr. White's attention not later than October 31, 2008.  Offers should include a point of contact, brief narrative description of the space, date available, photographs, and asking price per square foot.

<DESC>The mission of the Delta Leadership Institute (DLI) is to recognize, train and develop the leadership skills needed for the 21st Century and for the global challenges of the future in the eight state Delta region. The board of the Delta Regional Authority (DRA or the Authority) has initiated various programs to help the residents of the Delta to reach these goals. One of the priorities of the DRA is to improve the leadership skills of the regions current and future leaders. The Delta Leadership Institute is the vehicle through which the DRA will pursue these efforts. The result obtained from the implementation of the DLI programs will be the creation of a cadre of leaders that will work for future improvements in the region by thinking and acting regionally.
DRA has previously held four years of the DLI.  The purpose of this RFP is to expand and build upon DLI.  The focus of the executive academy training is on regional leadership and topics important to DRA and the Region such as health, information technology, transportation and education. DRA will require the contractor to secure prominent speakers on subject matters vital to the region at each of the meeting/sessions to be held in the DRA region where the participants of DLI will be exposed to issues/cultural history in each of the cities where the meetings/sessions are held and a cultural outing or business excursion be provided at every location.  Upon the completion of the Executive Academy the participants should possess the knowledge and skills necessary to make a direct impact in their community, county/parish, and state.

<CONTACT>Ron Loube, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 827-7031, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email Ronald.Loube@fda.hhs.gov - Terry Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7106, Email Terry.Frederick@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA intends to issue an RFP to provide non-clinical and clinical studies to assess the effects of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children, as well as overarching coordination and program management activities, in furtherance of the Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative.

FDAs mission is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nations food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.  FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by fostering innovations that make medical products more safe, effective, and affordable.  As part of its goal of fostering innovation, FDA seeks to identify and address those scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  A key aspect of the Agencys mission is to identify, and help address, potential safety concerns associated with all products under its jurisdiction and this includes the use of anesthetics and sedatives in pediatric patients.

Non-clinical studies in juvenile animal models have shown that exposure to some anesthetics and sedatives is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system, as well as memory and learning deficits.  Anesthetic agents that have been specifically implicated are NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, and GABA agonists, such as sevoflurane.  The anesthesia community and the FDA acknowledge that there are insufficient human data to either support or refute the clinical relevance of these findings for pediatric patients.  Therefore, additional non-clinical and clinical studies will be needed to assess the effect of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children.

The SAFEKIDS Initiative is a new requirement and will be a multi-phased, multi-year effort; however, the subject synopsis is expected to encompass only the initial phase of the overall initiative.  FDA anticipates soliciting proposals from entities capable of completing one or more of the following tasks/studies:

(1)  Assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric patients administered regional or general anesthesia as neonates or infants;

(2)  Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and short- and long-term neurotoxic effects of an anesthetic in infants undergoing various surgical procedures;

(3)  Assessment of the effects of anesthetic exposure on neurocognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes;

(4)  Assessment of long-term cognitive development following general anesthesia as an infant;

(5)  Evaluation of mechanisms of and potential prevention of neurotoxicity after administration of an inhalation anesthetic in an animal model; and

(6)  Development of an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support the creation and execution of a series of projects under the SAFEKIDS Initiative

The period of performance for each individual task order listed above is expected to be approximately 26 months from date of award.  Planning and performing studies to address the aforementioned issues will involve enormous challenges in terms of design, assurance of validity and reliability of the outcome measures, and ethical considerations.  Because it is unlikely that any one entity will possess all of the necessary expertise and resources to accomplish all work required under this requirement in a timely and efficient manner, it is expected that the services will be provided under an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Task Orders.  There is no predetermined number of awardees:  More than one individual task order may be awarded to a single deserving entity.

FDA anticipates (1) soliciting the services as a Full and Open competitive requirement:  Not as a set-aside for any specific class of business concern and (2) utilizing the procurement methods proscribed in FAR Part 15  Contracting by Negotiation.  The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.


The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be:  541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).


This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP).  FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around August 7, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page:  http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated proposal due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 6, 2008, and September 19, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative in order to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of two medical products launched within the past several years in at least two different health care databases for: (1) the number of patients identified as using each medical product each month in each health care database throughout the first year after launch; (2) a description of the patients using the product, and characteristics of that use (e.g., product strength, days supply and overall duration of use); (3) the time elapsed before 1 patient, 100 patients, 1000 patients, 10,000 patients and 100,000 patients could be identified in each database using these products; (4) identification of factors that influence the uptake of new medical products in each of the databases examined.  These analyses will be interpreted in the context of the population included and represented by the health care database to determine the generalizability of the findings to the nation as a whole.

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for important characteristics or minimum criteria relating to medical product uptake that could be considered when evaluating health care data systems for inclusion as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 8, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate existing signal detection methods that could be employed by the FDA in support of the Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will be responsible for the identification, description, and evaluation of existing signal detection methods that could be employed in the Sentinel Initiative.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of each methodologys: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics, and devices; (2) sensitivity, or ability to appropriately identify important safety signals; (3) specificity, or ability to appropriately identify the absence of important safety signals; (4) ability to minimize both false positive and false negative safety signals; (5) robustness of methodology to perform across different types of data systems for detection of different types of safety signals; (6) flexibility of the methodology to adapt to different situations and to change thresholds for different safety issues as desired and; (7) barriers that exist to using each identified methodology in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for further involvement of the most promising signal detection methodologies as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDAs Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a)	Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b)	Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c)	Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d)	Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data sources: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  At least fifty (50) percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  
This procurement envisions the award of two (2) Response Action Contract (RAC), one under full and open competition and one small business set-aside.  This announcement pertains to the unrestricted/full and open competition.  The small business set-aside project is issued under a separate announcement.  The contracts will be firm fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award term contracts.  The base period of performance will be three (3) years, with three  award terms periods, two (2) year, three (3) years and two (2) years, for a potential total period of ten (10) years.  Work will be issued by Task Orders.  The total estimated of this proposed contract, including award terms, is $110,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to issue multiple awards under either of the procurement announcements, the unrestricted and/or the small business set-aside.
The contract will be awarded in accordance with the Brooks Act Procurement procedures.  For this procurement, EPA requires that the offerors organize the information so as to highlight responses to the technical Evaluation Criteria.  Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed Standard Form 330 (SF 330) to the office shown below by June 29, 2007, 2:00 PM Pacific Time.

	There is no prohibition against a firm participating in both the RAC full and open competition and the RAC small set-aside.  All proposals will be evaluated in an identical manner and in accordance with specified evaluation criteria.   The Government does not envision awarding contracts to a respective firm that would be the Prime or Sub-contractor in both the full and open and the set-aside procurements.  Pursuant to FAR 36.6, the source selection official has the latitude to consider selection of another of the ranked offerers.  Rationale for considering such action could be the Governments goal to provide alternate sources for its requirements, including the mitigation and management of conflict of interest (COI) issues.  In the event that firms propose under a joint venture agreement, both firms must demonstrate the ability to implement the requirements of the tasks described in the Statement of Work independently. 

	The EPA Region 9 is not going to hold a pre-proposal conference.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, the RFP will be posted shortly on the EPA web site for informational purposes only.  A bidders list will not be provided or posted.  Following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed.  Short listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."  Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The specific details on the oral presentations will only be provided to the selected firms.  Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations.  Following oral presentations, the proposals will then be ranked and the source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms.  The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan, Representations and Certifications, and Subcontracting Plan.  The contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs. 

Selection will be based on the following evaluation criteria which are listed in descending order of importance:

Factor #1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE (AS PRESENDTED IN SECTION E, G, H, AND PART II OF FIRM?S SF 330)
	Sub-Factor #1	Fund-Lead Site Specific Work Areas

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Government intends to award a noncompetitive acquisition using procedures authorized by FAR Parts 6 and 12, and subpart 13.5, for software, on-line training, and certification in the DocuManager software from Evolusoft, as part of a project with the government of Panama under the Department's international narcotics and law enforcement program. 

This notice is not a request for quotations; this acquisition will be processed using the authority in FAR 6.302-1.  Justification for other than full and open competition is that the U.S. Government requires needs the 1,850 companies operating in the Colon Free Zone in Panama to learn and use the existing DocuManager software installed by Evolusoft to assist in money laundering detection, prevention, and reporting, and only Evolusoft can meet the requirement. The DocuManager software is already in use at various law enforcement agencies of the Government of Panama, so no other source would be compatible with ongoing operations.

Solicitation is not available at this time. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to change the acquisition strategy.

The AN/ASN-157 DNSs to be acquired are used to replace earlier generation DNSs that are still in use on various aircraft platforms. The DNS is essential to the operation of the Apache, Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters. Without this equipment, the helicopters are non-mission capable and, therefore, they would not be available to support critical mission operations. Currently, the contracts period of performance is from 8 January 2006 through 8 January 2011. Though the government possesses a performance specification, BAE is the only known manufacturer in the current marketplace that has the intimate knowledge of the antenna, calibration data and circuit design to build the DNS that meets the Armys form, fit and function as described in the performance specification. <BR><BR>Any updates to this synopsis will be posted to the website maintained at the CECOM LCMC, Fort Monmouth, Interactive Business Opportunities Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a contract on an other than full and open competition basis with Meso Scale Discovery, 9238 Gaither Road, Gaithersburg MD 20877.  The requirement is to perform cytokine and chemokines assays.  The services were awarded competitively to Meso Scale Discovery in 2007 and now additional services are required in support of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIIDs) Research Project 07-18 entitled Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed  A Systems Biology Approach to Determining the Factors Mediating Safety and Immunogenicity.  It is paramount that this research projects results be scientifically sound and therefore capable of withstanding the greatest amount of scientific question and scrutiny.  The only way to ensure the consistency and scientific merit of the tests is for them to be performed by the same source.  Minute differences in results of these kinds of tests occur between sources.  Those small differences between vendors are enough to compromise the science. Therefore, the same source must perform all small protein panel assays, throughout this research project.  The recruiting and enrollment of male volunteers for the protocol has already begun.  This protocol is currently being amended to include female volunteers, in addition to the male volunteers.  It is now anticipated that only 750 of the 900 samples of the original award will be those of the male volunteers.  The remaining 150 samples of the original award and the 600 samples included in this modification will be those of the female volunteers.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responses to this synopsis must be provided in writing and include qualifications, experience, past performance and proposed costs to provide this type of services.  All responses will be considered be reviewed and considered for future requirements of this type.  Your responses should be provided by 5:00 pm Eastern Standard time on Friday September 26, 2008.  Provide responses to pamela.nevels@amedd.army.mil.

This is a continuance of the services awarded to JHU in support of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIIDs) Research Project 07-18 entitled Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed  A Systems Biology Approach to Determining the Factors Mediating Safety and Immunogenicity and USAMRIIDs Research Project 05-27 entitled Correlation of Antibody Levels and TNA Levels to HLA Haplotypes Genotypes in Recipients of the Anthrax Vaccine, II.  It is paramount that these research projects results be scientifically sound and therefore capable of withstanding the greatest amount of scientific question and scrutiny.  The only way to ensure the consistency and scientific merit of the tests is for them to be performed by the same source.  Minute differences in results of these kinds of tests occur between sources.  Those small differences between vendors are enough to compromise the science. Therefore, the same source must perform all of the HLA typing throughout these research projects. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responses to this synopsis must be provided in writing and include qualifications, experience, past performance and proposed costs to provide this type of services.  All responses will be considered be reviewed and considered for future requirements of this type.  Your responses should be provided by 5:00 pm Eastern Standard time on Friday September 26, 2008.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a contract on an other than full and open competition basis with Metabolon, 800 Capitola, Suite 1, Durham, NC 27713.   The required services entail the evaluation of the metabolomics profile in the blood of human female volunteers vaccinated against Bacillus anthracis with the Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA).   Metabolon is uniquely qualified to provide a global, chemocentric metabolomic service using its proprietary database of known biochemical compounds that allow for the identification of biochemicals used to understand both affected and unaffected biochemical pathways.  Metabolomics services from other sources are targeted, not global, and look for discrete biochemicals or have an ion-centric, instead of chemocentric, approach so they do not identify compounds, nor provide biochemical pathway analysis.  Metabolon also performs metabolomic analysis using liquid and/or gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, as well as proprietary visualization and interpretation software for data analysis.   In this instance, the services must be obtained from Metabolon as the same services for the human male Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed blood samples were awarded to and will be performed by Metabolon, Inc.  The services awarded to Metabolon in 2007 and the now required services are both part of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIIDs) Research Project 07-18 entitled Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed  A Systems Biology Approach to Determining the Factors Mediating Safety and Immunogenicity.  It is paramount that this research projects results be scientifically sound and therefore capable of withstanding the greatest amount of scientific question and scrutiny.  The only way to insure the consistency and scientific merit of the profiles is for them to be performed by the same source.  Therefore, the same source must perform all of the metabolomic profiling throughout this research project.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a contract on an other than full and open competition basis with Cogenics Inc, 5 Science Park, New ahven CT 06511.  The required services entail the performance of (1) microarray generation: RNA extraction, Affymetrix genechip, NuGen Ovation Whole Blood Solution protocol, relative QPCR, ABI gene expression, and custom assay design; and (2) genotyping:  DNA extraction, Illumina Human 1M  Duo Beadchip, and Illumina genotyping; and (3) custom data analysis of both the microarray and genotyping.  These services were awarded competitively to Cogenics in 2007 in support of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIIDs) Research Project 07-18 entitled Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed  A Systems Biology Approach to Determining the Factors Mediating Safety and Immunogenicity.

Those small differences between vendors are enough to compromise the science. Therefore, the same source must perform all microarray and genomics tests, as well as data analysis, throughout this research project.  The recruiting and enrollment of male volunteers for the protocol has already begun.  This protocol is currently being amended to include female volunteers, in addition to the male volunteers, thus doubling the number of study samples and required testing.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a contract on an other than full and open competition basis with GenPhar Inc, 871 Lowcountry Boulevard, Mount Pleasant SC.  The specific objective of this procurement action is to procure sufficient quantities of filovirus vaccine components, EBO7 and M8, to complete the evaluation process under 1.1C0001_07_RD_B.  Additionally, we would like to have components developed for Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV) that will produce antigen for ELISAs and we would want sufficient quantities of GP antigen (ZEBOV, SEBOV and MARV) produced for evaluation in a validated ELISA down-selection The USAMRIID has been engaged in the research and development of a multivalent filovirus vaccine with GenPhar, Inc. for over seven and a half years.  Much of this collaboration was done through a Cooperative Agreement which had a performance period end date of 31 May 2007.  We are now in a final period of evaluation of this multivalent filovirus vaccine and need additional vaccine doses of the same type and consistency to complete our studies.  Another contractor would be unable to provide USAMRIID will equivalent product.  GenPhar has also produced other components that for evaluation.  One of these components, EBO3, has shown the ability to produce Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP) antigen in sufficient quality and quantity to have value to USAMRIID in the development of validated ELISAs for filoviruses.  Because of this experience and proven ability to deliver a product that meets the governments needs, GenPhar is the optimal source for the development of these reagents.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responses to this synopsis must be provided in writing and include qualifications, experience, past performance and proposed costs to provide this type of services.  All responses will be considered be reviewed and considered for future requirements of this type.  Your responses should be provided by 5:00 pm Eastern Standard time on Friday September 26, 2008.

<p>National Security Technologies (NSTec) manages operations at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) and its related facilities and laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration/Nevada Site Office (NNSA/NSO). <span style="mso-font-kerning: 11.0pt">NSTec is responsible for the NNSA/NSO telecommunications systems.</span></p>
<p>More than two-thirds of the NSTec's employees work in Las Vegas, North Las Vegas (NLV), or at the NTS (located 65 miles north of Las Vegas). NSTec has remote offices in Livermore, California; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Santa Barbara, California; and Andrews AFB, Maryland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Communications capabilities are a critical issue in the support and maintenance of the NSTec's projects. A telecommunications infrastructure is in place to service the level of requirements specified within this document. The current environment for the NTS complex includes a Nortel communications server CS&#8209;2100 at the core of the telephony system with a Nortel SL 100 networked to the CS&#8209;2100. The infrastructure consists of the SL100/CS&#8209;2100 switch and subtended Private Branch Exchange (PBX), Cisco Call Managers, microwave system, portable microwave systems, NTS Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), copper and fiber optic cable plant, and voicemail. The bulk of the users operate on either analog or digital phones. Currently, there are approximately 400 users directly operating off the CS&#8209;2100 using Nortel Internet Protocol (IP) telephony. Users at the NTS are connected through Remote Line Card Module (RLCM) units back to the SL100/CS&#8209;2100 at the NLV site. There are approximately 100&nbsp;users at the NTS that have telephony services via Cisco call management connections. Other locations in the Las Vegas area use various options of the Nortel Meridian 1 systems, while three of the remote locations have a Nortel CS&#8209;1000 installed and the fourth has a Nortel Norstar system. Detailed descriptions of each system are included in Appendix A of the Scope of Work.</p>

<DESC><p>Proposed addition of Stock Title Stamps to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Stock Title Stamps by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7520-00-NSH-0129<br />7520-00-NSH-0130<br />7520-00-NSH-0131<br />7520-00-NSH-0132<br />7520-00-NSH-0133<br />7520-00-NSH-0134<br />7520-00-NSH-0135<br />7520-00-NSH-0136<br />7520-00-NSH-0137<br />7520-00-NSH-0138<br />7520-00-NSH-0139<br />7520-00-NSH-0140<br />7520-00-NSH-0141<br />7520-00-NSH-0142<br />7520-00-NSH-0143<br />7520-00-NSH-0144<br />7520-00-NSH-0145<br />7520-00-NSH-0146<br />7520-00-NSH-0147</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS Office Supply Center, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Stock Title Stamps to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>"Faxed" - Light Green<br />"Paid" - Light Green<br />"Void" - Light Green<br />"For Deposit Only" - Light Green<br />"File Copy" - Light Green<br />"E-Mailed" - Light Green<br />"Mailed" - Light Green<br />"Revised" - Light Green<br />"Enclosure" - Red<br />"Sensitive-BU" - Red<br />"For Official Use Only" - Black<br />"Classified" - Red<br />"MICAP" - Red<br />"For Training Only" - Black<br />"NOFORN" - Black<br />"Secret/ACCM" - Red<br />"USDA Forest Service" - Black<br />"United States Treasury" - Back<br />"Army Standard" - Red</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 8, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection intends to contract with Hornady Manufacturing Company, Grand Island, NE for AMAX TAP Ammunition (308 168 gr).  The quantity will be 50,000 rounds.  There will be an option quantity of 25,000 rounds also included in the subject contract.
Sole Source Justification: The statutory authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The OBP/Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) supplies the ammunition to PM/Os for all Sector SRT teams; there is no contract to purchase more PM/O ammunition at this time.  As a Federal Law Enforcement agency it is our responsibility to insure the most up to date and effective tools are made available to Agents in the field. No other manufacturer produces a similar round that meets the standards and capabilities required by Border Patrol PM/Os. The TAP round provides Border Patrol PM/Os operational effectiveness and insures the safety of the public.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no formal solicitation package is available.  However prospective contractors who believe they can successfully propose must provide specific detailed technical documentation to support such claims of abilities.  No award will be made on the basis of any proposal or other information received in response to this notice, and this is a notification of intent to acquire supplies/services and not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Applied Science Laboratories under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION*1.  Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:Research Program trans # 523-08-4-9184-0644*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:Purchase of upgrades and enhancements to the Geriatric Neuropsychology Labs ASL eyetracking system*3.  Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):In order to perform more complex studies with our existing ASL eyetracker, we require several enhancements.  The items we would like to purchase include an upgraded control unit, a head mounted display and miniature optics. Estimated Value: $51,022.104.	  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source.*5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:Our lab has been using ASL eyetracking software and hardware for the past ten years.  Many of our protocols have been designed specifically to integrate with the ASL system.  The hardware purchase proposed would enhance the current system thus avoiding the prohibitive cost of an entirely new system.  The new hardware would be easily integrated into the current system.  We have also designed analytic routines and customized experiments that interface with proprietary functions of the ASL system.  It would require considerable software development to use a different system.  The costs of this development would easily approach the 30-50K mark.  Additionally, data would not be directly comparable with previous studies.  New studies build on data collected from previous studies.  To employ a new system would require us to repeat many studies simply to establish the reliability and comparability of the data collected.The combination of integrated eyetracking optics in a Head Mounted Display (HMD) will provide precise data presentation and acquisition unmatched control over environmental factors in all behavioral experiments.  Participants will be completely immersed in a visual world where the experimenter can control the minutest parameters.  Previously, attempts at control of the participants visual environment have been daunting; relying on expensive customized testing spaces.  No matter the budget, these spaces never provide the desired flexibility and accuracy that may be achieved with the requested equipment*6.  Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:The following vendors (include phone number and contact name) were contacted; however were unable to provide these services:This device is necessary for our specific research project, and propriety, patented technology by the device manufacturer, Applied Science Laboratories is the ONLY source of this product for this research project.7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:Determination was conducted and the anticipated cost to the government is fair and reasonable based on commercial price at $57,585.00 and discounted price for government is 51,250.65 this is 11% off H-VRS-nvis list price.*8.  Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:A market survey was not conducted due to the fact that this is the only system currently available on the market capable of being used for our specific needs. These details of these unique features are described under section 3 and 5 above.*9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as  an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.The purchase requested is an upgrade to our existing system.  We will save on the approximately 30K in hardware costs by upgrading as opposed to purchasing a new system.  Existing experimental protocols could be invalidated by the move to a new system.  We do not have the funds to purchase a new system.  ASL is the only vendor that can provide upgrades to their own equipment.*10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in the acquisition:None only one source*11.  A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:Contracting Activity will continue to encourage brand name or equivalent specifications.

Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:A market survey was not conducted due to the fact that this is the only system currently available on the market capable of being used for our specific needs. *9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as  an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.Lucy 3D Phantom is only manufactured by Standard Imaging, and the only vendor  *10.

The offers must state details clin by clin that the vendor can meet the salient characteristics.  <BR>d.	***If the vendors do not detail in their RFQ/offer their verification that they can meet the salient characteristics clin by clin the vendor will not have met the most important evaluation factor of Technical Acceptability/Capability.<BR>2.	Price: Price is the second most important factor after technical acceptability/capability<BR>3.	Past Performance: Past Performance is the third most important factor. The  Government Evaluation Factor in terms of past performance will be ensuring the vendors have no negative information on the Excluded Parties List. https://www.epls.gov/<BR>4.	Manufacturers Warranty: Warranty is the fourth most important factor. The Government Evaluation Factor will require the vendor provide a one year limited warranty to repair defects in materials.<BR>***Evaluation Process Summary*******: <BR>1.Technical Acceptibility/Capability will be significantly weighed higher than price. <BR>       2. The Government will award the contract to the vendor that RFQ/offers the overall best value to the Government. Best Value is defined as the  Governments Evaluation of all factors technical acceptibility/capability, price, past performance and Warranty. <BR>Technical Acceptability/Capability are significantly more important than price.  ALTHOUGH PRICE IS NOT FORMALLY SCORED, IT IS IMPORTANT AND CANNOT BE IGNORED.  THE DEGREE OF ITS IMPORTANCE WILL INCREASE WITH THE DEGREE OF EQUALITY OF THE PROPOSALS IN RELATION TO EVALUATION FACTORS.  All factors must be at least satisfactory to be considered for award.<BR><BR>Offerors should note that in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, entitled Instructions to OfferorsCommercial Items, the Government intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received without discussions.  Offerors should therefore ensure that their initial proposal contains their best offer from both a price and technical standpoint, and should not assume that discussions will be conducted.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<BR><BR>If discussions become necessary following the initial evaluation, the competitive range may be limited.  <BR><BR>The following are the standard evaluation adjectival ratings used by HCAA Contracting Offices: <BR><BR>EXCELLENT<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The proposal has no weaknesses.  Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or no risk to the Government.<BR><BR>GOOD<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal Contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of meeting the requirements with little risk to the Government.<BR><BR>SATISFACTORY<BR>The RFQ/offer demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses.  The proposal has some weakness that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special Contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of meeting the requirements.<BR><BR>MARGINAL<BR>The RFQ/offer fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special Contractor emphasis, and close Government monitoring. <BR><BR>UNSATISFACTORY<BR>The RFQ/offer fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.<BR><BR>(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of a RFQ/offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the RFQ/offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR><BR>The following are the standard evaluation adjectival ratings used by Health Care Acquisition Activity (HCAA) Contracting Offices for Past Performance:<BR><BR>LOW RISK<BR>Based on offerors past performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>MODERATE RISK<BR>Based on the offerors past performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>HIGH RISK<BR>Based on the offerors past performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<BR><BR>UNKNOWN RISK<BR>No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.

<DESC>USAID seeks a Personal Services Contractor who can provide immediate assistance as a Democracy and Governance Field Advisor (GS/13).  The worldwide nature of DG's program requires a DG Field Advisor who can provide immediate consultation on DG projects. The proper execution of DG programs demands that an individual with managerial and operational skills is available for short-term critical work in Washington and the field, determined on a case by case basis, to perform specific operational and advisory functions.  In the capacity of DG Field Advisor the incumbent will be responsible for the following types of activities abroad where DG country programs are in place: assessing the needs of the DG program, evaluating the work of the grantee, and ensuring the various USG interests are coordinated and policy implemented. The Field Advisor will consult with the Deputy Director/CTO, or designee, on a regular basis to develop a clear and coherent basis from which to implement programmatic changes and needs.  Assisting in Washington and/or the field with new country program start-ups, providing operational support in periods of need, review and evaluation of ongoing projects, and country-program closeouts will be of particular importance in the work of the Field Advisor.

<DESC><p>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB has a requirement to upgrade mulitple fire alarm systems with the items listed in the equipment list below. This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
NOTE, AS CHANGED BY THIS MODIFICATION:  This is a BRAND NAME requirement for FIRE CONTROL INSTRUMENTS (FCI) products (THIS IS NOT A SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT). Justification: Fire Control Instruments (FCI) manufactures and E3 series fire alarm panel and associated devices that operate location specific, have the interface capability necessary to communicate with existing FCI panels; have an expansion capability for future upgrades and will communicate with the FCI Focal Point Gateway System being upgraded at the base fire department. The panel, gateway interface and addressable devices must be compatible with existing FCI panels located in the majority of facilities throughout RAFB. This compatibility issue is significant in that fire alarm equipment must be reliable and communicate properly. Different manufacturers of fire alarm equipment have different protocols for each of their company's equipment. If different systems are installed with different protocols communication errors occur and prevent the devices from sending exact locations of alarms and also create false alarms that endanger firemen needlessly when responding to these false alarms while in an emergency mode. FCI is the only known system that gives us maximum communication compatibility, specific location of that alarm before the fire trucks even roll from the station, and assists us in achieving the 50% reduction of false alarms mandated by Air Force.   (Equipment list includes products other than FCI that were selected to go with the FCI products)  NOTE: </p>
<p>This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number F3P3AH8250A004 is issued as a request for quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect with the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Mast-Climbers-Scaffolding,MMN08254174Q1 which was posted on 8/27/2008. You are notified that the followingquestions and answers are posted; 1.QUESTIONIn your Statement of Work (SOW) document, under Information and Requirements ToVendors Item #7 says The main platform straight extensions shall have the capability ofhaving hand rails on both sides and end when being used other than what is shown ondrawing 90M12310. Does this mean you just want to make sure that the extensions have thecapability of having hand rails in the future or do you want us to figure in the proposalprice four sided hand rail so you will have hand rails for both sides and ends for theplatform in a straight configuration?  ANSWERWe need the hand rails figured in the proposal price because we will use the mastclimbers in the straight configuration before we use them in the two tower configuration.2.QUESTIONIn your Statement of Work (SOW) document, the word hardware is used throughout. UnderTo Be Sent With Initial Bids Item #1 says Drawings or sketches, with dimensions, ofhardware that will be used to anchor mast to floor. Is this referring to the anchoringbolt system that will be used to anchor the base of the mast to the concrete floor onsite?  ANSWERThis is referring to the anchor system and the base itself.3.QUESTIONItem #2 says Drawings or sketches, with base dimensions, of hardware that can be moved,to support mast in configuration other than what will be used to anchor mast to floor.Is the word hardware referring to a typical base that is used to level and support themast climbing work platform when in its straight configuration?  ANSWER  Yes4.QUESTIONItem #5 says List of all hardware that will be delivered to MSFC with price quote andtime estimated for delivery.	     Is this list supposed to show every itemized piece, nuts, bolts, clamps etc or just themajor components that will be required per your criteria?    ANSWERMajor components5.QUESTIONIf this contract is awarded to a non American manufacturer will the factory trainers, nonAmerican citizens, from its factory be allowed to train your employees the properinstallation and operating training required on their product at the Marshall SpaceFlight Center? If so what would be the requirements prior to their arrival?  ANSWERNASA will have to enter them into our visitors system as foreign nationals. They will beable to come on center, but there are certain rules they have to follow as foreignnationals.  NASA will also need certain information from them and it takes about a monthto get them cleared.6.QUESTIONOn drawing #90M12310, plan view of single rocket setting, south side of drawing, twodimensions left and right of the center of the mast section. The dimension is 61.7 fromthe center of the mast section to the beginning of the gate sections. Is this forreference only or is this a critical dimension. If critical, is it purpose to locate thegate? What are the tolerances?  ANSWERBecause of where the mast climbers set in the test stand this is the best place for us toaccess them.  We have to design ramps to access the mast climbers form the platformsinside the test stand, so we have to know where the gates are before the mast climbersget here.  The tolerance could be plus or minus 1/4 of an inch.7.QUESTIONDo we have to do a quotation for the anchorage system?  ANSWER  Yes8.QUESTIONCan we use the Nasa crane (the red and white one)?  ANSWER  Yes9.QUESTIONDo the motors have to be able to lift the nominal payload or 4 time X payload?  ANSWERThe motors need to lift the nominal pay load. The platforms will have the 4:1 safetyfactor.10.QUESTIONWhich level of unbalanced nominal load we have to take into account?  ANSWERNot knowing what all kinds of loading will be put on the mast climbers during operationsinside the test stand,	can only give an estimate. Let's say at maximum load, 2/3 of theload on one side and 1/3 on the other.	This would be in the straight single tower andcircular configurations.11.QUESTIONDo we have to apply the coefficient 4 for the moment (torque) as well?  ANSWER  No12.QUESTIONIs the overload control device required?   ANSWER    Yes13.QUESTIONIf yes which precision are they asking for?   ANSWERIf this means sensitivity of the overload device as a load tolerance;the assumption is+/- 200lbs.14. QUESTIONIs the moment/torque control device required?    ANSWER    Yes15.QUESTIONIf yes which precision are they asking for?   ANSWERSame as answer 13;If this means sensitivity of the overload device as a loadtolerance;the assumption is +/- 200lbs.16.QUESTIONWhich level of wind force do we have to take into account for the calculation?  ANSWERAccording to the International building code the wind velocity to design to in this areais 90 m.p.h. The mast climbers will be mostly block from the wind.  The test towerdeflects 10 in. at the 360 ft. level during 70 m.ph. winds.17.QUESTIONDoes the equipment have to descend (out of service condition) or have to remain in heightwhen there is a strong wind or hurricane?  ANSWERThe mast climbers can descend to about 24 feet when not in use.The due date for quotes is not extended; due 9/30/2008.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDAs Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is part of the Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  One of the areas that the TAG is charged with is improving the effectiveness of OFDAs programs by strengthening OFDAs capacity to assess and evaluate the impact of programs.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires an Evaluation and Reporting Coordinator (E&R Coordinator) to lead and coordinate OFDA assessment and evaluation efforts, organize and participate in the Agency reporting requirements such as the Congressional Budget Justification, Operational Plan & Performance Report, Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking System (FACTS) data entry, fiscal year operating budgets, PART (Program Assessment Rating Tool), and Strategic Planning.  In addition, the E&R Coordinator will analyze program effectiveness, share programmatic information with other offices, and serve in a significant capacity as a member of the OFDA Grants Working Group.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL DACS08P2170

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


Q1: In Section V, Deliverables, of the above referenced Request for Proposal, are proposing companies allowed any latitude on the deliverable schedules?

A1: The timeline for the deliverables found in section C.V (page 9) are fixed and there should be no deviation. 

Q2: May we ask what the selection criteria to judge commercial potential may be to get to the short list of grantees eligible for the proposed program? Could you be as specific as possible, e.g., criteria, individuals and their backgrounds relative to development and application of the criteria before passing the short list on to the contractor?

A2: The selection criteria for the short list (40 grantees) is not publicly available.  The 40 grantees will represent typical NSF Phase II grantees. 

Q3: How many industry sectors may be represented by a shortlisted selection of grantees?

A3: All industry sectors that the NSF SBIR currently supports will be represented in the group of companies the contract will support. 

Q4: Do you have any insights on the geographic range of grantees?

A4: The grantees are from across the nation. 

Q5: In Section B.2 and again in the SOW Section C.II:  The RFP states the quantity of grantees to be 40 per year.  However, it is not clear how long the contractor is required to work with each set of 40 grantees.  Can this be clarified?

A5: The engagement will typically start at the beginning of the Phase II award and will last throughout the life of the Phase II/IIB project. 

Q6: In Section M.3.III Factor 3 - Past Performance: Can the score be less than neutral if the proposal evaluation deems the past performance not relevant? 

A6: The neutral score will be assigned only to offerors with no prior past history.  Pursuant to FAR 15.305 (2) (iv), in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  

Q7 : In Section C.B Component Two: IP Assessment Tool: 
a.        Does regular access mean periodic or constant access to the analysis tools? 
b.        Is the NSF requesting on-line, on-demand access to an IP search and analysis tool or IP search and analysis as performed by the contractor?

A7: a. The offeror should provide sufficient access to ensure that the IP strategy can be maintained/enhanced throughout the period of performance of the resulting contract.

A7: b. NSF is requesting a process and on-line tool to enable maintenance/enhancement of the IP strategy throughout the period of performance of the resulting contract. 

Q8: Does the 12 point font requirement extend to the mentor write-ups as well, or may we use smaller fonts there?  A smaller point would allow some of the longer bios/resumes to fit on one page without editing.

A8: The 12 pt font requirement is maintained throughout the entire response.

Q9: Does the requirement call for support of Phase IIB grantees, in addition to Phase II grantees?  Or does it call only for providing commercialization to Phase II grantees?

A9: The engagement will typically start at the beginning of the Phase II award and will last throughout the life of the Phase II/IIB project.

Q10. With regard to the $6.5 million business size standard, does this refer to the annual revenues notation in CCR and ORCA filings, or some minimum business size standard NSF requires?

A10.  Pursuant to FAR 19.102 (a), the Small Business Administration (SBA) establishes the small business size standards on an industry-by-industry basis.  

Q11. We have a GSA (MOBIS 874-1) contracting vehicle.  

A11. This procurement is being conducted using the procedures established at FAR 15  Contracting by Negotiation.  FAR 8.404, Use of Federal Supply Schedules is not applicable in this instance.

<DESC>This modification action is for the extension of the contract period from 30 September 2008 to 30 December 2008 to the Corporate Contract between DLA and Oshkosh Truck Corporation SP075002D9720.  This project was initiated to ensure continued coverage on the provided list of NSNs while awaiting the award of the Oshkosh successor contract initiative.  The contract is a long-term contract, currently in its 7th and final option year.  All NSNs are available through the primary point of contact, Veronica Godbott at veronica.godbott@dla.mil.  Items will be procured as All or None per NSN.  All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.  Note(s): 12 and 26 are applicable.    Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not posses complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Approved sources are: Oshkosh Truck.  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors described in the solicitation.  All terms and conditions as indicated in the contract remain for the previously specified extension period. NSNs to be covered under this project include:

This Justification and Approval(J&A) is for procurement of Precise Biometrics' Biometric and Smart Card Readers on abrand name only basis. The State Department PKI program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware(smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part ofa PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNetCryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability ofthe components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise mayprove non-functional in this configuration. As such, there is no guarantee that other readerswill support the PKI/BLADE configuration. Precise will only provide support for products purchased from Precise authorized resellers. Ifthere are support issues on products not purchased through these resellers, they will defer tothe supplier of the product. Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part ofthestandard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently hasinstalled. Installation of different software versions may have the following issues:1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers.Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it.3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE orfuture modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative, Phase I
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-SAFEKIDSInitiativePhaseI
<RESPDATE>090808
<ARCHDATE>09192008
<CONTACT>Ron Loube, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 827-7031, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email Ronald.Loube@fda.hhs.gov - Terry Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7106, Email Terry.Frederick@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA is issuing the subject Request for Proposals (RFP) to provide non-clinical and clinical studies to assess the effects of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children, as well as overarching coordination and program management activities, in furtherance of the Safety of Key Inhaled and Intravenous Drugs in Pediatrics (SAFEKIDS) Initiative.

FDAs mission is to protect the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nations food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.  FDA is also responsible for advancing the public health by fostering innovations that make medical products more safe, effective, and affordable.  As part of its goal of fostering innovation, FDA seeks to identify and address those scientific and technical obstacles to the optimum development of safe and therapeutically important medical products.  A key aspect of the Agencys mission is to identify, and help address, potential safety concerns associated with all products under its jurisdiction and this includes the use of anesthetics and sedatives in pediatric patients.

Non-clinical studies in juvenile animal models have shown that exposure to some anesthetics and sedatives is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system, as well as memory and learning deficits.  Anesthetic agents that have been specifically implicated are NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, and GABA agonists, such as sevoflurane.  The anesthesia community and the FDA acknowledge that there are insufficient human data to either support or refute the clinical relevance of these findings for pediatric patients.  Therefore, additional non-clinical and clinical studies will be needed to assess the effect of anesthetics and sedatives on the developing human brain, including long-term studies in neonates and young children.

The SAFEKIDS Initiative is a new requirement and will be a multi-phased, multi-year effort; however, the subject synopsis is expected to encompass only the initial phase of the overall initiative.  FDA is soliciting proposals from entities capable of completing one or more of the following tasks/studies:

(1)  Assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in pediatric patients administered regional or general anesthesia as neonates or infants;

(2)  Assessment of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and short- and long-term neurotoxic effects of an anesthetic in infants undergoing various surgical procedures;

(3)  Assessment of the effects of anesthetic exposure on neurocognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes;

(4)  Assessment of long-term cognitive development following general anesthesia as an infant;

(5)  Evaluation of mechanisms of and potential prevention of neurotoxicity after administration of an inhalation anesthetic in an animal model; and

(6)  Development of an administrative and scientific infrastructure to support the creation and execution of a series of projects under the SAFEKIDS Initiative

The period of performance for each individual task order listed above will be approximately 26 months from date of award.  Planning and performing studies to address the aforementioned issues will involve enormous challenges in terms of design, assurance of validity and reliability of the outcome measures, and ethical considerations.  The services will be provided under a  Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract.  There is no predetermined number of awardees:  More than one individual project may be awarded to a single deserving entity.

This is a Full and Open competitive requirement:  Not as a set-aside for any specific class of business concern and (2) utilizing the procurement methods proscribed in FAR Part 15  Contracting by Negotiation.  The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.


The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is:  541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services (Small Business Size:  $6.5M).  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).


This announcement is an active RFP.  The proposal due date is September 8, 2008, at 1:00PM, Eastern Time.  The anticipated award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 19, 2008.

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Timeliness of Medical Update for Surveillance in Health Care Databases
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-MedicalUptake_HealthCareDatabases
<ARCHDATE>09192008
<CONTACT>Terry Frederick, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-7043, Fax 301-827-7106, Email terry.frederick@fda.hhs.gov - Ron Loube, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 827-7031, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email Ronald.Loube@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative in order to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of two medical products launched within the past several years in at least two different health care databases for: (1) the number of patients identified as using each medical product each month in each health care database throughout the first year after launch; (2) a description of the patients using the product, and characteristics of that use (e.g., product strength, days supply and overall duration of use); (3) the time elapsed before 1 patient, 100 patients, 1000 patients, 10,000 patients and 100,000 patients could be identified in each database using these products; (4) identification of factors that influence the uptake of new medical products in each of the databases examined.  These analyses will be interpreted in the context of the population included and represented by the health care database to determine the generalizability of the findings to the nation as a whole.

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for important characteristics or minimum criteria relating to medical product uptake that could be considered when evaluating health care data systems for inclusion as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 2, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate existing signal detection methods that could be employed by the FDA in support of the Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will be responsible for the identification, description, and evaluation of existing signal detection methods that could be employed in the Sentinel Initiative.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of each methodologys: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics, and devices; (2) sensitivity, or ability to appropriately identify important safety signals; (3) specificity, or ability to appropriately identify the absence of important safety signals; (4) ability to minimize both false positive and false negative safety signals; (5) robustness of methodology to perform across different types of data systems for detection of different types of safety signals; (6) flexibility of the methodology to adapt to different situations and to change thresholds for different safety issues as desired and; (7) barriers that exist to using each identified methodology in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for further involvement of the most promising signal detection methodologies as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 2, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate potential data sources and/or data environments that could participate in the FDAs Sentinel Initiative.

Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification, description, and evaluation of potential data sources and/or data environments that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data sources: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics (excluding blood and tissue products), and devices; (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow up and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for post-market product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; and (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for further involvement of the most promising data sources and/or environments as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.

The Period of Performance will be Six Months from date of award.  The award type will be Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is Full and Open.  The Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the Basis of Award will be Best Value.

The primary location of performance will be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor will be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDAs Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.

The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a)	Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b)	Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c)	Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d)	Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data sources: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in FDAs Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.  

The awardee will be required to complete the following tasks:

(1.) Develop a comprehensive requirements document detailing actual user needs for monitoring medical product performance throughout its entire life cycle in order to protect and promote the public health. 

(2.) Define possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative.  This should include, but not be limited to, distributed and federated models.  The list of models to be defined should be developed in consultation with the Agency.

(3.) Compare and contrast the identified database models with the user needs documented in the detailed requirements documents.  Characterize the advantages and disadvantages of the models identified in #2 for the intended use of postmarketing surveillance as envisioned by the Sentinel Initiative.

<DESC>The FDA is issuing this Request for Quotations (RFQ) to define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in FDAs Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will define and critically evaluate possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative as it evolves to enhance the performance and findings of the system.  

The awardee will be required to complete the following tasks:

(1.) Develop a comprehensive requirements document detailing actual user needs for monitoring medical product performance throughout its entire life cycle in order to protect and promote the public health. 

(2.) Define possible database models that should be considered for use in the Sentinel Initiative.  This should include, but not be limited to, distributed and federated models.  The list of models to be defined should be developed in consultation with the Agency.

(3.) Compare and contrast the identified database models with the user needs documented in the detailed requirements documents.  Characterize the advantages and disadvantages of the models identified in #2 for the intended use of postmarketing surveillance as envisioned by the Sentinel Initiative.  Evaluate issues related to policy, performance, privacy and security, robustness of findings, benefits to all stakeholders, and data standards.

<DESC>Introduction<br/><br/>
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), has a requirement for development of clinical proteomic biomarkers, resources and reagents that will enable clinical researchers to exploit the potential of applied proteomics to advance research related to clinically important fundamental problems in infectious diseases and biodefense.<br/>
<br/>
Description<br/>
<br/>
DMID requires the Clinical Proteomics Centers for Infectious Diseases and Biodefense to discover, qualify, and verify candidate protein biomarkers to be made widely available to the scientific community for use as reagents for further development.  These candidate biomarkers are required to have the potential to be used clinically to improve detection and diagnosis, and to monitor therapeutic and vaccine responses and susceptibility to infection for diseases caused by NIAID Category A-C biodefense and emerging/re-emerging infectious disease pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). The Centers will be required to provide established high throughput, state-of-the-art proteomics facilities as a resource to NIAID and as a service to the broad scientific community for the conduct of clinical proteomics research projects proposed in collaboration with clinical infectious disease researchers to identify candidate protein biomarkers.   DMID requires the Centers ensure a sustained source of well-characterized human clinical samples for clinical proteomics research projects to be conducted by the Center, and obtain well-characterized human clinical samples from cases and controls necessary to conduct clinical proteomics research projects.  It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about 8/1/2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: 10.45 FTEs.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about August 2, 2007. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

<DESC><p>***** NOTICE: ***** This notice amends the previously-issued Presolicitation Notice to advise potential offerors of the magnitude of this construction project. The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.</p>
<p>Previously posted Presolicitation Notice with changes annotated by asterisk:</p>
<p>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District will issue a Request for Proposal for the construction of Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) consisting of a 144-person barracks facility at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. ***** The magnitude of this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.***** The solicitation will be available for download on or about November 15, 2008. The closing date for receipt of proposals is January 15, 2009 (unless changed by an official amendment to the solicitation). The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competitive procedures. The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors cited in this announcement and the solicitation. Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed price. NAICS Code: 236220 with a current size standard of $33,500,000. The Federal Supply Code is Y163. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is contingent upon funding and Congressional approval. Should Congress not authorize this project or appropriate the funds, the solicitation will be canceled. If the project is canceled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror. If a large business is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirements for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The FY08 subcontracting goals for this contract are a minimum of 70.0% of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 6.2% of that to small disadvantaged businesses, 7.0% to woman-owned small businesses, 9.8% to HUBzone small businesses, and 3.0% to veteran-owned small business, and 0.9% to service disabled veteran-owned small business. The Davis-Bacon Act will apply. All responders are advised that this project may be canceled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. All contractors are advised that they must be registered in CCR and ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov). Joint ventures must also be registered in CCR and ORCA as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure registration is in place should they be selected for the award. "Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award." (Reference DFAR 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration). PROJECT INFORMATION: The project includes connection to an energy monitoring and control system (EMCS), building information system and anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) measures such as structural reinforcements, setbacks, and reinforced (laminated) glass. Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service, exterior light; fire protection and alarm systems; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; parking; erosion control and storm drainage; site grading and contouring; information systems; site improvements; and power distribution extension service. Access for individuals with disabilities will be provided in public areas. Comprehensive building and furnishings interior design services are required. This acquisition is a 1-Phase solicitation where performance capability and price are evaluated in a single phase. SELECTION CRITERIA: Award will be based on the Best Value approach. Offerors will be evaluated based upon the following non-price evaluation factor: Performance Capability to include: specialized experience; past performance; proposed contract duration and summary schedule; key personnel capabilities and experience; small business utilization; and Price. The Subcontracting Plan required for Large Businesses will be evaluated on a Go/No Go basis. The overall non-price evaluation rating is considered more important than price. OBTAINING THE SOLICITATION: The solicitation for this project will be available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY and will be available for download on or about November 15, 2008. All solicitation documents will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fbo.gov.
