<ARCHDATE>01062005
<CONTACT>Richard P.  Bolick Contract Specialist 7037871395     richard.bolick@mms.gov;
<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR).  The MMS web site has descriptions of OSRR activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects.  The web site address is www.mms.gov/tarphome.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.  BACKGROUND: Oil Spill Response Research sponsored by the Minerals Management Service through the Technology Research and Assessment Program is directly integrated into MMS's offshore operations and is used in making regulatory decisions pertaining to permit and plan approvals, safety and pollution inspections, enforcement actions, and training requirements.  MMS proposes to expand its existing OSRR program consistent with our statutory responsibility and the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  As oil and gas industry activities increase in the deep water of Gulf of Mexico and the and ice-infested Beaufort Sea of Alaska, research must be broadened to address unknown factors concerning mechanical equipment performance and reliability as well as alternative countermeasures, including chemical dispersants, in situ burning and viscous oil pumping.  The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among several general topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested. Projects selected for eventual funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2004 funds. The MMS anticipates a total of $300,000 to $500,000 may be available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSRR topics in FY 2004 with projects being identified through this announcement and additional avenues. Typical projects envisioned to address the topics set forth below may require one quarter to one man-year effort, and prospective offerors shall bear this in mind when responding to this request.  OBJECTIVES: The proposed objectives for the FY 2004 OSRR activities include, but are not limited to, research related to the following:  1) Innovative Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for the Open Ocean - The MMS is seeking new technologies that will facilitate the containment and recovery of spilled oil (both light and high density) in the open ocean.  A subject of particular interest is response techniques and equipment for removing heavy oils (crude oil as well as fuel oil) and emulsions from the sea surface.  MMS seeks opportunities to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototypes and non-commercially available technologies at Ohmsett - the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey.  American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. 2) Innovative Oil Spill Containment and Recovery Technologies for Broken Ice Conditions - Increased offshore and onshore development is planned for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska.  Effective cleanup of oil spills in broken ice conditions is still a considerable challenge.  MMS is seeking new technologies that will facilitate the containment and recovery of spilled oil (both light and heavy) in broken ice.   MMS seeks opportunities to performance test and evaluate full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain and recover oil in a range of broken ice conditions.  Focus should be on the types of broken ice typically found in the nearshore areas of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea, where oil exploration activities are currently taking place or are planned.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett; ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.  3) Technology for the Separation of Oil and Ice - New and/or innovative technologies that will facilitate the separation of oil, ice and water when responding to oil spills in ice-infested waters.  MMS seeks opportunities to performance test and evaluate new or innovative technologies for the separation of oil, ice and water related to oil spill response in ice-infested waters.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett; ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations.   4) Technology for the Recovery and Pumping of High Density and Viscous Oils - New or innovative technologies that will facilitate the recovery and pumping of heavy and viscous oils.  Recent spill events in the U.S and Europe have raised the awareness of the limitations of present-day mechanical recovery equipment in removing heavy oils and emulsions from the sea surface, their subsequent temporary storage and transfer operations.  MMS seeks opportunities that will address improvements in the state of the art for this equipment and to performance test and evaluate these full-scale prototype, non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to recover and pump heavy and viscous oils.  Tests could be conducted at Ohmsett; ASTM testing standards will be used, as applicable, in these evaluations. White Papers are also requested to address the need for a high density, viscous oil, standardized testing methodology, which does not presently exist. The methodology could contain quantitative and qualitative components. 5)  Detection and Tracking of Spilled Oil on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) - Increased offshore exploration, development and production is planned for deepwater (5,000 feet and greater) in Gulf of Mexico and for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska.  MMS is seeking new and innovative technology, equipment and methods for the remote sensing and surveillance of spilled oil on the OCS.  This equipment must be able to locate and accurately map the location of the spilled oil and be able to fax a geo-referenced map of the slick to responders while airborne.  6)  Detection and Tracking of Spilled Oil Under Ice - MMS is seeking new and innovative equipment and technologies for the remote sensing and surveillance of oil in and under ice.  This equipment shall be able to locate and accurately map the location of the oil.  MMS seeks opportunities to test and evaluate these technologies through a series of field tests conducted in Arctic environments. 7)  Chemical Dispersant Research - White Papers are requested that will serve to facilitate the intelligent use of dispersants in U.S. OCS waters. Of particular interest is the use of methods to assess dispersant effectiveness realistically, as a function of several factors including dispersant type, oil type and weathered state, dispersant-to-oil ratio, spill characteristics, sea state, and environmental conditions. Also of interest are concepts for the use of dispersants in response to deep-water blowouts and on viscous oil spills, improved methods for applying dispersants, and monitoring their effectiveness in the field.  8) Testing Novel Oil Spill Dispersant Delivery Methods and Systems at Ohmsett - The National Oil Spill Response Test Facility - Chemical dispersants have traditionally been applied to oil spills either via aircraft or outrigger spray boom mounted on vessels.  One of the major drawbacks of vessel-based application has been the cumbersome support arms used to mount multiple spray nozzles out from the vessels sides to achieve a reasonable spray swath.  The small discharge nozzles used in these systems are also prone to blockage and require on-going maintenance to ensure proper operation in emergency situations.  MMS is seeking White Papers that address improved methods for the delivery of dispersants by vessels.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to oil spill response, safety and pollution practices related to offshore operations. As a result of the White Papers, selected proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should be to the above stated issues and/or other issues related to the offshore operations. Multi-year funding of projects is acceptable.  HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers, not more than five (5) pages in length, an original, five (5) hard copies and one (1) electronic copy in pdf format on CD or standard 3 ½ inch diskette shall be submitted to U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE, 381 ELDEN STREET, HERNDON, VIRGINIA 20170-4817, not later 3:00 PM, EST FEBRUARY 18, 2004.

The anticipated sole source acquisition is to General Atomics of San Diego California.  The contract will be CPFF and approximately $200,000 for a period of one year with four one-year options (total of five years).  This work is a continuation of work prior performed under a DOE contract with the DOE Oakland Operations Office.

GA will provide the fuel compacts to the EU and assist in the preparation of specifications for the irradiation.  The irradiation tests will take place at the EU?s High Flux Reactor in Petten, Netherlands.  The EU will provide the capsule for the irradiation examination, and the disposal of the test samples.  GA will supply the compacts, assist in the preparation of the specifications for the irradiation and post-irradiation examination (PIE), follow the progress of the irradiation and PIE, and prepare a final report on the compact irradiation.  The exception to competition is 10 US.C 2304(c)(1) ? only one responsible source and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is not a notice of availability of a solicitation ? there is no RFP available.  Only sources believing they have the requisite capability may respond with a capability statement.  Any statements received will be reviewed only to determine if the basis for a sole source procurement no longer exists and the acquisition should then proceed on a competitive basis.

DTRS56 04 BAA 0002, due February 20, 2004, POC Warren D. Osterberg, Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-366-6942, Fax 202-366-7974, Email: warren.osterberg@rspa.dot.gov 

CONTACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information on cost-shared activities that offer practical solutions to improve the safety and integrity of the Nations pipeline infrastructure.  Interested parties must submit separate white papers for each proposed project.  Multiple projects are not to be combined into a single white paper.  Each white paper must not exceed five pages and must include a description of the state-of-the-art in the area being proposed, actions proposed to advance that state with a quantifiable method to measure the improvement anticipated upon completion of the project.  In addition, each white paper must include the offerors contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address.  

On April 23 and April 25, 2002, RSPAs Office of Pipeline Safety (RSPA/OPS) held two (2) briefings to provide additional information on the BAA process.  Interested parties may obtain more details on these briefings via the Pipeline Safety Research and Development (R&D) Internet Web site http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  The Internet Web site contains the presentation from the briefings, questions and answers from the briefings, and a list of potential bidders and others who requested that their contact information be made public.  

On December 11-12, 2003, the RSPA Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) co-hosted a Research and Development (R&D) Forum on the Role of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 in the development of Energy Pipeline Technology.  The meeting objective was to identify impacts, opportunities, and needs arising from R&D provisions of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (PSIA) based on the perspective of relevant government agencies, industry, and pipeline R&D funding organizations. The meeting outcome identified current research efforts, key challenges facing government and industry, plus potential research that can help to meet these challenges. To obtain the downloadable report listing identified challenges and research needs visit: http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_121103.htm.

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open through February 20, 2004, unless otherwise amended.  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit research projects to assure the long-term integrity and security of the nations gas and hazardous liquid pipeline network.  A team of experts will review the white papers submitted in response to this announcement and offerors will be advised of the outcome and anticipated follow-up from this review as it is completed.

SCOPE:  In November 2001, a RSPA/OPS Research & Development workshop brought together government agencies (Federal, State, local and international), research institutions, pipeline companies and their associations, standards organizations, and public representatives to begin development of a national pipeline safety research agenda.  The workshop description, speaker notes, and other documents of interest are on the Pipeline Safety R&D Internet Web site: http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  On March 28, 2002, RSPA set out on the path by issuing the first of three BAAs to solicit white papers for Damage Prevention and Leak Detection research and development.  This resulted in RSPA awarding $1.6 million for seven research agreements.  On June 5, 2002, RSPA issued a second BAA to solicit white papers for Enhanced Pipeline Operations, Controls, and Monitoring and awarded $1.18 million for six research agreements as a result.  On December 30, 2002, RSPA completed the first cycle of the process by issuing the third and final BAA requesting white papers for Improved Materials Performance and Other Pipeline Safety Improvements. This resulted in RSPA awarding $1.92 million for eight research agreements related to this BAA. Additional information on these agreements can be found on the Pipeline Safety R&D Internet Web site referenced above.

On December 17, 2002, the President signed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (PSIA 2002).  This act identified ten focus areas that Congress and the Administration felt were critical to an effective pipeline safety and integrity R&D Program.  The PSIA 2002 also identified RSPA/OPS as having lead responsibility for near-term research, development and demonstration in eight of the ten focus areas.  While RSPA/OPS had initiated R&D projects in most of the areas identified in the PSIA 2002, several areas were under-represented in project awards based on the first three BAAs.

On June 17, 2003, in preparation for the next phase of its R&D Program, RSPA/OPS conducted a meeting of its R&D Blue Ribbon Panel.  Membership of the Panel consisted of representatives of pipeline operators, trade associations and other Federal Agencies.  The Panel reviewed the progress made to date and OPSs plans for future R&D efforts.  

This BAA has been developed to incorporate the direction provided in the PSIA 2002 as well as input from the Blue Ribbon Panel.  This BAA solicits white papers for both individual R&D projects and consolidated R&D programs.  The topical areas around which this BAA has been structured include those stipulated in the PSIA 2002 and the topical areas included in the initial three BAAs that were not completely addressed by awards issued under those BAAs. A white paper developed in response to this BAA must identify the focus area of interest and describe how the proposed work supports Pipeline Safety Improvements. The topic areas of interest are: Damage Prevention; Leak Detection; Enhanced Pipeline Operations, Controls, and Monitoring; Improved Materials Performance; and Other Safety Improvements.  The area Enhanced Pipeline Operations, Controls and Monitoring includes developmental needs related to improved human factors.  The area Other Safety Improvements includes developmental needs related to Crack Detection Technologies, Pipeline Inspection Technologies and Risk Assessment methods.

OPS is seeking white papers on individual projects from independent pipeline industry members and white papers on consolidated R&D programs in support of Pipeline Safety Improvements. To support selection of organizations to manage consolidated R&D Programs, RSPA is seeking white papers to identify and qualify organizations to coordinate, conduct, and effectively manage a portfolio of interrelated R&D projects in focused areas of interest to OPS.  Program Areas being considered for Consolidated R&D programs include research, development and demonstration that will improve pipeline safety and integrity or reduce the cost of state-of-the-art pipeline safety activities.  A consolidated R&D program white paper from the team lead organization should identify opportunities for integrated R&D that could involve contributions from several organizations whose combined expertise will contribute greater efficiency and effectiveness to R&D in the proposed program areas. These white papers will be judged on both the merits of the suggested approach to managing a program area and the capability of the proposing organizations to carry out the proposed program.  

Examples of focus programs and Projects within the desired program areas include the following: 

Damage Prevention 

	Focus on the detection and prevention of excavation damage. A project could identify several technologies for preventing encroachment and detecting excavation damage, evaluate the potential of each alternative (or complementary technique), select technique(s) for further development based on the risk averted by each, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected technique(s).

Leak Detection

	Detection of small leaks  Ecological and drinking water resources can be impacted by small pipeline leaks that are not quickly detected.   Examples of projects of interest include monitoring technologies that can quickly detect the release of a small fraction of the total product being transported, leak detection equipment for very small leaks, identifying of airborne chemicals using aerial surveillance, and research that will reduce the cost of current leak detection equipment.

Enhanced Pipeline Operations, Controls, and Monitoring

	Human factors  The effectiveness of operators in performing safety and integrity-related activities is affected by diverse factors such as the level of operator fatigue and the quality of information accessible to them to guide their response.  Managing change of pipeline controller shifts, restricting duty hours to control human fatigue, and the improved interaction between operator personnel and pipeline machinery can contribute to reduction of pipeline accidents.  Research topics of interest include technologies and procedures designed to minimize operator error, research on the effects of managing pipeline controller shift change and potential solutions for minimizing those effects, human interface in incident/accident management, and other portions of the pipeline operating system.  

	Airborne chemical mapping and pipeline encroachment monitoring  Approaches using aerial surveillance with technologies for right-of way monitoring and leak detection.  Examples of projects of potential interest include the use of unmanned or other aerial vehicles to monitor pipeline conditions and small leaks; and innovative approaches to preempt third party damage to pipelines by detecting encroachment on pipelines and their rights-of-way.

	Improved directional drilling  Directional drilling can usually safely and effectively place an underground utility beneath roads, rivers, and other difficult areas but recent accidents have shown problems may occur during the process.  Examples of projects of interest include new drilling techniques that can prevent accidental damage to existing underground utilities or the utility being installed, and technologies that will detect underground utilities in the path of the directional drill.

Improved Materials Performance

	Evaluation and development of promising new pipe materials  Numerous opportunities exist to address known threats to pipeline integrity through the development of new materials.  A project in which the available materials technologies are surveyed, the potential of each known material technology is evaluated against its potential to address known threats including extreme arctic-like cold and development is pursued on the new materials judged to represent the best potential materials for future pipelines.  Technologies that might be considered would include composite materials, damage and defect resistant materials, and high grade/high strength steels capable of operation at considerable higher pressures.

	Pipe coatings - Properly applied coatings, whether applied in the factory or in the field, can be one of the most significant factors in insuring pipeline integrity.  Examples of projects of interest include test methodologies to predict long-term performance, developing decision methodologies to improve coating choices, developing field-applied coatings with the cost and performance of factory-applied coatings, and intelligent coatings that monitor their conditions.

Other Pipeline Safety Improvements

	Strengthening and validating direct assessment (DA) practices  Assessing the integrity of pipelines that cannot be assessed using In-Line Inspections (ILI) or hydro testing currently depends on direct assessment.  While many of the tools used in direct assessment have been demonstrated through long use, the demonstration of the effectiveness of the integrated DA process has not been completed for all threats and conditions in which it might be needed.  An integrating task might be proposed to advance the current state-of-the art of DA by strengthening and validating the areas, such as stress corrosion cracking DA or External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) for bare pipes, in which development and validation is not yet complete.  Examples of sub-projects of interest could include research to enhance ultrasonic technology, guided waves, and development of pigs that will fit in currently un-piggable pipelines.

	Mathematical pipeline modeling enhancements or computational pipeline modeling enhancements  Improved ILI devices are allowing more defects to be identified and more features of these defects to be revealed.  As the knowledge from ILI runs increases, the tools to support decisions on the appropriate action to take in remediation or monitoring these defects are needed.  Examples of projects of interest include better modeling of growth defects; mathematical algorithms that will improve pipeline modeling; and improved pipeline-operating data to better detect small leaks.

	(ILI) for damage or defects - A variety of "smart" pigs and other ILI technologies are needed to monitor for, detect, and measure corrosion, cracks, and other forms of damage to pipe walls. Examples might include ILI for mechanical damage or corrosion, use of "magnetic telescopes" to identify corrosion areas, use of sensing coils that wrap around pipes to map corroded surface areas, use of ultrasound or guided waves to inspect "unpiggable" pipeline, etc.

	Crack detection and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) Methods for detecting and characterizing cracks in pipelines are needed to better identify and understand the significance of cracks associated with Stress Corrosion Cracking and cracks associated with low-frequency pre-1970 ERW piping and lap welded seams.  Crack detection for pre-1970 low-frequency ERW is needed to characterize problems endemic to the welding processes practiced by certain pipe mills.  Prevention of time-dependent growth of defects to critical size and subsequent failure requires periodic non-destructive inspection and integrity evaluations.  The non-destructive inspection tools must be able to provide a reliable indication of the presence of defects within a very narrow weld zone. The defects potentially present in these pipelines include: selective seam corrosion, fatigue cracks, lack of fusion, stitch welds, cracks from hard spots, surface breaking hook cracks near the weld, and pitting corrosion.

	Design and Safety technology enhancements for LNG facilities The recent emphasis on R&D related to pipeline integrity has largely excluded LNG facilities.  Recent increases in demand and anticipated future increases in demand for LNG seem to justify renewed emphasis in LNG-related R&D. Examples of proposed R&D activities might include non-destructive inspection tools able to reliably indicate very small leaks, material defects, internal corrosion or faulty operation of automatic control systems.  Other examples might include development and application of analytical models to characterize accident consequences from a spectrum of fire scenarios.

WHITE PAPERS: RSPA is soliciting white papers on individual projects as well as consolidated R&D programs in support of pipeline safety improvements.  Each proposal must include a cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed projects cost in order to be considered.  Each white paper must not exceed five pages including appendices and backup materials, include contact information previously described, and include sufficient information to evaluate the following areas:

<DESC>National Institutes of Health, (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis (LEC), plans to procure on a sole source basis services from the National Oncology Center of Hungary, 1122 Budapest Rath Gy. U. 7/9, Hungary, for the Evaluation of Treatment Protocols for Liver Cancer by Global Gene Expression Analysis.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent visceral neoplasms worldwide, with 564,000 estimated new cases and almost as many deaths for the year 2000.  The main etiologic agents of HCC are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), which together are responsible for about 80% of all HCCs in humans and account for much of the striking variation in the incidence of HCC in human populations residing in different geographic areas.  HCC is also one of the most deadly human cancers with a median survival after diagnosis of less than one year.  Establishing new and improving existing treatment protocols are therefore of critical importance. Contractor Requirements: Contractor in collaboration with NCI are to provide clinical information and tissue samples from HCC patients in Hungary.  Contractor in collaboration with NCI, shall use the global gene expression technique to both characterize the primary tumor at the time of diagnosis and to follow the prognosis of the patients subjected to different treatment protocols.   The overall goal is to establish a database that will be used to optimize treatment based on both the characteristics of the primary tumor and response to treatment.   Period of Performance: Base Year; upon award through twelve (12) months with two (2) twelve (12) month option year periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" (11/99) and 52.217-9 "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract" (3/00) apply.  The National Oncology Center of Hungary is the only known source that has been approved by the NIH, Office of Internal Affairs that can provide the services required.  The services provided by the contractor will be for the direct benefit and use of the Federal Government in that the results of this research will aid our understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma for which Hungary offers unique clinical and etiological opportunities.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, January 23,  2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with Counterparts, Inc., Cabin John, MD  20818.  The purpose of this procurement is to support the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) and the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office on Disability in synthesizing the results of the HHSs international efforts on developing systems of care for children with special health care needs (CSHCN) to support its work on the New Freedom Initiative.  Counterparts planned the first International Congress on Serving Children with Disabilities in the Community in 1992-1994, 1996 and 1998.  Counterparts has served as the liaison with the Canadian Government and its national family advocacy organization in panning the first of these Childrens Congresses to be hold outside the U.S. in October, 2000.  Most of all, through its work on the first seven International Congresses, its principles have developed an extensive database on pediatric providers, service systems, and program initiatives in a variety of countries.  Counterparts serve as an archive for all the documents from prior congresses.  The material that Counterparts has is not available in their entirety anywhere else.  Any other organization would have to replicate the database before they could start work.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.   Therefore, Counterparts is the only responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  This requirement will be awarded under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated period of performance is for a twelve (12) month period.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  This announcement is for information only.  NO solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>020604
<ARCHDATE>01062005
<CONTACT>Melissa McPherson Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.McPherson@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This announcement is in response to the original Request for Information.  This Project is will no longer be a Small Business Set-Aside.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  This is a continuation of a series of previous monitoring efforts developing a long-term database related to the environmental health of the East and West Flower Garden Banks.  This study is important for validating the decision to relax the lease-stipulated requirement on the offshore industry to monitor exploratory or development and production activities within the 1-mile zone of the banks.  Oil and gas activity in the area has continually increased in recent years.  The East and West Flower Garden Banks have received an increasing variety of protective special area designations including Habitat Area of Particular Concern (HAPC) for Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) by National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and Special Ocean Site (SOS) by the Environmental Protection Agency.  This effort will continue the long-term monitoring at the East and West Flower Garden Banks to detect any subtle, chronic effects from natural and man-induced activities that could potentially endanger community integrity.  The monitoring will be consistent with past MMS topographic features monitoring, as well as the previously required lease stipulation monitoring for activities located within the 1-mile zone of the Flower Garden Banks.  Techniques are similar to most all other coral reefs monitoring studies.  Observations shall be made to evaluate coral colonies, accretionary growth, and general community health.  Continuously recording water quality instrumentation was added to the ongoing study in 2001.  These instruments will be maintained and data analyzed for a variety of water quality parameters.  Ongoing monitoring at the Flower Garden Banks is important to validate and to sustain our contention that the lease stipulations provide effective mitigation of impacts to the offshore environment and particularly, these sensitive and unique biological features.  Continuation of the proposed study is important to validate the decision to relax the lease-stipulated requirement on the offshore industry to monitor exploratory or development and production activities within the 1-mile zone of these topographic features.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firms submitting a proposal must register in the GSA ITSS system prior to closing date for receipt of proposals.   Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Fl is equipping its new Air Traffic Control Tower. This requirement was originally solicited under another solicitation number and cancelled.  Two proposals were received under the cancelled solicitation.  (Previous price quotations received under the cancelled RFP ranged from $260,000 to $279,000).  The tower requires a fully integrated Voice Communications System for Air Traffic Control. This system will provide control of air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communications to include access to radios and public and private telephone networks. This work should meet technical standards set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control tower radios and communication systems.  The system should have superior voice quality and non-blocking access to all audio channels. A touch screen control panel is preferred. Four workstations are required. Three workstations will be located in the tower cab in console locations designated by KSC. One workstation will be installed in the Landing Aids Control Building (LACB). LACB is located approximately 2 miles from the tower. Eight air to ground radio systems are required for the tower. Three radios will be GFE.  Successful offeror will procure additional radios as described below and install all eight systems at the tower location. The work to be performed includes installation of 3 workstations in the Air Traffic Control Tower cab, installation of 5 VHF radio systems in the Tower. Radios must be compatible with current KSC installed VHF radios, installation of 3 UHF radio systems in the Tower.

Facility shall be available from 7am to 3:30pm local time. All contactor employees must obtain KSC badge.  Delivery and installation should be within 90 days of order placement. 
2.  The Government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  FAR 52.212-2 titled Evaluation-Commercial Items shall apply.  Technical merit is more important than price.  However, when technical differences become less significant, price will become increasingly more important.   Total proposed price will be evaluated.  Prices that are excessively high or low may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable, may receive no further consideration.  The Government will evaluate technical proposals based on the factors of past experience and technical approach with past experience being slightly more important than technical approach.  Past experience will be evaluated according to the extent to which the offerors documented past experience is similar to the nature, complexity, and scope of work described in the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate each offerors technical approach for completeness, the extent to which it demonstrates that it will meet requirements in an effective manner, and qualifications of those assigned (if applicable) to carry out the technical approach being offered.    The offeror shall describe its approach for meeting the requirements of the SOW and how it plans to conduct the work.  To support the past experience evaluation, please list the dollar value of similar project, timeframe completed, brief description of your firms role in project, etc.  Technical proposals should be limited to no more than 10 pages.  The clause at FAR 52.212-4,Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition 11. The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation N00174-04-R-00___  is being issued as a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 18.  THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The NAICS code is 334517 and the size standard is 500.  The offeror shall provide one firm fixed price F.O.B. Destination for this requirement.  Due to the urgency of this requirement and its impact on other programs, the offeror shall propose an expeditious and reasonable delivery period to which the contractor can be contra ctually bound.  The government requires delivery of the system by no later than 15 March 2004 and training to commence no later than 24 March 2004. NSWC Indian Head is conducting an urgent procurement for a digital x-ray system for the evaluation of various five-inch diameter rocket motors.  This system includes; cabinetry of a specific size and compliant with 21CFR1020.40, a Varian 4030, high voltage, premium DR plate with workstation and software, and a complete x-ray source (to include tube-head, generators, cooler and controller).  The vendor is to obtain assemble and test this system at their location, disassemble the system and ship F.O.B. Destination to NSWC Indian Head. The system will be reassembled by Indian Head personnel and must comply with the above CFR.  21CFR1020.40 guides the design, fabrication and assembly of this system.  Cabinetry - This is a component  system in which a shuttered tube cabinet (this shuttered cabinet is currently under construction and to be provided to the awardee as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) within 4 weeks after award of this contract) is placed on top of a center cabinet to which are attached to two end cabinets.  Both the center and end cabinets have an internal frame of 2 inch x 1/4 inch square tubing.  This framework will hold the material handling tracks, etc..  Thus, the threshold of the openings in the sides of both the end cabinets and the center cabinet must lie flush with this framework.  The contractor shall be responsible for integrating and certifying the entire system to include GFE in compliance with 21CFR1020.40.  Each cabinet must be movable via a forklift.  The center cabinet does not have to support the tube cabinet.  Sketch of the assembled cabinets will be e-mail upon request. The center cabinet shall meet the following specifications: &#61623; Outside dimensions of cabinet (LWH) which will be approximately  32 inches x 34 inches x 48 inches. The height will vary to achieve the source to detector distance as specified below. The hinged door is on a 32 inch face. &#61623; 420 keV (3800 Rad @1m) will enter the cabinet through the top.  Thus, the base is a primary barrier and the four sides are each a secondary barrier. &#61623; NO leakage through the solid parts of the cabinet shall exceed 0.5mR/hr (21 CFR 1020.40 compliant) &#61623; Basically a box, the base of which is the primary barrier (sketch to be provided upon request)  &#61623; Supported at the corners by 3 inch square table legs (not being procured under this contract). &#61623; Provision to move the box with a fork lift is required &#61623; All openings are 18 inches square.   Opening in top may be reduced to accommodate collimator. &#61623; Internal frame of 2 inch x 1/4 inch sq. tube   &#61623; NO fasteners through the lead (Pb) of the external wall.  Bolts are used to attach the end cabinet to the center cabinet. &#61623; One latchable door (with interlocks) on front of cabinet as shown above. &#61623; The opening in the top is centered therein, and collimated to produce an 18 inch square image size on the primary barrier. &#61623; The surface of the digital detector is 5 inches above the surface of the primary barrier.  The height of the cabinet MUST be adjusted to produce an 48 inch source to detector distance.  (Source is 6 inches above the top of this cabinet.) &#61623; The height from the inside (from the top of the base to the bottom (threshold) of the three openings in the sides and front) is 2 inches.  Thus the 2 inch sq. tube frame  is flush with the bottom of the openings in the sides and front of the cabinet. The end cabinets shall meet the following specifications: &#61623; The units shall be identical with doors fixtured in mirrored configuration &#61623; Each cabinet shall be 96 inches long by 30 inches wide by 30 inches deep &#61623; Lead (Pb) thickness shall be 0.75 inches or that sufficient to comply with 21 CFR 1020.40 &#61623; The internal frame shall be completed of 2 inch x 1/4 inch square tubing &#61623; An 18 inch square opening in the center of the top, covered by a bolt-on door &#61623; An 18 inch square opening in both ends, centered side to side, with its threshold flush with the internal frame &#61623; One end of the cabinet will attach to the center cabinet.  An automatic track mount door will cover the other end &#61623; An automated door assembly including the door, rails , stepper motor, and interlocks must be mounted to this other end of the cabinet. Source - This system will be used in an industrial production application.  The system is expected to operate an average of 12 hours a day.  This system is expected to examine a very broad range of munitions.  Thus, the tube output will be adjusted several times, though not more than five, a shift.  The range of these adjustments will be from 100 keV through 420 keV with the mA kept fairly close to the maximum allowable.  The contractor shall provide a standard control console which operates in parallel with the PC user interface. The contractor shall supply a Comet MXR-420/25 x-ray tube. The contractor shall also provide a description of the electrical services (e.g., a dedicated 30 AMP 220 Volt circuit) required by the system. Digital Detector - Ease of operation is a priority.  The di gital detector must meet the following specifications: &#61623; Tolerate 3800R/hr for a 12 hour workday (420 keV at max mA) &#61623; Detector will be a Varian  premium grade High Voltage 4030 DR plate &#61623; Provide a PC, monitor, and software (Varian basic software is sufficient) that allows the operator to perform pass/fail decisions in real time The offeror shall provide a one-year parts and labor guarantee.  The government assumes the responsibility to provide the appropriate preventative maintenance.  The contractor shall provide one person to NSWC Indian Head for initial start-up and training.  This will not be for more than 3 days during which performance is demonstrated and assistance is offered in technique development. The government will provide test media  to be utilized during training.  During training, the trainer shall review the preventative main tenance requirements of the system. The system is to be delivered to NSWC Indian Head F.O.B. Destination with all of the OEM documentation and software, including preventative maintenance requirements. The government requires delivery of the system by no later than 15 March 2004 and training to commence no later than 24 March 2004. The following provisions apply: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial, 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (FAR clauses 52.219-6, 52.219-8, 52.222-3, 52.222.19, 52.222-21, 52.222-36, 52.225-13, and 52.232-33 also apply).   52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items: The evaluation factors are as follows listed in descending order of importance, unless otherwise stated: Factor 1: Proposed Delivery Schedul e.

<DESC>E-PLAN ENHANCEMENTS FOR HOMELAND SECURITY

BACKGROUND

On September 24, 2002, the EPA Assistant Administrator for Research and Development established the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC or Center) in order to support the Agencys vital role in homeland security.  Specifically, the Center was created to manage and coordinate in the Office of Research and Development all homeland security research and technical assistance efforts, particularly in the areas of building safety, water security and rapid risk assessment.  The two primary goals of this Center are:
	Conduct and facilitate the conduct of needed research and development methods or approaches to limit vulnerabilities in the nations water and building systems following purposeful introduction of hazardous agents.
	Provide information, tools and support to the EPA regions and emergency response personnel to aid in the preparation for and response to a terrorist attack.

In support of these goals, the Center is searching for a means of sharing highly technical, risk-based information with emergency responders in support of their efforts in (1) prevention, (2) emergency preparedness, and (3) emergency response.  


SCOPE

The Center is interested in developing/supporting an electronic based system to assist emergency responders in preparing for emergency situations in buildings and water systems.  This system would be used to identify and assist in remediation of building and water system vulnerabilities. In addition, this tool will be able to provide basic information that will help protect first responders and occupants of these areas in the event of a terrorist action in which chemicals and biologicals are used.  As this tool evolves, additional information will be added to assist EPAs on-scene coordinators and the emergency response team in responding to questions concerning evacuation and decontamination.  The goal is that the system will eventually include an expert system that can assist these emergency responders in generating a back-of-the-envelope risk calculation and can provide information to assist risk managers in deciding upon the appropriate means of clean-up.    


TASKS

Task 1.0 Develop a Project Plan for the Complete Risk Tool

The contractor will submit a technical plan for developing an electronic system that will provide emergency responders with tools that will: (1) assist in conducting vulnerability assessments and (2) provide risk-based information up to and including an expert system the will generate the back-of-the-envelope risk calculation.  The contractor shall indicate how this can be done using E-plan as a backbone for the system wherever it is technically feasible.   

Deliverables: A draft plan will be delivered to the Project Officer.  The information in the plan shall be presented in phases, clearly outlining what each phase shall do, its value to the emergency response community, and the cost of each phase.  

Acceptance Criteria: The draft shall be well-organized, technically accurate, clear and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task.  


Task 2.0 Develop Tools For Vulnerability Assessments

As a first step in developing vulnerability assessments, the contractor shall develop an easy to use floor plan mapping tool.  This tool shall allow persons conducting an assessment to electronically draw the plan of each floor of the facility and drag and click icons that shall identify the position of equipment/materials important to emergency responders (e.g., chemical storerooms, gas cut-off valves, HVAC system controls, etc.).  This tool should also include a means to provide easy access to basic instructions concerning the operation of key systems (e.g., how to shut off the HVAC system).  These tools should be adaptable to conducting vulnerability assessments of  water systems.

Deliverables:  A prototype with written descriptions of the drawing tool for buildings woment of Work is posted as Amendment 2 to this Fedbizopps announcement. 

Capability statements shall not exceed 5 pages and standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Reference RFQ-OH-04-00018. Again, this statement is for information purposes only. 

Interested parties shall submit their capabilities to the Contract Specialist no later than 15 days after the date of this announcement (by 5:00 PM Monday, January 22, 2004).

Texas A&M performed initial development work on this product and the current E-Plan based platform was developed by the University of Texas at Dallas. The system will be modified to identify and assist in remediation of building and water vulnerabilities. E-Plan provides basic information that is helpful in protecting first responders and occupants of buildings and areas surrounding water systems in the event of a terrorist action in which chemicals and biologicals are used.  As part of the developments of this system under the anticipated purchase order, additional information and data will be inputted to further assist EPA personnel in responding to questions concerning evacuation and decontamination. For further information on E-plan, see: http://eplannews.utdallas.edu/eplan-advantage.htm and/or
http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/alps/Proj_Desc/Eplan.pdf  

NHSRC wants to enhance the current E-Plan tool to include an "expert system" that can assist  emergency responders in generating a "back-of-the-envelope" risk calculation and provide information to assist risk managers in deciding upon the appropriate means of clean-up. The contractor shall develop a technical plan which will outline how E-Plan could be enhanced to provide emergency responders with tools that will: (1) assist in conducting vulnerability assessments, and (2) provide risk-based information up to and including an expert system that will generate back-of-the-envelope risk calculations.   

The contractor shall enhance E-Plan by developing an easy to use floor plan mapping tool.  This tool would allow persons conducting an assessment to electronically "draw" the plan of each floor of the facility with standard "drag and click" icons that will identify the position of equipment/materials important to emergency responders (e.g., chemical storerooms, gas cut-off valves, HVAC system controls, etc.).  This tool shall also include a means to provide easy access to basic instructions concerning the operation of key systems (e.g., how to shut off the HVAC system).  These tools shall be adaptable to conducting vulnerability assessments of  water systems.

The contractor shall provide training in the use of the enhanced E-Plan tool to Agency personnel as well as first responders identified by the Agency.  The contractor shall develop written training materials, and provide at least two training sessions.

The contractor must have an in-depth knowledge of the requirements of emergency response personnel in order to be able to understand and make the needed software enhancements in a user-friendly manner.

Interested parties shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their experience in: 1.) modification of web based software developed by another party, 2.) designing software tools for emergency response personnel, and a knowledge of the type of information that is required by such personnel. 

The Stateuld be provided electronically to the Project Officer.  The prototype shall be tested by EPA personnel and first responders identified by EPA and revisions based on these tests shall be completed within 3 months of delivery to the Project Officer. 

Acceptance Criteria: The prototypes shall be technically accurate, clear, and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task. All software developed and system documentation shall be reviewed and evaluated against Agency guidelines and standards.

 
Task 3.0 Provide Training in the Use of Vulnerability Assessment Tools
   
In order to test the prototype, the contractor shall provide training in the use of this tool to Agency personnel as well as first responders identified by the Agency.  The contractor shall develop written training materials and shall provide 2 training sessions at a site specified by the EPA Project Officer.  This will require travel for a maximum of 2 contractor staff on 2 trips, to Cincinnati, Ohio and/or Washington, DC.  

Deliverables:  Written training materials that provide user friendly instructions and exercises on using the drawing tool.  In addition, the contractor shall conduct 2 half-day training sessions. 

Acceptance Criteria: The training materials and sessions shall be well-organized, technically accurate, clear and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task.


Task 4.0 Incorporate Cincinnati Data Into the E-Plan System

Under a Memorandum of Agreement between the EPA and the City of Cincinnati Fire Department (hereafter, the City or Cincinnati), the City shall serve as a beta tester for products that are being developed by the NHSRC.  The contractor shall work with EPA and the City to ensure that data from Cincinnati buildings, be they private or public, can be easily submitted electronically and incorporated into E-Plan.  The contractor shall work with EPA and the City to provide any necessary training in the use of the forms and the E-Plan system in general.  As the predecessor contractor has done this roll-out in several cities already, many of the basic materials necessary to include a new city have already been developed, and only need modification for use in Cincinnati.  

Deliverables: The contractor shall develop an electronic submission form specifically for use in Cincinnati.  The contractor shall input whatever data are provided by the City into the E-plan system.  Finally, the contractor shall provide 2-3 training sessions on the use of E-Plan and/or the use of the electronic data submission forms. 

Acceptance criteria: The electronic submission form and any training provided by the contractor shall be well-organized, technically accurate, clear, and complete, and meet specific requirements of this task.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to publish the Questions received from Industry, with the Governments response. 

	Q1. The required development schedule for the Breadboard and 
 Prototype systems does not provide enough time to order, receive, 
 integrate and test the required subsystems, consistent with an 
 acceptable level of risk.

 	A1. Schedule is important.  Bidders should do their best to address 
 the Government's schedule desires within acceptable levels of risk and 
 consistent with funding realities and the phased Government decision
 process identified in the PRDA.   

 	Q2. In connection with Q1, the most rapid Breadboard and Prototype 
 implementation times would be achieved if certain long-lead items 
 could be placed on order during the initial Critical Design Review 
 phase; however, the planned budget for the initial phase does not support this.

 	A2. That is correct.  As a general rule, hardware procurement of 
 end-item components is not considered prudent prior to CDR.  
 Furthermore, for SYCO Phase 2, the Government is particularly 
 reluctant to authorize such procurement, because of the GO/NO-GO and 
 Breadboard vs. Prototype decisions that the Government must make at 
 CDR.  However the Government is willing to consider authorization and 
 funding of long-lead item procurement during the pre-CDR phase on a 
 case-by-case basis, if it can be shown to be vital and prudent, and will not compromise the
 subsequent CDR decision processes.    

 	Q3. We feel that maintaining acceptable levels of risk in meeting the 
 technical goals requires a level of risk mitigation activity in the 
 initial program phase beyond the amount that can be funded with the 
 $3.5 million funding ceiling. In addition, the funding level does not 
 encourage teaming to facilitate "best-in-class" solutions as presented 
 in the Industry Day briefing.

A. 3.  The Government recognizes that the desired $3.5M pre-CDR funding level needs to be weighed against program technical risk.  As a result, the Government has revisited the $3.5 million ceiling delineated in the announcement.  The $3.5 million for this phase is no longer a ceiling, but an estimate.  Offerors are neither expected nor encouraged to attempt to make their proposals precisely fit the Government's estimate.  Cost proposals should represent the Offerors best response to the solicitation.


Q.4.  In the SYCO Proposal Information Pamphlet (PIP), under the Evaluation Criteria paragraph 1 (page 15), the paragraph mentions the Preliminary Design Document (PDD), which is to be submitted along with the proposal. Questions are as follows:  1. Are all bidders required to submit a PDD or is it only a requirement for contractors who participated in Phase 1 of the SYCO program? 2. Will bidders who do not provide PDD's be at a disadvantage during the evaluation process? 3. If PDD's are required for all bidders, what is the required format/content?

A.4. A PDD, nor Program Background is needed for submission.  A correction to the PRDA reflecting this was posted on 5 JAN 2004.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Sources Sought synopsis to identify possible potential sources and submission of capability statements to address the increasing need of a 24-hour access to way-finding materials and hospital information for the National Institutes of Health within the Clinical Center. This is not a request for proposals or quotes and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code is 519190. A user-friendly, touch-screen kiosk would provide communication with patients, visitors, employees, and comfortable transition to the near completion of the CRC expansion area of the facility.  In addition to printable maps with paths and directions for the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health Campus, the kiosks would provide access to the Clinical Center website, general hospital information, and cafeteria services.  Users would find listings of activities, events, meetings, conferences, and training classes taking place at the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health as well as links to Institute, protocol, or physician specific information.  Transportation services (shuttles, taxis, Metro, etc.) and local area information (hotels restaurants, entertainment) would also be available via the kiosk.  Additionally, users would be able to complete the Clinical Center customer survey and access virtual programs as they become available.  Seven kiosks would be placed in heavily trafficked lobby areas in the Clinical Center and the CRC.  Three kiosks would be constructed and operational in the Clinical Center by early 2004.  The remaining four would be installed in the new CRC in coordination with facility completion and activation dates.
The proposed project consists of four phases with distinct product deliverables.  The project vendor would complete a facility survey, in coordination with pertinent completion and activation dates for the CRC.  The planning, design, production, and deployment of the kiosks are done by the vendor.  In addition, the vendor is responsible for deployment and training as well as operational and maintenance support. Submission of capability statements by those offerors based on the functional requirements as follows: 1) Each kiosk is expected to be user-intuitive, multilingual, and ADA compliant.  2) The kiosks must have a print function for way-finding materials and hospital information.  3) The system would be built with web-based software that can integrate with other software, websites and internet services. 4) The software shall be easy to update, and it shall have the capacity for adding additional components over time.  5) Furthermore, the software will be accessible through a variety of end user devices, including web browser stations, wireless tablets and PDAs kiosks, and personal computers.  The purpose of the survey is to improve the understanding of the Governments requirement and industry capabilities and allow the Government to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices.  Information provided by any vendor in response to this sources sought shall not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the vendors confidential information and will be protected under FAR Part 3.104. Those vendors desiring to submit capability statements should be received no later than January 20, 2004. Any and all proprietary and restricted information provided should be clearly marked. All vendors who submit capability statements needs to submit written materials outlining the capability and functionality of their system(s) and locations where they have them in use. All capability statements should be directed to Deborah Britton via email at dbritton@cc.nih.gov, fax at (301)594-5920, or phone (301) 594-5914.  Please ensure you have included your return email, address, mailing address, telephone number and facsimile number in the body of your response.

The Government intends to solicit only Woodward Governor and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U. S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the ability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specification along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  It is intended to award a Requirements Type Contract with one (1) Base year and Four (4) option years.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.  See Numbered Note  22.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

<DESC>This Notice is intended to Notify the Public and any Interested Parties of the Intension of Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), to Issue a Request For Proposals (RFP) in October or November 2003, for a Sole Source Contract for DYNASMART-P technical support, to be provided by the software developer, University of Maryland.  DYNASMART-P represents a new generation of tools in support of traffic operations and planning decisions in the ITS and non-ITS environments.  The model algorithms are new and complex to the user community.  Therefore, providing adequate technical support becomes essential.  Currently, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is planning to release DYNASMART-P through McTrans and to provide technical support, through UMD.  The main objectives of this project are (1) to provide training courses on DYNASMART-P, (2) to provide technical support to the FHWA and DYNASMART-P users and (3) to refine DYNASMART-P.  This will be a three-year project with one base year and two option years.  The FHWA will assess the needs for providing technical support for each option year on a yearly basis. The approximate performance period of this project will be from April  2004 through March  2007.  

The FHWA R&D initiated a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) research project to meet these data needs and to address complex traffic control and management issues in the information-based, dynamic ITS environment. Under this project, two prototypes of Traffic Estimation and Prediction System for Operations Planning (TrEPS-P) have been developed. These two prototypes (DynaMIT-P and DYNASMART-P) were developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Maryland (UMD), respectively.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the DTA project manager designated by the FHWA, completed a laboratory evaluation of both prototypes in June 2000. DYNASMART-P was recommended for further field test and public release.  Based on the recommendation, UMD completed the field test of DYNASMART-P using the planning datasets provided by the Knoxville Metropolitan Transportation Commission in August 2002.  Currently the FHWA and UMD are conducting a beta test of DYNASMART-P.  Upon completion of the beta test, DYNASMART-P will be refined and packaged for release in early 2004.  

Telephoned, E-Mailed, Faxed, Or Letter Requests for the RFP (Request for Proposals) Will Not Be Accepted.   Instead, when released, all prospective offerors are to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps at http://www.eps.gov.  Any subsequent Amendments to the RFP will Likewise be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does Not plan to mail out any Hard copies of any such Amendments. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each offeror to closely and frequently Monitor FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP which, will be absolutely Essential for all prospective offerors, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT. Please read the entire synopsis.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland Material Management Support Department (AIR 3.5) is responsible for identifying an Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) solution to address the condition, location and accurate identification of aircraft engines, engine modules and the containers used to house these assets.  AIR 3.5 is seeking eligible small business firms capable of providing an AIT solution to accurately locate and continuously determine the status, location, and historical information of high value aircraft engine assets during handling, storage and transportation.  The AIT solution shall enable more effective inventory management, reduce losses due to inventory misplacement, enable condition monitoring to reduce damage to the engine assets during shipment and storage, and offers a positive readiness improvement and a reduction in operating and support costs.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees.  The AIT solution shall be implemented in an open architecture.  A compact, low-power technology is desired with minimal infrastructure, low maintenance and easy to use programming and data entry.  Interoperability with other systems is also highly desirable. Proprietary solutions will be considered only if a government purpose license and design disclosure is made to enable the Navy to interface with other asset management systems.  The following KEY elements shall be included in the AIT solution and are listed in order of importance: 1) Total Asset Visibility  real-time locating capability for assets in-storage or in-transit is a key requirement to ensuring total asset visibility.  Position location is required to ascertain the rough geographic location of the container. The location of the container within the confines of a particular depot is highly desirable.  Proposed solutions that show that the container is within the depot but do not locate the container within the confines of a particular depot may be deemed unacceptable.  2) Item Identification  adequate memory storage for license plate data is key to ensuring the accuracy of visible items.  3) Condition  environmental sensors to monitor (at a minimum) humidity, temperature and pressure is required to ensure operational readiness of assets.  In addition to the key elements, the following characteristics are desired for the AIT solution:  1) Range  a minimum of 100 feet is required for any wireless transmission with a goal of 100 yards. 2) Operation  the beacon function should be capable of being user programmable (an emitting device cannot beacon with constant transmission and should have a capability to transmit only if queried). 3) Data Collection - user definable and at a minimum shall conform to DoD specified Unique Identification (UID) and/or Electronic Product Code (EPC) format. 4) Certifications  AIT devices shall be capable of being Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) certified. 5) Frequency  use of Radio Frequency shall be Federal Communications Commission (FCC) compliant for CONUS and must meet equivalent international standards for overseas use. 6) Part Marking Readable  easy transfer of data and communication with existing DOD AIT media such as 2-D bar codes and Contact Memory Buttons (CMB) must be integrated for data accuracy and efficiency. 7) Read/Write Capability  through use of portable methods, AIT devices shall be read/write capable while the device is affixed to a container. 8) Battery Life  a 2-year minimum life shall be achieved.  Battery must be accessible from the outside of the container to eliminate the need to open a container in order to replace a battery.  Also, a low-voltage alarm must be transmitted to report low-battery power. 9) Sensor Expandable  additional ports shall be available for future requirements.  System as a whole shall be modular and upgradeable. 10) Portable Readers  shall be commercially available and interoperable. 11) Remote Monitoring Capability  asset visibility and monitoring shall be capable of accessing over the Internet. 12) Environmental Alarms  emails shall be generated to notify responsible personnel in the event that an environmental alarm is triggered. 13) Automatic Identification System (AIS) - must establish AIS to collect the data gathered from the AIT devices on the engines/containers.  At a minimum, it is required that data be furnished in an XML like transaction or be down loadable in a generic format (CSV, TXT, MS ACCESS etc).  It is the ultimate goal that data integrate directly with the current Aircraft Engine Management System (AEMS) or equivalent future Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. 14) Container Locating  capability to pinpoint a specific AIT device is required in the form of an audible or visible medium that can be triggered in close proximity to the container.  15) Operating Temperature  AIT devices must operate in the same environmental conditions experienced by engine/module containers ( -20°F to 120°F).  Requirements will include providing products to the following locations: NAVAIR, Patuxent River, MD and Naval Air Depot (NADEP), Jacksonville, FL.  The anticipated contract type will be firm-fixed price IDIQ with a period of performance of twelve (12) months.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water distribution systems and wastewater collection system at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.  Tinker AFB occupies approximately 5,000 acres of real estate and is located 8 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  It has 771 buildings and 730 family housing units containing 15.5 million square feet of floor space. 

Electrical: Oklahoma Gas and Electric (OG&E) provides the electrical service via a combination of overhead 138kV and 69kV lines.  Tinker AFB owns and operates three of four substations on base property; OG&E owns and operates the substation transformers at the remaining station.  Power is distributed at 12,470 volts to feed distribution transformers and other miscellaneous equipment.  The distribution system is of a loop-type and is sufficient for current base operations; however, minimal capacity exists for future expansion.  There are approximately 74,000 feet of overhead circuits and approximately 162,000 feet of underground circuits. 

Natural Gas: Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) provides the natural gas at three individually-metered stations. The distribution system consists of approximately 263,000 linear feet of underground piping, the majority of which is over 50 years old.  The system has steel pipe, some with cathodic protection, and polyethylene pipe.  Gas distribution is provided at a pressure of 45 psig or lower throughout the system, with military housing being provided at 17 psig. 

Potable Water:  Tinker AFB provides its own water from 23 wells located throughout the base.  These wells have a combined pumping capacity of 5148 gpm.  Water produced is stored in five water tanks with a combined capacity of three million gallons.  Water is also available from the City of Oklahoma City at two tie-in points: a 75-psi 8-inch line and a 75-psi 10-inch line.  The distribution system is almost entirely decentralized and consists of approximately 562,000 linear feet of asbestos cement, cast iron, ductile iron, and PVC piping as well as approximately 600 fire hydrants. 

Sanitary Wastewater: The sanitary wastewater collection system consists of approximately 255,579 linear feet of clay, some lined with plastic, and PVC piping.  Manholes are both brick and concrete.  There are four lift stations integral to the collection system operation.  The sanitary waste stream is collected and metered prior to discharge to the City of Oklahoma City through a single 24-inch main. 

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists.  Therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.  HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT SOLICITATION ISSUANCE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT MARCH 8, 2004.  

Vendors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought including, commercial market information and company information via e-mail or facsimile (703-767-2382) to Mily Le, no later than February 6, 2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers Day Announcement - Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs)
<DESC>PROPOSERS DAY ANNOUNCEMENT:

	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) announces the Proposers Day for Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs).  The goal of this Proposers Day Workshop is to discuss the goals of this anticipated effort, provide technical discussion on the topics of interest to the program, promote discussion between industry and government, foster teaming among potential proposers, and answer questions.

The objective of Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs is to develop technologies to automatically and dynamically reconfigure Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)-based systems against cyber attack in order to support successful execution of missions in the face of malicious attacks that may include computer worms, malicious code, remote cyber intrusions, and soft and hard run-time failures.  Approaches are expected to build technology to be deployed on network nodes that will sense attacks and failures then dynamically reconfigure the networked system as necessary to successfully achieve mission goals.  The goals of this program are to: (1) dynamically reconfigure the networked system in the face of malicious attacks and failures, (2) limit false reconfigurations to rare events, and (3) ensure good system throughput does not significantly degrade on average over the duration of an attack between any two source-destination pairs on the MANET.

The workshop will be held at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington VA 22202 on February 18, 2004, beginning at 9:00 am and ending at 4:30 pm, to be followed by a reception from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm.  Registration will begin at 8:00 am.  The workshop will present an overview of Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs, and include invited presentations, poster session, discussions, and Q&A.  If interested in attending the workshop please send an e-mail to Leanne Wiegand, lwiegand@snap.org.  You will receive a registration form to fill in and return.  Forms should be returned by 12 February 2004 to attend workshop.  Due to space limitations, each organization is limited to three people.  Workshop attendees must be US Citizens. Attendance at the Proposers' Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements or research solicitations on this topic. It is anticipated that the cost for workshop attendance will be approximately $125 per attendee.  DARPA will not provide cost reimbursement for workshop attendance.

Workshop participants are invited to present in areas of technical competence related to Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs for purposes of technical discussion and teaming. Areas of technical competence for this program may include in no particular order: wireless networking, information security, reconfigurable logic, hardware design, emergent algorithms, machine learning, stochastic inference and control, distributed fault diagnosis, among others. Due to limited time, presenters will be selected from submitted abstracts for 10-minute time slots, including set-up and break-down. Abstracts must be received by 26 January 2004 and are limited to 250 words.  All submitted abstracts will be provided to workshop attendees.  If you wish to submit an abstract for presentation consideration, please inform Leanne Wiegand in your initial e-mail. 

Additionally, there will be a poster session during the workshop.  Attendees who wish to prepare posters must contact Leanne Wiegand lwiegand@snap.org for further information about additional costs and restrictions on display of posters.  Program information from the Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs Proposers' Day may be posted to the website: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/MANETdefense/index.htm after the workshop.

All materials submitted to and presented at the Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs Proposers Day Workshop must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager.  The DARPA Program Manager will screen the material for sensitive, but unclassified material.  For this reason, any material you wish to present at the workshop, including presentations and posters, must be received not later than 12 February 2004 in order to receive consideration.  It is the presenters responsibility to ensure the material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded the research.  Written confirmation of this approval is requested when the material is submitted for the Program Managers review.

Defense Against Cyber Attacks on MANETs starts with the premise that next generation Network Centric Warfare (NCW) systems will experience cyber attacks, hardware and software failures that without the availability of dynamic reconfiguration technology will prevent the successful execution of missions.  The most severe cyber threat is expected to be worms with arbitrary payload that can infect and saturate MANET-based networks on the order of seconds.  In addition, other attacks and software and hardware failures are expected to impede the ability for distributed applications that run over heterogeneous NCW platforms to successfully execute their missions.  As such, human-required response will be insufficient to counter the threat space and to maintain mission integrity in the face of virulent attacks and failures. 

Network Centric Warfare systems will run powerful computing engines and be highly networked using mobile ad hoc networks where nodes serve as both terminals and routers.  Mobile ad hoc networks dynamically form and re-organize in the battlefield from a mixture of heterogeneous platforms including unattended ground sensors (UGS), manned and unmanned ground vehicles, handheld devices, radios, and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).  Together, the varied platforms execute distributed applications in order to achieve the NCW mission.  MANET-based systems bring little supporting infrastructure with them, but most of the vulnerabilities of enterprise-class systems that are porous to concerted cyber attacks and worm-based attacks.  As a result, in MANET-based systems, power is constrained, bandwidth is limited, connectivity is intermittent, and communication channels are subject to fading, path loss, and a low signal to noise ratio.  In addition, MANET-based systems lack a physical security perimeter common to enterprise systems, so MANET nodes can be easily overrun, captured, and reverse engineered.  The wireless communication channel provides easy passive analysis and potential for disruption from adversaries.  MANET-based systems also exhibit properties of unbounded networks: no single node has global visibility or control over the entire network; network topology and membership is highly dynamic; direct connectivity is limited, participants may be unknown or untrusted; physical and logical network boundaries are unknown and dynamic.

Proposed solutions are constrained by properties of unbounded tactical networks such that: (1) any given node has only partial information about the network at any given time, (2) any given node can communicate directly with a number of nodes less than proportional to the total number of nodes in the network, or simply with near neighbors, (3) solutions must utilize the inherently peer-to-peer network topology, (4) nodes may coordinate actions, but each node can only enforce control on itself.  

The key research challenges that must be addressed in an integrated solution are: (1) distributed detection of malicious/infected/corrupted nodes; (2) dynamic reconfiguration and provisioning of battlefield computing services (e.g., GPS, tracking, common operational picture, threat information) or computational resources via coordinated autonomous operation of nodes ; (3) self-stabilizing behavior within bounded time for dynamic reconfiguration algorithms; (4) distinguishing malicious behavior from legitimate behavior; (5) identifying corrupted components and data to enable automatic reconstitution after attack; and (6) ensuring the cost of the response is much less than the cost of the event.

<DESC>Sole Source Contract for DYNASMART-P technical support, to be provided by the software developer, University of Maryland.  DYNASMART-P represents a new generation of tools in support of traffic operations and planning decisions in the ITS and non-ITS environments.  The model algorithms are new and complex to the user community.  Therefore, providing adequate technical support becomes essential.  Currently, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is planning to release DYNASMART-P through McTrans and to provide technical support, through UMD.  The main objectives of this project are (1) to provide training courses on DYNASMART-P, (2) to provide technical support to the FHWA and DYNASMART-P users and (3) to refine DYNASMART-P.  This will be a three-year project with one base year and two option years.  The FHWA will assess the needs for providing technical support for each option year on a yearly basis. The approximate performance period of this project will be from March 2004 through April  2007.  

The FHWA R&D initiated a Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) research project to meet these data needs and to address complex traffic control and management issues in the information-based, dynamic ITS environment. Under this project, two prototypes of Traffic Estimation and Prediction System for Operations Planning (TrEPS-P) have been developed. These two prototypes (DynaMIT-P and DYNASMART-P) were developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Maryland (UMD), respectively.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the DTA project manager designated by the FHWA, completed a laboratory evaluation of both prototypes in June 2000. DYNASMART-P was recommended for further field test and public release.  Based on the recommendation, UMD completed the field test of DYNASMART-P using the planning datasets provided by the Knoxville Metropolitan Transportation Commission in August 2002.  Currently the FHWA and UMD are conducting a beta test of DYNASMART-P.  Upon completion of the beta test, DYNASMART-P will be refined and packaged for release in early 2004.  

Telephoned, E-Mailed, Faxed, Or Letter Requests for the RFP (Request for Proposals) Will Not Be Accepted.   All prospective offerors are to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps, at http://www.eps.gov.  Any subsequent Amendments to the RFP will Likewise be published in FedBizOpps at the Internet address cited above, and the FHWA does Not plan to mail out any Hard copies of any such Amendments. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each offeror to closely and frequently Monitor FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP. Monitoring FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP will be absolutely Essential for all prospective offerors, since Amendments usually contain crucial information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Proposal number is N62645-04-R-0003.  Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-16 are incorporated.  NAICS 423450.  Naval Medical Logistics Command has the following requirement for a ceiling mounted medical examination light.  The resulting contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract with a 3-year ordering period containing a minimum for 22 units and a maximum of 500.  The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate with Offerors on an open competition basis to procure ceiling mounted medical examination lights for Navy ships of the line.  Offerors are required to forward proposal and technical documentation by  21 Jan 04. 

Technical evaluations will be conducted in three stages. Stage 1 is compliance with minimum salient essential characteristics. Stage 2 will be the evaluation of Past Performance information and a confirmation of a complete pricing proposal. Stage 3 will be the shipboard installation and demonstration of the product and the evaluation of the pricing proposal. The Technical Proposal shall address all the minimum salient characteristics.  The Government will not assume that the offeror possesses any capability unless it is specified in the proposal. Proposals should include Past Performance Information from three sources to include: 1.) Agency name; 2.) Agency point of contact and telephone number; 3.) Contract number; 4.) Type and number of units provided; and 5.) Delivery and Performance Information (Contract delivery schedules and actual delivery schedules.) 6.) Quality (Total number of units submitted for inspection and total number rejected.)  Proposals should include Pricing on the following items: 1.) Ceiling mounted medical examination light and 2.) Complete installation to make unit fully operational.  Information on the existing mount can be requested via email to Wendy Graybill at wlgraybill@nmlc.med.navy.mil.  Pricing proposals shall include copies of published commercial price lists, or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to the general public for same or similar items. The Government will make award to the responsible offeror submitting the proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  The evaluation of proposals will be based on an evaluation of the technical and price proposals submitted by each offeror and the shipboard installation and demonstration.  The technical evaluation factors are significantly more important than cost.  In the event that two or more technical proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, the award may be made to the lower price proposal.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the low offeror.  Award may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions.  Therefore, offerors are cautioned that each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms.  Failure to submit any information requested would result in a determination that the technical or pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Technical evaluation will be done in two stages.  Each offer must document compliances in Stage 1 before proceeding to Stage 2. Offerors providing acceptable results from Stage 2 will proceed to Stage 3. 
    
Stage 1: The technical documentation will be compared to the essential minimum salient characteristics and the evaluation factors listed below. Salient characteristics will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  The requirement is for a ceiling mounted medical examination light that has the following essential minimum salient characteristics: 1.) Shall be a ceiling mounted medical examination light; 2.)
