<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center has a requirement for quantity five (5) solar-powered satellite telemetry transmitters configured for external attachment to Long-billed Curlews, total weight not to exceed 18g, delivery not later than 18 April 2008, and quantity five (5) solar-powered satellite telemetry transmitters configured for external attachment to Marbled Godwits, total weight not to exceed 9.5g, delivery not later than 01 June 2008.  Both sizes should be capable of transmitting at night.  In addition to the weight criteria expressed above, the height of the units is important, as overly tall units increase wind resistance (drag), a critical weakness for transmitters intended for use on migratory birds. The USGS is aware of only one manufacturer of suitable transmitters to meet this need (Microwave Telemetry, Inc. of Columbia, MD) and, therefore, intends to fulfill this requirement on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items." Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for quotation (RFQ) 08WRQQ0061 will be made available to Microwave Telemetry, Inc. through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about Wednesday 26 March 2008, IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1). This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-24, effective 28 February 2008.

Fortinet is the only system that meets all Department of State requirements to scan all networks ports at wire speed at the network perimeter. When evaluated as a complete system the Fortinet solution provides substantial capabilities that are either not available with other systems or are offered at additional cost. There are essential management tools in support of domestic and overseas post as it relates to anti-virus software. The USC 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices/Procurement Services Division (DO/PSD), on behalf of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) Office anticipates the competitive award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a  base period plus four one-year option periods.  The anticipated contract type will include four fixed priced, and five time and material Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for a facility and data system capable of implementing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-297, 116 Stat. 2322) (TRIA), as amended, including the Department of the Treasurys Program regulations.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 524292 with a standard size of $6.5 million.

The Department of the Treasury will order a minimum amount of $250,000 under this contract.  Treasury will have the entire term of the contract (to include all options) to fulfill the contract minimum. The specific CLINs and services will be identified in the individual task orders issued under this contract. The exercise of the renewal options does not re-establish the contract minimum. During the life of this contract, Treasury may order items in any quantity up to the maximum amount of $30 million for the entire term of the contract, including all options that may be exercised.

The TRIP Office mission is to implement TRIA as amended. The link for the TRIP website is http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institution/terrorism-insurance/.

Also, under the Federal Share Claims Process tab is the link to a demonstration claims processing site.   

TRIAs purposes are to address market disruptions, ensure the continued widespread availability and affordability of commercial property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk, and to allow for a transition period for private markets to stabilize and build capacity while preserving state insurance regulations and consumer protections.  

The contract requires the contractor to translate TRIA and related regulations into tested and documented operating systems and procedures for the processing of insurer claims for the Federal Share of Compensation. Following a qualifying terrorist event  and upon notice, the contractor will activate the facility, process claims  and operate as statistical agent for the Program.  A brief description of each task is as follows:  CLIN 001: The contractor shall transition, prepare and test a claims management facility; CLIN 002: The contractor shall perform periodic review and readiness testing to include system certification and accreditation; CLIN 003: The contractor shall provide expert analytical support; CLIN 004: The contractor shall perform activation and on-going operation of the claims management facility; CLIN 005: The contractor shall transition and develop and test a statistical agent analysis and reporting capability; CLIN 006: The contractor shall perform periodic review and testing of the statistical agent capability and ensure system security and certification and accreditation; CLIN 007: The contractor shall provide for statistical agent reporting and analysis following activation; CLIN 008: The contractor shall provide for recoupment; and CLIN 009: The contractor shall perform close-out and/or transition of operations.

The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on or after April 14, 2008 on FedBizOpps, the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for federal government procurement opportunities over $25,000.

<DESC>FedBizOpps ? PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE


The Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office, anticipates the award a multiple award IDIQ contract for multiple professional moving service contractors to provide logistical services.  These services would encompass continued logistical services in support of the Pentagon Renovation Project. The services primarily involve relocating furniture and other office equipment within the Pentagon per schedules to be developed after award. In addition, these services could be used on a WHS Enterprise-wide basis to support relocations of DoD components from leased space in the National Capitol Region (NCR) to Fort Belvoir, VA or other preferred site alternatives in the NCR, and as mandated by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act and/or other WHS operational requirements.  Moves would occur both within the Pentagon itself, and from, and to other DoD locations. 

The Pentagon Renovation Project encompasses a complete internal renovation of the entire Pentagon facility including the logistical support and activities required to ready the space for construction and the final tenant moves required when the renovated spaces become fully operational. As of March 1, 2008 there remains approximately 1.4 million square feet and 11,000 staff positions, which will be impacted by future renovation activities. In addition to relocations within the Pentagon, WHS Enterprise-wide related activities may encompass the relocation of approximately 6,200 personnel from leased or government-owned locations in the National Capitol Region including the Pentagon to other leased and/or government-owned locations within the National Capitol Region. 

The government requires that the move service contractors provide and manage all move-related services, to include any surplus.  The moves could be internal (within the Pentagon), external (within the NCR), or a combination of the two.  Internal and external moves usually consist of between 30 and 110 personnel in a day, including classified materials and some specialized equipment. The moves generally occur on a daily basis (potentially Monday through Saturday) at a rate of 250-300 personnel a week.  This, in turn, will occur during a two to four month period of intense activity; i.e., moves every day of every week followed by a lull in activity of 6-10 months. Many of the moves will be internal to the Pentagon but, because of construction activities, may often involve lengthy move routes (?pushes?) of between 1,320 and 3,960 feet in length.  Similarly, moves out of and into the Pentagon itself as well as surplus activities, because they involve moving furniture and equipment in to or out of the Pentagon through the Remote Deliver Facility (RDF), may require even more lengthy move routes since the distance from the RDF itself to the top of the RDF connector is 1380 feet.  Also note that the ramp from the RDF is on an uphill incline. Offerors must plan for security-related delays such as the requirement to badge all workers and inspect vehicles that enter and leave the Pentagon or other secure facilities.

The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis.  The maximum potential ceiling of the IDIQ is $10 million, with individual task orders being competed amongst the resultant contracts on firm-fixed price basis. The performance period is five (5) years, consisting of a base year and four (4) one-year option periods. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 484210.     

The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community the week of March 31 through April 04, 2008, and will be available for access via the FedbizOpps website.  A pre-proposal conference and site tour is projected for the week of April 07 through the April 11, 2008.  Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to keanna.maxwell@whs.mil.  Please ensure the RFP number and project title is referenced on all correspondence.

Although offerors will not need a facility clearance for this requirement, employees will have to undergo a NCIC check in order to secure a badge. 
NOTICE TO OFFERORS:  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUBPART 4.11 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION, PROSPECTIVE VENDORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN CCR PRIOR TO THE AWARD OF A CONTRACT; BASIC AGREEMENT, BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENT, OR BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

<SOLNBR>HQ0147-08-R-0001
<RESPDATE>040408
<ARCHDATE>05052008
<CONTACT>Chanda Tallman, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-1444, Email chanda.tallman@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program (MDA/GMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, Huntsville, Alabama, a new Core Completion Contract for the GMD program that will be comprised of four major work content elements. The four major work content areas that make up the Core Completion Contract include 1) the transfer of activity currently contracted for under HQ0006-01-C-0001 (critical activities necessary to complete the current spiral development), 2) Block 4 hardware and software, 3) European Interceptor Site integration support, and 4) Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities. The GMD Core Completion Contract will be a continuation of past and present BMDS development efforts to complete the current spiral development. 

The proposed acquisition is directed to Boeing pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). These four major work content areas cannot be performed by any source other than Boeing without substantial and unacceptable programmatic risk, duplicative cost, and schedule delays. Only Boeing, the incumbent GMD System Prime contractor, has the necessary engineering, manufacturing, and software knowledge and expertise to perform and manage multiple major sub system developments, hardware/software programs and related integration activities without unacceptable delay to program schedules and unnecessary duplication of sunk development costs which cannot be recouped via competition. 

Boeing, as the current prime contractor for the operational capability, continuing spiral development and test of the GMD element of the BMDS, is the only qualified source to perform this completion effort within cost and schedule constraints. Furthermore, Boeing is the only source with the institutional technical knowledge that is critical for managing and integrating the completion of the ongoing development and fielding of the GMD System. Boeing is the only source with the engineering, manufacturing, software and fielding experience and expertise to conduct, manage and integrate the multiple major sub system developments, site design/build activities and related integration efforts without resulting in unacceptable program delays and enormous duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition. Duplication of prior development costs is unaffordable and would not be recoverable through competition for these requirements. There would be additional schedule and costs delays for the government to conduct extensive re-testing/re-validation to ensure the necessary GMD System capabilities, expertise and knowledge have been successfully transferred to any new system prime contractor. It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's critical schedule requirements and not disrupt current system operational capability.  

This proposed sole-source contract action does not preclude the on-going assessment of the future GMD potential competitive requirements which are a part of our current Request for Information (HQ0147-GMD-RFI-1). For the anticipated Core Completion Contract, a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract vehicle is contemplated. The anticipated period of performance to complete the current spiral development in the GMD Core Completion Contract covers 2nd quarter FY09 through 4th quarter FY13. Findings and conclusions from the on-going RFI are to be presented to a senior Integrated Product Team in the 3rd quarter FY 08 timeframe as a prelude to developing any competitive Request for Proposal(s) for competition candidate requirements.  

The proposed contract action is for work content for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are advised that the GMD program office is currently in spiral development and that adequate system documentation is not currently available. Interested parties who believe they can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost or schedule impacts to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Government's requirements. The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite GMD Sole Source Core Completion Contract Acquisition, and shall be emailed to Ms.Cathy Hill at cathy.hill@mda.mil and Ms.Chanda Tallman at chanda.tallman@mda.mil.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, as outlined above, which will be considered.  

This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.  

This action is not open to allied participation. See Notes 22 and 26.

<CONTACT>Nicole Anderson 850-235-5386  , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source contract to Creare Incorporated for the acquisition of engineering services to produce a Chemical/Biological Agent Resistance Test (CBART) test fixture.  The CBART test fixture will be used to test candidate materials for the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit (JSLIST), an ACAT III program.  The performance of the prototypes will be validated at two test centers, (i.e. Dugway and Battelle) with two rounds of prototyping at each center.  The CBART program was established to address capability shortfalls with current protective materials testing methods established by the Aerosol-Vapor-Liquid Assessment Group (AVLAG).  New test methods/equipment are required to adequately evaluate modern protective materials and provide individual protection equipment developers with the information needed to evaluate performance of components of their products. Creare Incorporated is the only company that can provide this support for the following reasons.   Currently the AVLAG cell is used for assessing the penetration resistance of individual protective (IP) garments against various chemical agents.  The AVLAG cell and system has evolved over years, but a number of drawbacks remain, including significant uncertainties in the resulting data, inefficiency and expense, risk to test personnel, and a limited range of test conditions.   Creare Incorporated is the only company that has provided a concept for the new CBART cell that will enable consistent testing of all material types, reduce uncertainties in measurements, increase realism and range of test conditions, and utilize automation to improve efficiency and personnel safety. Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. Interested firms must request the solicitation in writing or via e-mail to Contract Specialist: Nicole Anderson, Code XPS2, NSWC PCD, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, FL 32407, e-mail nicole.a.anderson1@navy.mil.  Requests should include the prospective offeror's Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, physical mailing address, email address, point of contact and telephone number. Telephone requests will not be accepted. FSC Code: AN14 NAICS Code: 541711, Size Standard: 500.  The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 21 Jun 2008.

<RESPDATE>051208
<ARCHDATE>03212009
<CONTACT>Sara Oletski Contracting Officer 3032366498     Sara_Oletski@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation Number NAR080070 applies and will be issued as a Request for Proposals for the following services: Contractor will provide a means to allow all visitors to the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area a reasonable way to purchase a permit, at any time before arrival, or in the dunes, to allow visitors to be compliant with the BLM supplemental fee rule and the Imperial County fee ordinance. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: Background - The Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area (ISDRA), managed by the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) El Centro Field Office, is located in eastern Imperial County, California.  At 40 miles long and averaging five miles in width, it covers almost 160,000 acres, the largest area for sand dune off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation experience in the U.S.  It draws visitors from throughout California as well as other States, and receives the highest visitor use concentration of any BLM recreation area in the country. General - The contractor shall provide the following services: collect non-commercial special recreation permit fees (dunes permit) through the most efficient combination of the following methods: off-site sales, on-site sales and/or fee collection kiosks. The contractor shall also educate visitors of pertinent State, County and applicable Federal law as it relates to fee collection and compliance.   Collection Objective - The goal will be to increase off site sales by 10% each year until 80% of all permit sales are completed off site.  2007 will be considered the base year. Objective will be measured by monthly reports of on and off site sales.  In 2007, 12,478 or 14% of all Dunes permits were sold out of the fee area.  BLM is striving to have the majority of all permits sold off site to reduce the workload and traffic congestion in the recreation area. Compliance Objective - Contractor will educate visitors and gain voluntary compliance with the County fee ordinance in order to maintain fee compliance at a minimum level of 80% at any time.  BLM will respond to the contractor's request for assistance when there is a visitor who refuses to comply with permit regulations.   The awarded contract will include performance incentives for the collection and compliance objectives above. Additional information will be posted in the solicitation. The standard NAICS classification is 721211.  Size standard is $6.5 million.  The Government intends to award this contract on an all-or-none basis. The solicitation will be issued on or about April 11, 2008.  The solicitation may be downloaded from the IDEASEC website:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/j2ee/login.jsp.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Carleton Technologies for the acquisition of a primary variable regulator bench-top prototype with the design of the mechanical components modified from the current Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Secondary Oxygen Pack (SOP) regulator (SV 799042) for use in the newly redesigned Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Spacesuit systems to support the mission for the Constellation Program. The contractor shall provide analysis and design to adapt the current Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) SOP regulator design to meet the requirements in accordance with the attached Statement of Work and as specified within the spec, fabrication of a bench-top prototype with functional requirements specified in the spec, development of control algorithms and software in Lab VIEW for control of the bench-top prototype and delivery of the prototype hardware, control software, and associated specific support equipment such as interface cables, connectors, etc.   The Statement of Work can be viewed at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ08240787/SOW_Primary_Variable_Reg_Bench-top_Prototype_ 3-19-08.doc    The Specifications can be viewed at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ08240787/Primary_Variable_Regulator_Spec.pdf  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the services/items from Carleton Technologies. Carleton Technologies is the sole supplier the primary variable regulator bench-top prototype that meets NASA JSC?s zero leakage capabilities requirements which have been continuously proven in the use of NASA?s current EMU SOP. The existing space suit is being redesigned for simplicity, high reliability, on-orbit maintenance, and robustness in adverse conditions. Among the improvements being employed is the evolution of the oxygen regulators currently used on the Shuttle EMU to include a wider performance band, continuous pressure variability vs. two discrete set-points, and included ability to treat Decompression Sickness (DCS) symptoms either during an EVA excursion or during Intra-Vehicular Activities (IVA) after an EVA. The current Shuttle EMU requires separate hardware and several minutes to engage limited DCS treatment; adding the in-suit DCS treatment as part of the regulator design will reduce the health risk to the Crew. The addition of continuous variability to the pressure regulation set-point will allow for the regulator to adjust the suit pressure and minimize the ?pre-breathe? or time spent breathing pure oxygen ahead of an EVA. By evolving the proven Shuttle EMU SOP regulator design to include these upgrades for the new space suite, there is reduced risk to safety, reliability, cost, and schedule associated with the design because it is an evolution of a proven design rather than a new design which would be untested in many aspects increasing overall risk to the crew. The current SOP regulator design has been in use in the Shuttle EMU for more than 20 years without a single flight failure; it has also demonstrated impeccable oxygen compatibility performance when tested and evaluated at the White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested parties may submit their proposal to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later then 3:30 p.m. local time on April 4, 2008. Such proposals will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer with shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) mission is to ensure health care security to all beneficiaries.  In carrying out this mission, CMS is dedicated to the highest integrity of its programs and has contracted with various entities for benefit integrity functions.  Originally, program integrity efforts were aligned with CMS' fiscal intermediaries and carriers.  The recent enactment of section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) changes CMS' current contracting structure by phasing out the fiscal intermediaries and carriers and phasing in the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) for CMS Medicare claims processing.  As a result of the MMA and the adoption of the MAC strategy, a realignment of the program integrity jurisdictions is necessary so that workloads align with the new MACs. In addition, the future intent of these realignments is to have one program integrity contractor be responsible for the detection, deterrence and prevention of fraud, waste, and abuse across all claim types.

CMS has established seven (7) jurisdictional zones to deal efficiently with fraud, waste and abuse issues which also align effectively with multiple MAC jurisdictions.  CMS will be procuring the seven (7) zones in three (3) separate cycles.   

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for two (2) zones as follows:

ZPIC Cycle Two
Zone 2:  Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, North      Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. 

Zone 1:  California, Nevada, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam and the Mariana Islands.

It is anticipated that two (2) separate stand alone single IDIQ contracts will be awarded, one for each zone, with a base period plus 4 option years. CMS intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competition. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of Request for Proposal in mid-April.  The solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.   It is anticipated that this cycle will be awarded before December 31, 2008.

<DESC>United States Government Seeks Expressions of Interest for Office and Related Space
in Northern Virginia

Requirement:

The United States currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Northern Virginia, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 209,737 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 184,237 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for ten (10) years, with an option to terminate the lease after five (5) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by May 31, 2008.  The delineated area is Northern Virginia, within 2,500 walkable linear feet of a metrorail station.  The Lessor shall provide 16 covered parking spaces, for use by official Government vehicles, located inside the building's parking garage.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.

Please send expression of interest to:

CB Richard Ellis, Inc.              
8270 Greensboro Drive, Suite 620
McLean, VA. 22102
ATTN: Henry Chapman
henry.chapman@cbre.com

Telephone:  703-288-2565

Expressions of interest must be submitted to the above address by 3:00 p.m. on April 11, 2008, and must include the following information:

-- Building name and address.
-- Rental rate information quotation per rentable square foot 
     for a ten (10) year term, with an option to terminate the 
     lease after five (5) years and a $42.08 tenant improvement 
     allowance.
-- ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and 
     expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.
-- Date of space availability and schedule for completion.
-- Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space.
-- Method of rentable space measurement.
-- Building Ownership Information.
-- Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.
-- List of building services provided.

The Government's decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government's requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

<DESC>The Department of Education intends to make a sole source award to the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), located in Washington, DC, for the establishment of a new Education Policy Working Group on Education Systems and Accountability (hereinafter referred to as the "Education Working Group").  The purpose of the Education Working Group is to foster ongoing discussion among federal and state officials, education policymakers and constituency representatives, and education researchers on key education policy issues that are likely to impact the national, state, and local levels both during and following the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).  The activities of the Education Working Group will help to bridge the perspectives and concerns of these different groups and inform the evolution of education policy in important areas such as education system alignment, the use of data, and accountability.  The thoughts and recommendations of this group are of great interest to the Department, and in particular, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. The NRC will be tasked with designing and carrying out the activities associated with the Education Working Group. The NRC has been determined to be the most responsive and has a unique capability to meet the Department?s needs. The NRC has knowledge and experience with conducting roundtables and focus groups on education accountability, and governance for officials at all levels of government. The NRC?s Board of Testing and Accountability demonstrates the experience in convening experts in education to examine issues related to assessment and accountability. The NRC also functions under National Academies, which is comprised of over 6,000 experts with expertise on collecting, analyzing, and sharing information and knowledge. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 6.302-1.
The Department will afford qualified and interested parties an opportunity to submit capability statements outlining experience directly relevant to this requirement. The Government will consider information received within 45 days of this synopsis.

This NSN follows under that scope. There will be no separate solicitation issued for this action. Specifications, plans, or drawings are available. However, this acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The SBA district office approved the geographical boundaries for firms with bonafide offices within SBA Region VI which includes Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. As such, competition is limited to firms located within SBA Region 6.  Offerors are encouraged to refer to the performance qualifications established by the Small Business Administration.  Offerors that are not listed on the SBA list of qualifying 8(a) fir ms at the time of proposal submission, and at the time of contract award will be rejected as nonresponsive.

Note to offerors:  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation, either before or after the date set for submission of proposals, with no obligation to  the offeror by the Government.  A single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation, and consist of a base period (from date of contract award through one year) and four option periods.

PLEASE CONTACT  BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES: DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD? The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, ?scrub?) is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or  resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble  Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force  Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew  participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556  ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing  SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision  regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for  implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE  SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE  BASE (AFB) DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER WERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT  BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES: DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD? The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, ?scrub?) is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or  resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble  Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force  Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew  participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556  ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing  SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision  regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for  implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part  of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to  the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs  being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be  implemented in the Training System.

<SOLNBR>HQ0147-08-R-0001
<RESPDATE>040408
<ARCHDATE>05052008
<CONTACT>Chanda Tallman, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-1444, Fax null, Email chanda.tallman@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program (MDA/GMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, Huntsville, Alabama, a new Core Completion Contract for the GMD program that will be comprised of four major work content elements. The four major work content areas that make up the Core Completion Contract include 1) the transfer of activity currently contracted for under HQ0006-01-C-0001 (critical activities necessary to complete the current spiral development), 2) Block 4 hardware and software, 3) European Interceptor Site integration support, and 4) Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities. The GMD Core Completion Contract will be a continuation of past and present BMDS development efforts to complete the current spiral development. Based on current operational schedules, this spiral must be completed by 4th quarter FY 13.

The proposed acquisition is directed to Boeing pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). These four major work content areas cannot be performed by any source other than Boeing without substantial and unacceptable programmatic risk, duplicative cost, and schedule delays. Only Boeing, the incumbent GMD System Prime contractor, has the necessary engineering, manufacturing, and software knowledge and expertise to perform and manage multiple major sub system developments, hardware/software programs and related integration activities without unacceptable delay to program schedules and unnecessary duplication of sunk development costs which cannot be recouped via competition. 

Boeing, as the current prime contractor for the operational capability, continuing spiral development and test of the GMD element of the BMDS, is the only qualified source to perform this completion effort within cost and schedule constraints. Furthermore, Boeing is the only source with the institutional technical knowledge that is critical for managing and integrating the completion of the ongoing development and fielding of the GMD System. Boeing is the only source with the engineering, manufacturing, software and fielding experience and expertise to conduct, manage and integrate the multiple major sub system developments, site design/build activities and related integration efforts without resulting in unacceptable program delays and enormous duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition. Duplication of prior development costs is unaffordable and would not be recoverable through competition for these requirements. There would be additional schedule and costs delays for the government to conduct extensive re-testing/re-validation to ensure the necessary GMD System capabilities, expertise and knowledge have been successfully transferred to any new system prime contractor. It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's critical schedule requirements and not disrupt current system operational capability.  

This proposed sole-source contract action does not preclude the on-going assessment of the future GMD potential competitive requirements which are a part of our current Request for Information (HQ0147-GMD-RFI-1). For the anticipated Core Completion Contract, a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract vehicle is contemplated. The anticipated period of performance to complete the current spiral development in the GMD Core Completion Contract covers 2nd quarter FY09 through 4th quarter FY13. Findings and conclusions from the on-going RFI are to be presented to a senior Integrated Product Team in the 3rd quarter FY 08 timeframe as a prelude to developing any competitive Request for Proposal(s) for competition candidate requirements.  

The proposed contract action is for work content for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are advised that the GMD program office is currently in spiral development and that adequate system documentation is not currently available. Interested parties who believe they can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost or schedule impacts to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Government's requirements. The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite GMD Sole Source Core Completion Contract Acquisition, and shall be emailed to Ms.Cathy Hill at cathy.hill@mda.mil and Ms.Chanda Tallman at chanda.tallman@mda.mil.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, as outlined above, which will be considered.  

This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.  

This action is not open to allied participation. See Notes 22 and 26.

In addition, anyone planning to import pesticides for use in the U.S. is required to notify EPA.

The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has instituted procedures for the registration and ongoing re-registration of pesticides. Data submitted by pesticide manufacturers (registrants), other EPA programs, other Federal agencies, the states, Indian tribes, cities, municipalities and private citizens, and data published in public, open literature are used to determine whether pesticides and their proposed uses may pose an unreasonable adverse effect on human health and the environment. OPP evaluates the data and determines whether the data are adequate for regulatory decision-making or whether additional data are required from the registrants, performs hazard and risk assessments on the data to decide whether the pesticide or its proposed uses should be registered in compliance the FIFRA, and determines whether new procedures or methodologies for estimating possible pesticide hazards to human must be developed. Under the proposed contract, the Contractor shall: 1) Review and Evaluation of Health-related Pesticide Toxicity Data; 2) Test Guideline Support; 3) Pathology Evaluations; 5) Special Projects: Evaluations of Complex Toxicological Data and Issues; and 6) Conduct Backup Literature Search and Hard Copy Acquisition.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Environmental Management (EM) is seeking qualified businesses (including teams or joint ventures) to perform cost-effective commercial treatment of liquid and solid polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), mixed low-level waste (MLLW) and other low-level wastes.  This announcement is part of market research and anticipated responses are sought to identify sources that have the comprehensive knowledge, skills, and capacity to perform these requirements. DOE requests qualified, interested parties to demonstrate that they have, or will have, the capability and required authorizations, licenses, permits, facilities, personnel, and equipment to accomplish the acceptance, transportation, storage, repackaging and treatment of DOE wastes.  This includes development and maintenance of treatment plans, coordination and notification of regulators, and disposition of all residual, byproduct and secondary wastes.  The tentative period of performance is FY 2009-2018. Attachment 1 includes current estimates of volumes, by assumed general treatment technology that may be generated through DOE mission activities, including environmental cleanup.  This data is based on the waste forecasts contained in the Departmentýýýs baseline disposition data (2007) and provides a bounding case for planning purposes.  The estimates reflect preliminary processes and plans, informed by past experience.  Attachment 2, Table 1 provides waste estimates that are currently planned to be treated by the Oak Ridge Toxic Substances Control Act Incinerator (TSCAI).  This data is excerpted from the Departmentýýýs current TSCAI Burn Plan and forecasts of potential wastes.  The Department is especially interested in obtaining industry input on the feasibility of commercial treatment of these types of wastes, as TSCAI may cease operations in the near future.  Attachment 2, Table 2 provides other future wastes which currently have no final disposition path.  Parties are encouraged to provide alternative disposition strategies for any wastes that may not require licensed treatment and disposal.  The volumes in the attachments are DOE volumes only.  In accordance with the Economy Act, DOE is authorized to allow other federal agencies to utilize DOE contract vehicles" as provided for in FAR 17.5, but DOE will not seek waste volumes from other Federal Agencies for solicitation purposes. The Department desires to better understand the capability of the private sector to handle these challenges.  The Department solicits your organizationýýýs ideas, opinions, and interest in participating in all or part of the Departmentýýý s treatment of the PCB, TSCA and MLLW.  Information provided in response to this Expressions of Interest (EOI) will assist the Department in determining the best acquisition approach. DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate, including, but not limited to, the creation of a competitive solicitation. An interested party should avoid including any classified, business confidential, and/or proprietary information in its response to the EOI.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review such information and safeguard it appropriately. The Department is seeking interested companies, including small business and small business teams (i.e., small disadvantaged, 8( a), women owned, Hubzone, service-disabled veteran-owned, and participants in a Mentor-Protýýgýýýýý program, etc.) with specialized capabilities to meet all, or part of, the above requirements.  Interested firms with the experience, expertise and licensed or permitted capability to perform this work shall provide a summary of their capabilities, experience and/or expertise in this type of work.

The lower rate shall be applied to this contract by way of a bi-lateral contract modification within 30 days of the utilization of the lower rate.  The new lower rate shall be made retroactive to the date that the contractor afforded the lower rate to customer(s) outside of this contract. Any Order in effect at the time of the price change shall be modified or adjusted as required to reflect the new lower rate.  The contractor shall make every attempt to invoice at the lower rate.  If an invoice goes out prior to making the proper downward adjustment the contract shall make an appropriate refund. Article 4.  52.212-2  Evaluation - Commercial Items. (Jan 1999) (Tailored) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>Request for Information
316th Contracting Squadron
CES/CEOE Section
Andrews AFB, MD 20762
As of 21 March 08
 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services.  It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government.  The information requested will be used by the 316th Contracting Squadron to facilitate decision making.

The 316th CES/CEOE is seeking interested sources to provide maintenance support for Barrier1 Vehicle & Marine Traffic Security Barrier located at Andrews AFB, MD 20762. (www.barrier1.us)  Maintenance shall be performed in accordance with manufacturer?s current recommendations and specifications manuals. All work shall be performed by qualified technicians specifically trained to work on barrier systems.

The service provider?s maintenance and inspection program shall be based upon original equipment manufacturer?s recommendations, contractor expertise and standard industry practices.  At a minimum, the service provider shall perform monthly maintenance and inspections.  Mechanical and electrical safety checks shall be completed to ensure the safety of all systems.  The purpose of this work is to prevent and correct equipment deficiencies, minimize breakdowns and service interruptions, extend barrier system life and maximize efficient operation.  

Service call repairs are those not defined as preventive maintenance and may be in the form of either emergency or non-emergency calls when a barrier system is non-operational. All deficiencies shall be corrected during the service call repairs whenever possible or within a maximum of one (1) business day.  The service provider shall have all equipment and material required to start work upon arrival at the service location.  All repair work shall be in accordance with normal commercial practices using parts specified by the barrier manufacturer or items of equal or better quality.  Downtime of the barrier system shall be kept to an absolute minimum.  The service provider must notify the customer of all projected downtime and estimated time for repair.

The 316th Contracting Squadron seeks to learn from industry the unique aspects or procedures mandated for barrier maintenance. Preliminary research suggests that the scope of the contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, the agency seeks large and small business respondents who are currently conducting maintenance on barriers within the United States or are interested in doing so.  The input will help the Air Force ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors.  A review of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds that NAICS 561621 (Security Systems Services) is appropriate for this request. Comments on the NAICS code selection are welcomed.  If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire and provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative the Government may contact for additional information.  E-mailed responses are required.  

Notice:  The Air Force has non-government (contractor) employees assisting with its market research.  These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.  
Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the 316th requirements.  Individual capability briefs will not be accepted at this time.  Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding 316th needs.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.  Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices.  To register for this service, click on "Vendor Notification Service" at the FedBizOpps home page.  Then click on the subscription option desired and follow the instructions.  This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. 
Please note, the government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.  

Send responses to the following POCs no later than 4 April 08.

<DESC>Description (Request for Information)
The United States Special Operation Command (USSOCOM) is conducting a request for information for senior advisor services with experience in technical areas of concern to SOCOM.  The advisor, must possess a doctoral degree in Engineering and must have served in an advisory role to other senior military commands.  The advisor/firm must possess an in depth understanding of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and newly developed or product improved non nuclear munitions, as required by MIL STD 2105C.  The advisor/firm must have a working knowledge of the process involved in developing IM insensitive systems, which will reduce collateral damage in the event of an accident from unplanned stimuli.
The advisor/firm must be a recognized expert in this area and articulate with the Joint Insensitive Munitions Technical Panel and the DOD Integrated Program Team (IPT) panels.  Advisor/firm must have experience in writing and assembling a Strategic Plan.  Advisor/firm must have knowledge of all munitions in the SOCOM Fiscal Year Defense Program (FYDP), and their susceptibility to IM stimuli.
Since munitions contain explosives, propellant and fuzes, the applicant/firm must have a working knowledge of insensitive explosives. The applicant/firm must be capable of showing through publications for International Conferences and peer groups, their ability to design and develop propellant venting technologies as applied to high and mid caliber artillery guns.
Since fuzes are an integral part of insensitive munitions, the advisor/firm must possess a working knowledge of fuzing systems for mortars, artillery, rockets, bombs, grenades and other explosive devices.
Specific knowledge of power sources, both chemical and non-chemical is required to evaluate systems adherence to MIL STD 1316.  In many cases, the fuze is the road block in achieving IM compliance for a munition; the advisor must then propose new fuze designs to make the munition safer and become IM compliant.  Electronic/mechanical arming systems must be part of the advisor?s experience. Advisors/firms must have a working knowledge of Special Forces equipment, i.e., radio transmitters/receivers, man-powered generators and training devices as applied to the soldier worn MILES harness system.
Advisor/firm must have a long term experience of military systems having contributed to these systems by means of patents, publications, reports, and physical hardware.
Interested firms, capable of supplying this service, should provide the following information: cage code, company name, address, phone number, email address, a point of contact, business size, and type of company within NAICS  541330. 
Also, contractors shall not provide specific product literature however emphasis should be put on the advisor?s/firm?s capabilities. General company product literature will not be considered a response. Please fill out attached Capabilities Spreadsheet with yes or no responses. Please address if there is a need for an administrative assistant. Information shall be submitted to Kenyona Wilson, Contract Specialist at Kenyona.Wilson.ctr@socom.mil or to Denise Green-Huneke, Contracting Officer at cdenise.green-huneke@socom.mil, no later than 1400 EDT on April 3, 2008.   
This is a request or information only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  This notice shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.

<DESC>Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenic Episode (RAISE)

INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business)  for a project entitled, Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenic Episode (RAISE).  

The Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenic Episode (RAISE) initiative seeks to fundamentally change the trajectory and prognosis of schizophrenia through coordinated and aggressive treatment in the earliest stages of illness.   The specific aims of this initiative are: 

1.      To develop a comprehensive and integrated treatment intervention that can be delivered in real world practice settings to promote symptomatic recovery, minimize disability, and maximize social, academic, and vocational functioning; 

2.      To test its feasibility and practical implementation in the community; and 

3.      To assess its overall clinical impact and cost-effectiveness as compared to currently prevailing treatment approaches.

The offeror must present a well-developed conceptual model of the early post-psychosis stage of schizophrenia and describe a coordinated treatment approach that addresses the unique characteristics and needs of newly ill individuals.   NIMH envisions three phases to the project: 
(1) a period for refining the intervention based on iterative feedback from a small number of clinicians and patients; 
(2) a feasibility study to demonstrate that the intervention can be fielded in real world community treatment settings; and, 
(3) the implementation of a practical clinical trial built around the typical patients, clinicians, and payment mechanisms encountered in routine clinical practice.  

NIMH envisions an 8-year timeframe to progress from the intervention refinement phase to completion of the practical clinical trial. (Note:  the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541712, 500 employees/revenue).

The information from this market research will help DSIR/NIMH plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  DSIR/NIMH WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.
      
BACKGROUND

The first episode of psychosis represents a critical event in the course of schizophrenia, and a unique opportunity for intervention.  The best, perhaps only chance for altering the discouraging prognosis commonly associated with schizophrenia is to intervene aggressively at the first episode of psychosis, before functional abilities are lost.  The RAISE initiative will test this hypothesis by supporting the development, deployment, and testing of an early intervention model for schizophrenia that is relevant to the U.S. mental health system, in the sense that - if found to be effective in real world settings and relatively cost-effective - it could be deployed feasibly at a population level.

RAISE is innovative in two respects.  First, RAISE will shift the focus of schizophrenia treatment away from managing end stage disease to early and aggressive treatment.  The goal here is indicated prevention that pre-empts symptomatic and functional deterioration in the early years of illness.  We hypothesize that effective early intervention may shift the long-term trajectory of illness away from chronic disability towards more normal functioning.  Second, RAISE represents a coordinated effort to design and test an intervention for early phase schizophrenia that should be feasible to implement on a wide, i.e., population-level, scale.  From the earliest stages of development, this intervention will incorporate necessary features for rapid dissemination, adoption, and implementation in our communities, thus facilitating the transition from research to practice.  The ultimate goal is to transform the current paradigm for treating schizophrenia in the United States by engineering rapid adoption and implementation of an effective treatment package on a broad scale.

To accomplish the goals outlined above, NIMH advocates a clinic-based, deployment-focused treatment development process.  As its name implies, the clinic-based, deployment-focused model anticipates the clinical, economic, and logistical characteristics of the settings where an intervention will be delivered during development and pilot-testing, as well as the settings where it will ultimately be implemented in the real world.  The model encourages collaboration among scientific content experts, services researchers, and end users to anticipate clinical and practical circumstances that can impede adoption and implementation of an effective intervention in community settings.  These features include characteristics of typical patients, clinicians already available in target settings, training and supervision requirements necessary to introduce new approaches, space, time, and material resource constraints, and likely payment mechanisms for the new intervention.  By attending to these issues early on it is more likely that health care providers, administrators, payers, and policy makers will be able and willing to adopt and implement any intervention(s) developed and tested in RAISE.  

To maximize the chances for developing and testing a clinically relevant and transportable intervention for first episode schizophrenia, NIMH requires offerors to demonstrate working relationships with relevant stakeholder groups at the time the proposal is submitted.  Examples of relevant stakeholders include members of consumer and advocacy organizations, representatives of real world delivery systems that regularly encounter individuals in the earliest phase of schizophrenia, and purchasers of health care and disability benefits at state and local levels.  NIMH does not require applicants to possess established relationships with relevant Federal-level partners at the time the proposal is submitted.  Examples of relevant Federal-level partners include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the Department of Justice (DoJ).  Once an award is made, the offeror should expect to work closely with NIMH to establish active partnerships with one or more policy-making Federal stakeholders whose missions intersect with the care of persons with schizophrenia.  

From a scientific perspective, the RAISE initiative seeks to explore whether the early course of schizophrenia can be altered, from the first psychotic episode forward.  However, when a patient first presents with psychotic symptoms, it is often unclear which DSM-IV diagnosis is most appropriate.  Depending on the characteristics and duration of symptoms at the time of presentation, a variety of diagnoses are possible, including brief reactive psychosis, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and either bipolar disorder or major depression with psychotic features.  Diagnostic uncertainty for newly ill individuals is encountered frequently in real world treatment settings, and it is unrealistic to expect that clinicians will withhold treatment until a definitive diagnosis is established.  Consequently, NIMH requires that the scope of RAISE include all persons experiencing a first episode of psychosis that could plausibly lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.    

RESPONSE INFORMATION

In order to respond to this notice, potential sources should briefly discuss their experience and/or ability to perform each of the six (6) items below:

NIMH anticipates that collaboration between multiple scientific investigators and organizations will be required.   The specific experience and capabilities necessary to perform this work include (but are not limited to):
1)       Experience in performing large scale effectiveness trials in schizophrenia, and randomized clinical trials in first episode patients, specifically;
2)       Ability to recruit significant numbers of subjects experiencing an initial psychotic episode from multiple representative community sites, and ability to retain and follow up subjects in an ongoing clinical trial
3)       The capability to develop a comprehensive and integrated treatment model involving pharmacological, psychosocial, rehabilitative, and therapeutic case management interventions to promote long term recovery and forestall loss of function in people in a first psychotic episode;
4)       The capability to develop appropriate outcome measures and control conditions;    
5)       The capability to provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with schizophrenia.    
6)       Experience collaborating with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, policy makers, advocates, and consumers) in schizophrenia research.

3.	Background
The Office of Workers? Compensation Programs (OWCP/DFEC) administers the Federal Employees? Compensation Act (FECA).  FECA provides workers? compensation coverage to three million Federal and Postal workers including wage replacement, medical and vocational rehabilitation benefits for work-related injury and occupational disease.  Compensation claims filed under the Federal Employee Compensation Act are processed by the Division of Federal Employees? Compensation (DFEC) program?s 12 District offices around the nation.  

The process of adjudicating and managing these compensation claims requires Claims Examiners within DFEC District Offices to review a variety of documents that must be maintained as part of the case processing record of each claim.  These documents provide the supporting evidence of determinations regarding the admissibility of treatments, the amount of compensation to be granted, and other decisions related to the claim.  These case files, which can range in size from fewer than 20 pages to well over 1000, pose a significant paperwork management challenge for DFEC. 

4.	General Requirements
The Contractor will provide a services solution that meets the following general requirements:

Project Management 
The Contractor shall ensure all project financial management and earned value processes are consistent with OMB, DOL, and Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) guidance.

Document Tracking 

The Contractor shall provide automated inventory tracking and reporting of all program activities, to include the tracking of all envelopes and documents individually (and also associate each document with the envelope in which it arrived) during every part of the process from receipt of document to transmission of image files to the Government.

<DESC>The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) of the Department of Education intends to extend, on a sole source basis, contract number ED-06-CO-0027, for up to an additional five years.  The contractor is Accenture, LLP.  This contract will fulfill the need for requirements analysis, development, testing, operations, maintenance, technical support, and documentation in support of the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system.  COD supports the origination and disbursement of funds for the Direct Loan, Pell Grant, Academic Competitiveness Grant, National SMART Grant, and effective July 1, 2008, TEACH Grant programs to post-secondary schools and students.  FSA believes that Accenture is the only source possessing the necessary existing systems, information, resources, and expertise to meet the program requirements within the time required by FSA. The contract that FSA intends to extend with Accenture is necessary to continue services for the COD program until a Government owned or licensed system is in production.  It is anticipated that this replacement process could take up to six years.  Market research indicates that a minimum of two to four years is required to achieve system stability if a new system were to be acquired.  Based on Federal Student Aid's anticipated timeframe for system acquisition or replacement, it has been determined that competition for a new system is not practical at this time.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>1.	INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the U.S. Government. It was created in 1953 to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small businesses to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our Nation. In keeping with SBA?s purpose, SBA has entered into agreements with Small Business Lending Companies (SBLCs) and Non-Federally Regulated Lenders (NFLSs) (collectively, SBA Supervised Lenders) permitting them to make SBA-guaranteed 7(a) loans and microloans to small businesses. SBLCs are non-depository lenders which are generally not subject to oversight and examination by a Federal Financial Institution Regulator. Under 15 U.S.C. ?634(b)(7), 15 U.S.C. ?634(b)(14), 15 U.S.C. ?650, 15 U.S.C. ?636(a)(31), 13 C.F.R. ?414, 13 C.F.R. ?120.470, and SBA SOP 51 00 ?On-Site Lender Reviews/Examinations,? as amended, SBA supervises, examines, regulates and enforces laws against SBLCs and NFRLs. Additionally, under the authority of 13 C.F.R. ?120.475, as amended, every SBLC is subject to periodic audits by the SBA?s Office of Inspector General.

The Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) administers SBA?s lender oversight program and supervises SBA Supervised Lenders. SBA is the primary regulator for SBLCs and conducts safety and soundness examinations of SBLCs. Because the level of supervision of NFRLs provided by state authorities varies widely from state to state, and because capitalization sources for NFRLs also vary widely, SBA has the authority to supplement state supervision with its own oversight and perform safety and soundness examinations of NFRLs.

SBA?s limited examination resources make it necessary for SBA to contract with an outside entity to perform these safety and soundness examinations. SBA currently has an External Agreement with the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) to perform these safety and soundness examination services. The current External Agreement expires September 30, 2008. 

2.	OBJECTIVE

As part of SBA?s continued lender oversight efforts, the Agency will obtain safety and soundness examination support for the SBA Supervised Lenders. SBA is seeking to use information gathered during the safety and soundness examinations of SBA Supervised Lenders as part of our overall lender oversight efforts. The objective of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek information about small businesses that are capable of providing these safety and soundness examination services.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Solicitation.  There is no solicitation document available at this time; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.  

3.	REQUIREMENTS
The vendor shall have the capability of providing safety and soundness examination services, which includes the ability to prepare an examination plan prior to the actual examination containing: 1) the scope of the on-site examination activities, 2)a list of the individual examiners (including the examiner?s technical competency) involved in the on-site examination process, and 3) an estimate of the projected overall costs, time and resources needed to complete the on-site examination report.

The vendor shall have the capability to prepare a report of examination for each SBA Supervised Lender examined. Such reports of examination should comply with the guidelines for examinations of SBA Supervised Lenders as outlined in SBA?s SOP 51 00.  The reports must: 

?	provide a clear, concise, and objective evaluation of the SBA Supervised Lender?s SBA program and portfolio performance as of a certain date; 
?	address each of the review components describing: 
1.	summary conclusions, 
2.	all weaknesses identified, 
3.	any additional weaknesses the vendor determines to be appropriate, and 
4.	recommendations for improvement and/or Corrective Action, as appropriate to the assessment assigned; 
?	disclose the current financial condition of the SBA Supervised Lender and identify causes and effects; 
?	support all findings by factual material contained in the examination work papers; 
?	determine the appropriate assessment category to recommend for the SBA Supervised Lender based on the onsite examination; and 
?	detail the substantive examination findings supporting the SBA Supervised Lender assessment and any recommendations for Corrective Action.

The vendor shall have demonstrated experience in the following five component areas: capital, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity. The vendor?s experience shall include individual loan file review as part of this safety and soundness examination process. The vendor must include a written explanation of its experience and capabilities in each of the component areas of the safety and soundness examination:
 
1) Capital 
	
SBA?s required capital structure for SBLCs is specified in 13 CFR ?120.470(b) and SOP 51 00.  State statutes specify minimum capital requirements for NFRLs.  The evaluation of capital focuses on the SBA Supervised Lender?s ability to provide for growth and to absorb loan and operating losses. Submissions from vendors should address experience and capability of evaluating commercial lenders in the following tasks:
 
?	Compliance with the regulatory minimums;
?	The level, composition or quality of capital;
?	Asset growth rate of a lender compared to capital growth rate of lender;
?	The threat posed by asset quality if allowance for loan losses is inadequate;
?	The impact on capital from earnings, dividends, or other distributions;
?	Any concerns raised by interest rate risk, off-balance-sheet exposure, concentrations of credit, or any near-term commitments of capital; and
?	The adequacy of capital in relation to all pertinent ratios.

2) Asset Quality 
 
Business loans are generally the principal risk asset of an SBA Supervised Lender.  Accordingly, the analysis of small business loans will provide an asset quality conclusion that will impact the assessment of the SBA Supervised Lender, under 13 CFR ?120.410 and SOP 51 00 for 7(a) lenders and under13 CFR ?120.470(b) and SOP 51 00 for SBLCs.  Submissions from vendors should address experience and capability of evaluating commercial lenders in the following tasks:

?	The level and severity of criticized and classified business loans, and delinquency, workout, and non-accruals trends; 
?	Adequacy of loan portfolio management, including strategic planning, policy and procedure, internal loan review, stress testing, and compliance;
?	The adequacy of the loss allowance and capital in relation to classified and criticized loans;
?	Concentrations in industries or geographic regions that are suffering some economic distress; and
?	History or track record of i) meeting underwriting standards, ii) quality of credit administration, iii) adequacy of internal loan review, and iv) the timeliness of charge-offs.

3) Management

The assessment of management must consider every operational area in addition to the policies and standards adopted.  The assessment of management should cover both the board of directors and executive management, in accordance with 13 CFR ?120.410 and SOP 51 00 for all 7(a) Lenders and also 13 CFR ?120.470(b)(12) and SOP 51 00 for SBLCs. Submissions from vendors should address experience and capability of evaluating commercial lenders in the following tasks:
 
?	Effectiveness of policies, standards, and procedures;
?	Adequacy of internal controls, including internal loan review;
?	Ability to plan strategically and operationally, and to respond to changing circumstances;
?	The overall condition of the company, to the extent it can be attributed to policy or ineffective response to poor performance;
?	Pending litigation;
?	Compliance with law and regulations; and
?	Demonstrated competence, leadership, and administrative ability.

4) Earnings

Earnings are evaluated based on their quantity and quality, and the SBA Supervised Lender?s ability to sustain both.  In assessing the SBA Supervised Lender?s earnings, examiners must consider 13 CFR ?120.410 and SOP 51 00 for all 7(a) lenders and 13 CFR ?120.470(b) and SOP 51 00 for SBLCs. Submissions from vendors should address experience and capability in assessing a commercial lender?s earnings in the following areas:

?	The level of earnings compared to the company?s established goal;
?	Dividend expectations; 
?	Composition (quality) of net income;
?	Sustainability of earnings as indicated by interest rate risk and the volume and trend of non-accrual loans;
?	The relationship between the level of earnings and capital growth needs; and
?	Adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
 
5) Liquidity

An SBA Supervised Lender?s liquidity is evaluated on its capacity to promptly meet the demand for payment from its obligations and to readily meet the credit needs of borrowers in its territory, in accordance with 13 CFR ?120.410 and SOP 51 00 for all 7(a) lenders and also 13 CFR ?120.470(b)(12) and SOP 51 00 for SBLCs.  Submissions from vendors should address experience and capability in assessing a commercial lender?s liquidity in the following areas:

?	The existence of a parent company committed to providing the necessary liquidity to its subsidiary; 
?	The availability and cost of funding which is usually dictated by the overall condition of the company;
?	Any loans available for pooling and available for sale;
?	Loan demand;
?	The stability of the principal source of funding; and
?	Any near term capital expenditures, cash dividend, or unexpected liquidity demands. 

Finally, in addition to the safety and soundness examination reports, the vendor shall prepare a comprehensive summary report for each examination period (fiscal year), based upon final on-site examination reports, which will include conclusions and recommendations for changes in areas such as training,          SOP 51 00, examination methodology and oversight policy. In connection with the comprehensive summary reports, the vendor will (a) present an evaluation of weaknesses and adverse trends of the SBA Supervised Lenders as a whole; and (b) assist SBA in developing SBA Supervised Lender examination policies and procedures as requested by SBA.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR>---------------<BR>A.	 General Information<BR>The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Silver Dressing products.  This product line consists primarily of products with sizes doc umented in Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process of this announcement.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred  product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U . S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik, 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health  Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U. S. Army CENTCOM.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor prog ram executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional  information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3)  12-month option periods for a maximum of 5 years.  Anticipated selection date is May 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are cons idered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.  The selection of a s ingle vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, phone: 011-49-6221-172109, and e-mail marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil<BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required<BR><BR>The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the cat egory of Silver Dressings, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.   Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $354,967.00.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.<BR><BR>The top high volume usage line for this project is Silver Dressings in various sizes: 5x12, 1x24, 4x66, 16x16, 4x5, 4x8, 24x24, 8x16, 10x12, and 6x108. (All sizes noted above are expressed in inches unless otherwise identified.)  Th e top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company criteria below.  <BR><BR>At the request of the Europe Region MTFs, vendors wil l provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging info rmation of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors<BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number , and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us,.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participation.<BR><BR>This proce ss will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from networ k security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Europe Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) v ia e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria<BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board  (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<BR><BR>The Europe Region in tends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors  best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Europe Region may limit the  number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process:  Interested vendors will respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to th e above POC by the required response date.  Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated  below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.    After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who  meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the  business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services  submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items  (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor (PV) for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will b e disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factua lly correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	At a minimum your compa ny must manufacture or distribute Silver Dressings in the following sizes: 5x12, 1x24, 4x66, 16x16, 4x5, 4x8, 24x24, 8x16, 10x12, and 6x108.  All sizes are expressed in inches unless otherwise identified.  <BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the proce ss of applying for a DAPA number for the Silver Dressing product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will  be disqualified.) Your DAPA number is: __________________.  <BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the PV (currently, Europes PV is Owens & Minor) for distribution in the Europe Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available thr ough the regional PV will be disqualified.) <BR>4.	Vendors must offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note that vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.) <BR>5.	Vendors must pro vide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Your company must be able to send samples to this region by United States Postal Service (USPS).  This form of  mailing has proven to be the best at eliminating delays due to International Customs.   <BR>7.	Vendor must be able to ship samples necessary for evaluation via United States Parcel Service eliminating delays that occur with Europes Custom Offices.  Provi de acknowledgement of this requirement with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for their Silver Dressing products including dates, duration, cause , and resolution with their initial submittals.  Your company must provide history of back orders and/or recalls for the Silver Dressing products, which will include: dates, duration, cause, and resolution (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>9.	For any Silver Dre ssing products containing medication, vendors must provide products with FDA approval for use in all clinical advanced wound care settings and provide literature to support this requirement (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>10.	Vendors must provide a statement revealing all products containing synthesized polymer (plastic/rubber) clearly labeled as latex free/safe.<BR>11.	Vendors must supply a statement demonstrating instructions/directions for use with each unit of issue and provide evidence of this with thei r initial submittals.<BR>12.	Vendors must provide a statement confirming evidence that products can be delivered to a sterile field with (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR>13.	Your company is required to provide literature support showing the mechanism that ensu res normal bacteria of the wound and the promotion of wound healing.<BR>14.	Vendors must provide visual examples demonstrating product labels with visible expiration dates of at least 12 pt fonts on all exterior, intermediate and individual packaging and p rovide evidence of such (WITH INITIAL SUBMITTAL).<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process:  The multi-disciplinary CPT formed by the TPRB will r equest literature and/or samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment facilities.  The CPT will evaluate the product line using both a literature review and hands on evaluation in a non-clinical setting.   As indicated in the technical/company criteria above, vendors are required to ship samples to the Europe Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) via United States Parcel Service (USPS) to the following APO address:<BR>Commander, Europe Regional Medic al Command<BR>Attn: G-4 TriService Standardization<BR>Mr. Rob Halliday, (DSN 371-2108)<BR>CMR 442<BR>APO AE 09042<BR>Literature will be e-mailed or shipped via the same procedure as samples.  Vendors will be given 10 calendar days to ship samples.  Literat ure and samples must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 4:00PM EST on the 10th calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward verification (e-mail) of shipment to the TRBO.<BR><BR>Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  One (1) is equal to not acceptable, two (2) is equal to minimally acceptable, three (3) is equal to acceptable, four (4) is equal to most acceptable, and five (5) is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the clinically acceptability of produc ts for standardization.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.00 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.00.  Subject to this review, products b elow this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.   <BR> <BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the product s based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in an inpatient setting, if needed.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Perf ormance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.00  <BR><BR>Silver Dressings:<BR>1.	Dressing may be cut to required size.<BR>2.	Dressing does not cause a local advers e reaction.<BR>3.	Skin remains intact when dressing is removed.<BR>4.	The literature displays the requirement that the dressing is an effective barrier against a wide range of microbes.<BR><BR>Market Search Request for Information:  Our clinicians are atte mpting to stay abreast of technological advances in this product line.  None of the information provided based on the following feedback will be used to determine technical or clinical acceptability. Please describe any features that your products possess that use new design or technology.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process:  After the clinical/performance evaluations is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold (depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold as determined by the CPT) will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes as well as product cross-reference data based on a committed volume  of 80% of the total  Europe Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided ten (10) calendar days to submit their price quotes in the prescribed format as above via email.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the 10th calendar day.  Failure t o respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further partic ipation in this RIA initiative. The Europe Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, without discussions as noted above.  However, the Europe Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determine d to be necessary.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based o n best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  1) Impact of RIA prices on the Europe Region (Post-Standardization Costs), 2) Potential Cost Avoidance, 3) Impact of unmatched lines, and 4) Consideration of stock keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on  the Europe Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.<BR>

Commercial Drivers Pre-Employment Screening Program 
Market Research Information Conference 
May 06, 2008
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) will host a Market Research Information Session for its Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) for motor carriers on May 06, 2008, 10:00 ? 12:00, at the Department of Transportation Headquarters, Conference Center, Oklahoma Room, 1200 New Jersey Ave SE, Washington DC 20590. FMCSA is seeking information from sources providing data processing management technology services. This notice is pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10.0002 (Market Research). 
 
THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This conference is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of Market Research Information Conference attendance. The conference is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids and proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive contract.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no solicitation regarding this announcement is available.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the FEDBIZOPPS.  It is the potential sources? responsibility to monitor the FEDBIZOPPS site for release of any solicitation or synopsis resulting from the conference.
 
The FMCSA will provide an overview of the Pre-Employment Screening Program during the conference.  Specifically, FMCSA is interested in learning more about industry technology and capabilities for data warehousing capacity to manage a national clearinghouse for pre-employment screening of prospective commercial drivers. 

Section 4117 ?Safety performance history screening? of  the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFTEA-LU), signed by President George W. Bush on August 10, 2005, requires the FMCSA to provide companies conducting pre-employment screening services for motor carriers and employers access to crash and inspection data in FMCSA?s Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS).  

According to SAFTEA-LU, FMCSA is required to obtain consent from drivers before their crash and inspection history is released to employers of drivers in the commercial motor carrier industry.  Since the crash and inspection data contains personal information, FMCSA must follow laws and requirements for handling, storage, use, and dissemination of the data to protect the drivers.  In addition, FMCSA is responsible for creating a system to allow drivers to challenge erroneous data in their driver history, which currently exists through FMCSA?s Data Q?s program. There will be more information on the Data Q?s program at the Market Research Information Conference.

Motor carriers that hire commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers have legal and practical reasons to examine the employment history of potential employees. Safety, asset protection, and business reputations are concerns of both the carriers and the public. A driver?s crash and inspection record contains information that factors into hiring decisions.  This information on CMV drivers is collected, assembled, and maintained, in many different ways, by many different parties.  In response to the demand by carriers for this information, commercial operations have arisen to collect information on CMV drivers? histories, centralize that information in proprietary databases, and provide this information to carriers. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is considering evaluating current industry practices on pre-employment practices and possibly developing options for revising the way CMV driver records are maintained and made available to carriers.   

Participation is open to all interested parties. Registration shall be via email to Vinton Grant at Vinton.grant@dot.gov no later than April 16, 2008. Since the DOT HQ building is a secure facility, the government cannot guarantee admittance into the conference for interested parties who do not comply with the registration requirements by the established deadline.

<DESC>1. The proposed work will structurally prune and shape palm trees fronds along Las Lomas Dr. near single family housing complex to promote proper health and growth and to eliminate safety concerns. Currently, palm trees have been allowed to grow over roofs, power and phone lines, into backyards and over sidewalks and streets, creating an unsafe and hazardous condition for the residents of military housing and their personal property. Work is needed to prevent possible damage to government or personal property, or worse, personal injury. In addition, the fronds are dying, creating additional problems and concerns since the loose fronds may not withstand any type of high winds or storms. 
2. The contractor shall repair any damage to the surrounding area caused by the removal operation. Surrounding area includes but not limited to: house structure, lawn, sidewalks, paved areas, utilities and/or telephone lines, and resident's property.
3. Contractor shall prune/trim a total of fifty-four palm trees.
4. Contractor shall perform prunning/trimming as per industry standard to maintain the health and proper growth of the tree.
5. Contractor shall not pull or rip off fronds. Permanent wounds to the trunk can occur allowing for fungus or rot invasion and produces everenlarging holes in the trunk.

Name Brand Justification for RM Young Wind Monitors 

The RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are the standard wind monitoring sensors used at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast below the Mason-Dixon Line, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and throughout the Pacific.  Implementing different sensors in place of the current sensors will result in additional cost and resources.  Also, there will be resulting delay for testing, training, and purchase of support equipment.      

Under the current CO-OPS operating system any environmental monitoring sensor that has not been previously approved must be subjected to a series of tests to ensure the quality of the data produced by that sensor and the durability of that sensor for the intended use.  These tests usually include bench testing using controlled conditions and physical measurement, controlled environmental testing to check a sensor?s reliability under different conditions, and long term comparison testing with accepted sensors at multiple real world locations.  These tests and the analysis of the resulting data take a large amount of time, money, and resources to conduct. 

These RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors are tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and are replacements in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of where they are positioned on piers, buoys, etc.

CO-OPS stations are designed for optimal performance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors.  A change of sensor type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new sensor. 

CO-OPS cannot risk the possibility of new mounting hardware to be developed and purchased to mount a new sensor.

The data collection platforms at CO-OPS stations are programmed to collect data from the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors.  If a new sensor is implemented additional cost for software development will be required.  

Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors.  Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new sensor. 

Using another type of sensor will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple sensor types in a given region.

CO-OPS also has the ability and necessary equipment to calibrate and repair the RM Young Models 05103 and 05103-45 Wind Monitors.  If a new sensor is implemented new equipment for that sensor will need to be purchased and training will be needed for those tasked with this duty.

Name Brand Justification for RM Young Multi-Plate Solar Radiation and Precipitation Shields

The RM Young Multi-Plate Solar Radiation and Precipitation Shield Model 41003 is the standard shield used for air temperature and relative humidity sensors at CO-OPS environmental monitoring stations on the Atlantic coast, the Gulf of Mexico, throughout the Pacific, the Great Lakes, the Caribbean, and in Alaska.  Implementing a different shield in place of the current one will result in the need for additional costs and resources. 

The RM Young Multi-Plate Solar Radiation and Precipitation Shield Model 41003 is tied to a series of data collection software and existing infrastructure and is a replacement in kind due to a high consumable rate as a result of its position on piers, buoys, etc.

CO-OPS stations are designed for the use of the RM Young Model 41003 shield.  A change of shield type will result in a need to redesign the existing stations to accommodate the new shield for optimal performance of the sensor it houses. 

New mounting hardware will need to be developed and purchased to mount a new type of shield.

Currently CO-OPS field personal and contractors are trained in the use and maintenance of the RM Young Model 41003 shield.  Additional cost will incur from having to train field personal and contractors on the use and maintenance of a new shield. 

Using another type of shield will require the purchase of additional equipment so that the field crews can support multiple types of shields in a given region.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.   OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:     solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

FDA will award a purchase order to a responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest price meeting or exceeding the required technical factors.  In order to be considered for award the vendor must submit with their quote documentation supporting that their product meets the following technical factors and sub factors:

Technical Factors: 

1. Provide a GUI to manipulate input data to send to web service.
2. Provide ability to save and reuse multiple test cases and data sets (i.e. csv, xls, database) for regression testing.
3. Supports complete test workflow from simple single service tests to complex scenarios and multiple service endpoints. 
4. Data-driven testing through data sources (Excel, CSV, Database Queries, etc). 
5. Provide ability to collect and report testing metrics.
6. Provide ability to view, modify and verify SOAP request and response messages in real time.
7. Provide ability to validate XML Schema and WSDL.
8. Provide ability to efficiently debug and unit test code in development phase as well.
9. Provide ease of adapting testing requirements to changing web service standards and protocols.
10. Provide ability to emulate completes business processes through chaining multiple web service calls.
11. Provides ability for functional, regression, performance, load, interoperability and vulnerability testing.
12. Must be compliant with section 508 standards: 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31 and 1194.41.

Technical Sub Factors:

1. Can be pointed at a WSDL; the tool will crawl it and build a set of positive and negative tests for each Web method on the WSDL, resulting in quicker and further progress of the testing effort from the very beginning of the testing process.  
2. The tool's auto-generated tests, are instantly executable and are actual tests, rather than empty test skeletons. Each test node in the tool's explorer is accompanied by a "traffic object" subnode that retains the most recent request/response pair generated by that test. So you can execute a test, then click on the traffic object to examine the exact exchange.
3. Tool provides for a quick and easy manipulation of project-wide behavior. 
4. The tool allows users to trace the execution of Java applications at the JVM level (without a need to change any code or to recompile), and in the context of a larger integrated system. In addition, the tool increases efficiencies in evolving the system functionality with little or no regression testing  by executing existing test case scenarios while the business application is being traced, and then establishes a snapshot of the current functionality to serve as a regression baseline for these scenarios.

Delivery of the product will be FOB destination. The contractor shall deliver the product to 5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN RM9B45 HFC-32, Rockville, MD 20857 no later than seven days after receipt of a purchase order.
