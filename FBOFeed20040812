The solicitation should be posted no later than August 17, 2004. The period of performance for this work will be from date of award for one year and will include four option years based on phases with a limit of 5 years. All proposals will be evaluated and considered, however, please note that work requires knowledge and use of thermo-regulated density gradient columns.  Also there are few researchers that have permitss issued for reserach on the fish speciies of interest, including but not limited to Pecos Bluntnose Shiner and other Minnows. Submit proposals to the Bureau of Reclamation, UC-820, 125 S. State Street, Salt Lake City, UT 84138. Brief Description of Work:  Research will be conducted to more precisely and accurately determine the specific gravity for one or more of the cyprinid species.  These specieis include Hybognathus placitus, Notropis simus, Notropis girardi, Notropis Jemezanus, and Macrhybopis aestivalis.  Phase I of the project will determine specific gravity for Hybognathus placitus and Notropis simus eggs.  Phase II of project may determine specific gravity for Noptropis girardi and Notropis jemezanus eggs if funding is available and continuation of the project is justified.  Phase III of project may determine specific gravity for Macrhybopsis aestivalis eggs if funding is available and continuation of the project is justified.  Quarterly and annual progess reports to document the work completed will be required. The point of contact for the procurement will be Pat Postell at the Bureau of Reclamation, 125 S.

<ARCHDATE>08122005
<CONTACT>Terry K. Ford, Jr. Contracting Officer 2083785399     tford@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Request for Quotations (RFQ) Number 04SQ108230, for commercial items (appraisal services), prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice (the text of FAR paragraphs referenced herein may be found at www.arnet.gov/far) . This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, "Instructions to Offerors-Commercial," apply to this acquisition.  This is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 541990 and the size standard is $6 million average annual receipts for the past 3 years. Due to the creation of the Appraisal Services Directorate (ASD) within the Department of the Interior (DOT), and the expiration of numerous existing separate DOT agency appraisal contracts within the next year, new contractual arrangements are needed. The Pacific Northwest Region of the Bureau of Reclamation has been asked to initiate multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified appraisers throughout the Pacific Northwest for use by the ASD in supporting various appraisal needs of DOI agencies (Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Bureau of Reclamation) located in the states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and Idaho over the next 5 years. Start date for the BPAs is proposed to be October 1, 2004, and the term of the BPAs will be 5 years. We envision entering into as many as several dozen BPAs. All interested appraisers are invited to submit proposals for consideration and award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor are appraisers obligated to accept any orders. For each appraisal assignment, a statement of work (SOW) will be provided and the Government will request a price proposal from one or more of the appraisers that have been awarded BPAs. (Appraisers can view and download a copy of the form which will be used to submit the price proposal at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/forms/index.html.  Click on "Appraisal Price Proposal Form.")  Individual task order proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to on the BPAs. Government personnel authorized to place task orders under the BPAs will be identified on the BPAs by name and telephone number.  The appraiser will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of BPAs, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the SOW that accompanies the request for a price proposal.   The appraisals are to be used for a variety of purposes: fee and easement acquisition, land exchanges, public sales, leases, licenses, permits, and other types of real estate management cases. The majority of lands to be appraised will be rural in character, typically: timberland, recreation, grazing, agriculture, transitional, and rural residential. Occasionally lands with urban, industrial, or commercial uses will also be appraised. Improvements are sometimes present. Appraisal assignments may be required for either single or multiple tracts. Appraisers shall be certified in accordance with Title XL of Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) in the states where services are to be provided, and shall comply with all state regulations pertaining to real estate appraisal services. Prospective appraisers shall have been general state-certified for a minimum of 3 years. The appraiser shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, personnel, facilities, transportation, travel and per diem, unless otherwise noted. The Government will provide the SOW and (as available) maps, legal description, estate to be appraised, preliminary title report, hazardous material report, mineral report, landowner information, and the official name and tract number. The use of services of specialists such as, but not limited to, engineers, foresters, biologists, geologists, and so forth, for the completion of a specific appraisal must be identified in the appraiser's price proposal at the time of submission to the Government. The use of such specialists (and the specialists themselves) during the assignment for any BPA task order must be approved in advance by the ASD representative and the Contracting Officer (CO). All appraisals shall conform to the most recent and applicable editions of the "Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice" (USPAP) and the "Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions" (UASFLA) requirements, unless other directions are given in the SOW for a specific appraisal assignment. State, Federal, or local agencies may require vehicles to be steam-cleaned or washed with high-pressure water to remove all soil and organic matter, to minimize invasive species contamination, before entering public lands. This may also be required by private land owners.  The property owner, or designated representative, and the ASD representative shall be given a minimum 5 working day advance notice with an offer to accompany the appraiser on an inspection of the property. Such notification shall be documented in the appraisal report.  FAR paragraphs 52.212-2, "Evaluation-Commercial Items," and 52.212-4, "Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items," apply to this solicitation. Evaluation criteria to be used to determine whether to enter into a BPA with an appraiser are the appraiser's technical capability, past performance, and prices.  FAR paragraph 52.212-5, "Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order -Commercial Items," also applies to this acquisition; the following FAR clauses listed therein, in subparagraph (b), are included by reference: 52.222-6; 52.222-21, 52.222-26, and 52.222-36 (applicable to task orders that exceed $10,000); 52.222-35 and 52.222-37 (applicable to task orders that exceed $25,000); and 52.222-33. All appraisers must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be awarded a BPA. (You may register easily and quickly on-line at www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.)   Quote Submission Instructions - Appraisers wishing to enter into a BPA shall submit the following: A. Identify and provide qualification information for key personnel (and any regularly and frequently used subcontractors) expected to participate in the work under your BPA. Indicate relevant education, experience, capability, and expert witness experience of such personnel. List appraisal courses taken and professional memberships, if any, in appraisal organizations. Submit copies of licenses and/or certificates. (Substitutions or additions to the list of key personnel or subcontractors during the contract period must be approved by the ASD and the CO.) B. Provide two sample appraisal reports that are standard work products (not demonstration or modified reports).  These samples should be reflective of the property types indicated in paragraph I. below, "Property Types and Realty Interests," and should meet the USPAP, and preferably the UASFLA. The reports provided must have been completed by personnel that are identified as key personnel in the proposal and are expected to be identified as key personnel for a specific appraisal. Sample appraisals completed within the last 3 years are preferable.   C.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs requires contract support for its' Telecommunications Modernization Project (TMP) to optimize its existing telecommunications services into a national integrated services platform.  The TMP will provide a state-of-the-art telecommunications infrastructure that will improve telecommunications performance, while providing consistent levels of service across all VA business lines, at competitive prices.  The TMP is based on the use of the FTS2001 contract vehicle as the basis of service delivery to VA business lines.  The TMP recognizes that the current VA telecommunications services management approach no longer meets the needs of their constantly changing and expanding environment.  Furthermore, the VA believes that accountability for telecommunications costs is needed to meet the requirements of the VA Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the National Performance Review (NPR), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory board (FASAB).  In order to set the stage for future investments in telecommunications technologies and to provide the level of support service required to VA customers, the VA must manage existing telecommunications assets more effectively before further investments are made. Therefore, the VA has decided to acquire an enterprise-wide, state-of-the-art Telecommunications Operations Support System to ensure that telecommunications infrastructure supports established business needs including: The ability to manage telecommunications assets; better service order management; improved telecommunications expense management; recommendations for optimizing services and assets; circuit provisioning and engineering; reporting capabilities and user training.  RFP 101-38-04 will be available via intent by August 27, 2004 for download.  NAICS number is 517910.  The RFP will only be available for download on the web.

<CONTACT>Kristen Eaves, Contract Administrator, Phone 256-895-4056, Fax 256-895-5898, Email kristen.eaves@gsa.gov
<DESC>1	Scope.

This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the requirements for developing personnel in the Systems Definition Branch (N641) into systems analyst capable of performing systems engineering tasks from requirements development to acceptance testing. The Systems Integration Division (N64) is the central development agency for web services implementation for FORCENET NAVOCEANO. This is a new technology for N64, and the roles, interactions and responsible work products required by each branch within the division need to be analyzed and clearly defined.  The use of a new technology as well as the changing role of N64 has created a gap in the knowledge and skill sets required by personnel within N641. This group must now interface with subject matter experts from other NAVOCEANO codes and be able to translate requirements into work products needed by N64 developers.

2	Requirements.

2.1  N64 CONOPS. 

The contractor shall facilitate development of a N64 concept of operations (CONOPS) that describes the roles, responsibilities and the work products required by each branch within N64.

2.1.1   Contractor Responsibility.

•	Facilitate a meeting involving key stakeholders to:
&#61662;	  Define an updated set of roles and responsibilities for each branch;
&#61662;	  Identify specific skill sets needed by N641 to carry out those roles and responsibilities;
&#61662;	  Perform a gap analysis between the “as is” and the “to be” state with the focus on N641.

2.1.2  Government Responsibility.

•	 Write a CONOPS for N64 that justifies the new skills required by N641 and provide a copy to the contractor for evaluation and feedback.

2.2  Curriculum Design.

The contractor shall design a curriculum that fills the gaps in the skill set and knowledge requirements for N641 to operate effectively and efficiently in the “to be” state. This curriculum must span the whole systems engineering lifecycle activities that N641 is responsible for. It should also address the interface activities between N641 and the developers required communicating the system conceptual view and identifying impacts to the system architecture. 

2.2.1  Instructor Responsibility.

•	Provide advance copy of the curriculum for review and approval by the government.
•	Recommend a training schedule.
•	Incorporate curriculum and schedule changes based on government feedback.

2.2.2  Government Responsibility.

•	Review the recommended curriculum and schedule, and provide feedback to the contractor within 5 working days

2.3  Execute Curriculum.

The contractor shall deliver the training curriculum in accordance with the agreed upon schedule.



3.0	Invoices and Payment

The contractor shall propose a deliverable and payment schedule for this requirement.  Copies of receipts, travel vouchers, etc., completed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations shall be attached to the invoice to support charges.  In addition, the contractor shall attach the deliverable acceptance form signed by the client representative.  Original receipts shall be maintained by the contractor and made available to Government auditors upon request.  

Invoices for final payment must be so identified and submitted when the task has been completed and no further charges are to be billed.

Payment of invoices will be made based upon acceptance by the Government that acceptable deliverables were provided.  Contractor’s are required to submit an electronic copy of each invoice through GSA electronic system after receipt of acceptance from the client representative or designated representative.  Contractor has the option of posting the invoice on GSA’s Ft. Worth web site or mail to the address below.  NOTE:  Only use one method of submission, web site or regular U.S. mail, but not both.

Mail your invoices to the following address:

GSA Accts Payable Br (7BCP)
299X
P.O. Box 17181, Fund 299X
Fort Worth, TX 76102-0181

4.0	PERSONAL SERVICES.  GSA meets the needs of its clients for information technology support through non-personal services contracts.  To counter the circumstances that infer personal services and to preserve the non- personal nature of the contract, the contractor shall adhere to the following guidelines in the performance of the task:

4.1 Provide for direct supervision of all contract employees assigned to the task.

4.2 Refrain from discussing the issues such as skill levels and hours, salaries, cost and funding data, or administrative and personnel matters affecting contractor employees with the client.

4.3 Ensure close communication/coordination with the GSA CSR, reporting problems to the CSR as they occur (not waiting for a monthly meeting).

4.4 Do not permit government officials to interview potential contractor employees, discuss individual performance, approve leave or work scheduling of contractor employees, terminate contractor employees, assist contractor employees in doing their jobs or obtain assistance from the contractor in doing Government job.

4.5 Do not assign contractor personnel to work under direct government supervision.

4.6 Maintain a professional distance from government employees.

4.7 Provide contractor employees with badges, if appropriate, identifying them as contractors.

4.8 Ensure proper communications with the government (technical discussion and government surveillance is okay, but the Government cannot tell the contractor how to do the job).

4.9 Assign a task leader to the task order. The task leader or alternate should be the only one who accepts tasking from the assigned Government point of contact or alternative.

4.10  The government has the right to reject the finished product or result and this does not constitute personal services.

4.11 When travel is required for the performance on a task, the contractor personnel are only to travel as directed by their contract management.

This announcement constitutes sole source solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued in accordance with Note 2. 701814Q052 is issued as a sole source request for quotation. This acquisition and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 The new updated  Dream Closed Circuit Television System (CCTV)  will be purchased from Guardian Security, 2600 Seward Highway, Anchorage, AK 99503 due to Guardian Security had previously won the bid to install the existing CCTV system in 1997 and this system will be an upgrade to the current system maintained by Guardian.  Guardian, in the past, has also installed an upgrade to add viewing of remote cameras at the guard station and has upgraded the system to 4-channel digital recorder capability. Most important, they are completely familiar with the existing wiring, wiring routes, panels etc.  Rebidding this out would be considered fruitless in that labor alone to reroute wiring and/or install new wiring and paneling to operate a different system would be much more than Guardian could complete this project for. Guardian is utilizing the same paneling and wiring routes and wiring they have initially put in place in 1997 to install this upgraded system but is also installing two new outside remote controlled PTZ cameras and two controllers in the building.  In that Guardian outbid the local competitors in 1997 and is completely familiar with the building currently occupied by US Fish & Wildlife at 1011 East Tudor Road, Anchorage, AK 99503, US Fish & Wildlife Service has determined that this be a sole source. Delivery, inspection and acceptance will be at US Fish & Wildlife Service, 1011 East Tudor Rd, Anchorage, AK 99503 on or before 093004. The following provisions 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial items apply to this acquisition.

C.1 BACKGROUND  Under the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Amendments of 1992, which make employment standards established under Title 1 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, applicable to Federal employment under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, Federal Agencies are required to make “reasonable accommodations” to the known employees with physical or mental disabilities, former employees and applicants.  The Headquarters of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) has approximately 3,000 employees and customers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  Approximately 30 employees use sign language and require interpreter services routinely or for specific events.  C.2 SCOPE   The contractor(s) shall provide one (1) full-time interpreter, two (2) part-time interpreters, and ad hoc interpreters as required for interpreter requests from the applicants, employees, family members, and customers of the agencies and organizations serviced by the DLA EEO office. The majority of assignments shall be located at the Headquarters of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) located in the McNamara Complex at Ft. Belvoir, Virginia; however, some assignments shall be off-post, in the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) modular building located in the McNamara Complex parking lot or at designated locations within the Washington metropolitan area.  Attachment J.1 is a map of Fort Belvoir North Post and directions to the McNamara Complex facility.

The interpreter assigned full-time must report to the COR if the federal employee requiring full-time interpreter services does not report to work, comes in late, or leaves work early on any given business day.  The interpreter will not exceed 37.5 hours per week (which does not include 30 minutes for lunch).  The interpreter will work Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (factoring in a 30 minute unpaid lunch period) and provide interpreting services as assigned by the COR or the designated alternate interpreting services coordinators.  C.3.3 The contractor(s) shall provide two part-time, preferably NAD Level IV and/or RID CSC certified, interpreters.  The interpreters will report to the COR or the designated alternate interpreting services coordinators at the DOS office, Room 1119, McNamara Complex, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and be located at the DLA EEO office when not on an assignment.  Each interpreter will not exceed 18 hours per week (which does not include 30 minutes for lunch). Each interpreter will work Tuesday through Thursday from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The COR has the right to change the days of the week the interpreters are routinely scheduled to work, based on requirement, with a five calendar day notice.  C.3.4 The COR or the part-time interpreters may be responsible for coordinating and scheduling interpreter requests.  When ad hoc services are required, approval must be obtained from the COR before being coordinated and scheduled with the contractor by the part-time interpreters. The COR or the part-time interpreters shall contact the contractor(s) via e-mail, facsimile, web and/or telephone with requests for, changes to, or cancellations of interpreter services.  The COR or part-time interpreters will provide pertinent information related to the assignment (date, time, projected length of assignment, type of assignment, location, employee’s name requiring the service, two (2) point of contacts (POC) for the request, their respective telephone numbers, sign language preference and copies of speeches, documents or training material that will be used during the event prior to the event if possible.)  Requests shall be made by the COR or part-time interpreters at a minimum of two (2) business days (Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) prior to the assignment. Occasions may occur where the COR or part-time interpreters are unable to provide the required two (2) business days notice.  The contractor(s) shall have right to refuse an assignment when less than two business days notice is given.  The contractor(s)’ refusal must be given within two (2) hours of the time the request was placed during DLA’s business days.  If the contractor(s) accepts the request the agency shall be billed at the hourly rate established.  No special rates shall be used for requests placed with less than two (2) business day’s notice.  The contractor(s) shall provide the COR the name(s) of the interpreter(s) and the level of the interpreter’s certification, if requested, at a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours prior to the assignment.

C.3.4.2 The contractor shall provide to the Defense Logistics Agency for review and approval a web based scheduling tool to coordinate all DLA interpreter service requests with the contractor(s).  In addition to interpreting, scheduling and coordinating interpreting services will be a duty of the two (2) part-time interpreters with COR oversight. C.3.4.3 The part-time interpreters will be responsible for picking-up ad hoc or alternate interpreters at the security desk and escorting them to their respective assignments when available and necessary.  C.3.5 Ad Hoc Interpreters: The contractor(s) shall provide additional interpreters for any ad hoc requirements lasting two (2) to eight (8) hours in duration that cannot be covered by the full-time and/or part-time interpreters, preferably NAD Level IV and/or RID CSC certified, as required at the designated location within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. See C.3.4 for how ad hoc interpreters will be scheduled.  C.4 QUALIFICATIONS OF INTERPRETERS.  All interpreters should have a National Association of the Deaf (NAD) Level III (Generalist), Level IV (Advanced), or Level V Master) certification and/or a Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) Comprehensive Skills Certification (CSC).  If the contractor does not provide interpreters with these certifications then the interpreters provided must be approved by a cross section of DLA’s employees who are deaf or hard of hearing.  All interpreters shall conduct themselves according to the NAD and/or RID code of ethics. C.4.1 All full-time and part-time interpreters who are routinely in the building a minimum of three (3) business days are required to be able to obtain and keep a DLA contractor’s clearance, which requires a completed and favorably adjudicated National Agency Check with written inquiries (NACI). If DLA denies or withdraws an interpreter’s clearance, the contractor(s) will be required to supply the agency with another interpreter within 72 continuous hours. C.5 NUMBER OF INTERPRETERS REQUIRED.  The number of interpreters required is subject to the approval of the COR.

All interpreters must have a photo ID that is accepted by the DLA Security Office, for example a valid driver’s license, to enter the McNamara Complex and any of its grounds or buildings. Interpreters shall arrive not later than thirty (30) minutes prior to a scheduled assignment regardless of where the assignment is located.  At the DLA McNamara Complex, interpreters shall arrive at the main entrance security desk not later than thirty (30) minutes prior to a scheduled assignment because sufficient time must be allocated by the interpreters for entrance into the McNamara Complex secured parking area and subsequent secured entrance into the McNamara Complex building.  Interpreters shall access the building through the main entrance.  Upon clearing security, if one of the two POCs is not at the security desk to escort the interpreters, the interpreters shall call both POCs provided to them prior to contacting the COR or the part-time interpreters to escort them to their assignment.  The contractor(s) shall not bill the agency for any of the time described in this paragraph.   C.7 NO DEAF EMPLOYEES ATTEND ASSIGNMENT.  If an ad hoc interpreter is on-site for a scheduled assignment open to a general audience and no one requiring interpreter services is in attendance, the interpreter shall contact the COR located in the DLA EEO office, Room 1119, McNamara Complex, Fort Belvoir, Virginia thirty (30) minutes after the start of the event.  The COR has the option to assign the interpreter to another request without an additional charge/cancellation fee with the stipulation that if the new assignment runs over the original number of hours of the scheduled assignment, the difference will be charged.  If the event is being video taped, the interpreter shall provide interpreting services whether or not there are people in attendance requiring interpreter services.    C. 7.1 If a part-time interpreter(s) is scheduled for an assignment open to the general audience that is not being video taped and no one requiring interpreter services is in attendance, the interpreter(s) must return to the DLA EEO office for another assignment.  C.8 LIBERAL LEAVE FOR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.  Full-time and part-time interpreters.  Report to work as usual. Ad hoc interpreters  If the federal government is on liberal leave, the ad hoc interpreters are responsible for calling the requesting organization’s POCs at the number provided on their assignment document or the COR at 703-767-6777 to determine if the assignment is still scheduled. If the event has been canceled, the contractor(s) may assess the cancellation fee for less than 24 continuous hours notice. C.9 CLOSURE OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER OR EMERGENCY.  Full time, part time and ad hoc interpreters.  Will not report to work if the federal government is closed due to inclement weather or emergency.  No cancellation fee or charges shall be assessed.  C10  OTHER UNSCHEDULED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CLOSURES.  In the event of an unscheduled closure of the federal government, the full-time, part-time or ad hoc interpreters will not report to work or to their scheduled assignments.  No cancellation fee or charges shall be assessed.  C.10.1 No interpreter services are required on federal holidays. C.11 INCLEMENT WEATHER – NON-CLOSURES.  In the event of severe inclement weather or an emergency, all interpreters (full-time, part-time, and ad hoc) are responsible for calling one or both of the requesting organization’s POCs at the numbers provided on their assignment document or the COR at 703-767-6777 to determine if the assignment is still scheduled. If the event has been canceled, the contractor(s) may assess the cancellation fee for less than 24 continuous hours notice. C.12 HOURLY RATE FOR SERVICES.  The hourly rate for services includes all travel expenses, evening assignments and weekend assignments. The contractor shall bill the agency using the flat rate established in the pricing schedule.  C.13 REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES – AD HOC INTERPRETER REQUESTS.  Regardless of assignment duration, the contractor(s) shall be reimbursed for a minimum of two (2) hours.  Assignments lasting more than two (2) hours shall be invoiced for the actual duration of the assignment not the estimated duration called in by the COR or part-time interpreters when coordinating and scheduling the request.  For billing purposes the contractor(s) shall round up to the nearest hour.  The contractor(s) shall bill in whole hour units only.  For example, if the COR or part-time interpreters coordinates and schedules a request for an assignment that is anticipated to last from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. but the assignment actually lasts from 8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., the contractor(s) shall bill the agency for four (4) hours of service (8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.).  If the assignment lasted from 8:00 a.m. to 11:15 a.m., the contractor(s) shall bill the agency for three (3) hours of service (8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.).  For assignments lasting more than eight (8) continuous hours, the contractor(s) shall be reimbursed at the rate of 1.5 times the hourly rate established in the Pricing Schedule for the portion of the assignment that exceeds 8 hours.  For example, if an assignment last ten (10) hours, the contractor(s) shall bill for eight (8) hours using the established hourly rate and two (2) hours at the hour rate multiplied by 1.5.        
C14 CANCELLATION OF ASSIGNMENT – AD HOC INTERPRETER REQUESTS. 
The COR or part-time interpreters shall notify the contractor(s) by e-mail, facsimile, web or telephone when an ad hoc interpreter assignment is canceled for reasons other than those listed under C9., C10., and C.ll.  C14.1 Assignments canceled less than or equal to twenty-four (24) continuous hours shall be reimbursed for a minimum of two (2) hours at the normal rate or one half the applicable hourly rate for the scheduled hours. Assignments canceled prior to twenty-four (24) continuous hours before the assignment shall not be reimbursed.  C.15 ASSIGNMENT LOG.   The COR and part-time interpreters shall maintain a log of the date an order was placed, the time the order was placed, the job number, the date of the assignment, the start time of the assignment, the anticipated duration and a description of the event for each assignment given to the contractor(s).  The log shall be made available to the contracting officer for inspection.

If for any reason not described in this SOW, the contractor(s) fails to fulfill an interpreter service request at the location and time required, the contractor(s) shall not charge the agency for the requested service and will provide the organization who requested the service one hour of free service the next time interpreting services are requested by that organization.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services IAW with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F6104004. The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The NAICS Code is 339111. 

The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to SciMarket Strategies, 318 West Emerson Street, Melrose, Massachusetts for evaluation of a Multianalyte Microarray System.  SciMarket is the only party capable of evaluating this new approach for measurement of many toxins simultaneously.  

Vendor shall perform the following statement of work: The Instrumentation and Biophysics Branch (IBB) is involved in research and development of new approaches and assays for the identification and detection of toxic substances in food.  Of particular concern are protein toxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxins, which may pose not only a food safety risk, but also a terrorism threat.  Among the many approaches that are being considered are multianalyte microarray systems and assays, which employ multiple antibodies to simultaneously extract and detect more than one toxin in a complex matrix.  Although there are many academic research efforts in this area, we would like to assess the capabilities of a commercial instrument based on the microarray approach.  This instrument is produced by SciMarket Strategies business partner, Zeptosens-AG and employs a fluorescence based microarray/assay system using Planar Waveguide Technology.  The approach undertaken by using the Zeptosens instrument is that it allows for the simultaneous detection of more than one toxin at part-per-million levels and lower, which are requirements for any such system the FDA would eventually employ. 

This is important new detection technology that may be capable of fulfilling long term needs for the agency in the broad areas of food safety and security.  Modifications of the current multianalyte assay, with input from the FDA (IBB), could address future needs. SciMarket Strategies has worked with Zeptosens using its system for studies on the multiplexed detection of food contaminants,but it has not yet developed specific assays for the target toxins in which the FDA is interested.  The FDA requires that a custom assay be developed and evaluated for toxins chosen by the FDA and in matrices of interest to the FDA.  Evaluation of the instrument with toxins and matrices of interest to the FDA, under FDA guidance, will be the most effective way to determine the efficacy of this approach.

The following are the requirements for the evaluation.
1) A simultaneous assay will be developed for the following toxins: staphylococcal enterotoxins A & B, E. coli shiga toxins type 1 & 2, cholera toxin, tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin and aflatoxin. 
2) The assay will be developed for use with three matrices: water (or buffered water), apple juice and milk. 3) SciMarket Strategies will deliver two reports as the product of this evaluation. The first (Phase I) report will describe the performance characteristics of the multianalyte array in water (or buffer). The second (Phase 2) report will be a final report detailing the performance of the multianalyte Assay for the toxins in two food matrices, milk and apple juice. 4) Requirements for Phase I report: a. microarray layout design;
b. test and select assay reagents; c. adjust individual assay dynamic ranges; d. test individual assay performance in aqueous buffer, milk and apple juice; e. provide a diagram describing sample preparation procedure; f. provide a diagram describing all analytical steps e.g. incubation, washing, addition of a reagent etc.; g. test multiplexed assay performance in aqueous buffer;
5. Methods for characterizing performance of assays described in part 4 above: a. Show calibration curve for analytes using analyte standard solutions in both, the buffer, milk and fresh apple juice; b.	Limit of detection (LOD) for the individual analytes determined according to the following  procedure:  prepare 10 independent sample blanks from whole fresh apple juice according to developed sample preparation procedure. Measure sample blanks once on the same day using identical analytical conditions by the same operator using the same equipment. Calculation of LOD: determine the mean blank value and standard deviation; calculate the concentration at signal level of the blank signal + 3 x standard deviation (blank) us-ing the calibration curve; c. Carry out analysis of analytes in model samples prepared by spiking of whole milk and apple juice (prepare fresh samples each measuring day); d. Calculate repeatability expressed as standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the individual analytes; e. Provide results of analysis (average and standard deviation); f. Report working range for assay; g. Report limit of quantification for assay
6. Requirements for Phase II report: a.	optimize multiplexed assay conditions (all analytes simultaneously measured); b.test performance and validate multiplexed assay in milk and apple juice samples; c. methods for characterizing performance of multiplexed array will be the same as those discussed in part 5; 
7. The FDA will supply SciMarket Strategies with all of the reagents associated with each assay, including the toxin itself and antibodies associated with the immunoaffinity capture of the toxin. Where it is more efficient for SciMarket Strategies to procure antibodies or toxins directly, FDA will provide appropriate sources. The FDA will provide all of the necessary procedure for use of the antibodies (surface binding, etc). The FDA will also provide data regarding the evaluation of standard ELISA based methods for the same toxin, e.g. the tests against which the multiarray methods will be evaluated.  

This is not a formal request for quotes. However, the evaluation of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis. The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  

The following FAR clauses shall apply to the solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. All questions should be submitted in writing via email to sharon.savage@fda.hhs.gov or fax to (301) 827-7039. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www.arnet.gov.

Solicitation Number:  FA8750-04-R-0281

Description:

Capable small businesses sources are sought to perform software research and development for the IFEB Division, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site (RRS), Rome NY.   AFRL RRS has a requirement to build on and extend the National Air and Space Intelligence Center’s (NASIC’s) current automated threat database production system, consisting of the Automated Intelligence Production Support System (AIPSS), the Knowledge Pre-positioning Production (KPS), Virtual Production System (VPS), Virtual Intelligence Production (VIP), and NASIC Metadata Repository (NMR).  The AIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP and NMR are components critical to this effort.  The design, development, implementation, and integration of new components with the AIPSS, KPS, VPS, VIP and NMR will provide the Information Technology (IT) solution to NASIC’s corporate objectives for prepositioning its analytical knowledge and for enabling customers and other intelligence analysts to build a custom and persistent product.  The effort will include the development and/or expansion of parametric information models; design of physical and logical database structures; development, implementation, and enhancement of the capability to interactively maintain data within the databases; implementation of the capabilities to derive tailored specialized products from the textual and parametric databases and multimedia object repositories; development of high level constructs that dynamically incorporate database information into indivisible groups of objects that answer customer questions; and the development and implementation of customer friendly tools and interfaces.  Further, this effort supports the development, enhancement and implementation of national level systems for the input, translation, and retrieval of all-source information and for the continued design, development, implementation and deployment of a DoD Intelligence Information System (DODIIS) wide information notification system.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.  A period of performance of 60 months is anticipated.  The prime contractor and system integrators for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances.  Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside.  Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the size standard for small business is 500 employees.  Respondents to this announcement should indicate whether they are a small business, 8(a) concern, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, or historically black college or university (HBCU) or minority institution (MI) (as defined by the clause at DFARS 252.226-7000).  As discussed at FAR 19.502-2(b)(2), in making R&D small business set-asides, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns and also a reasonable expectation of obtaining the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules.  The same considerations would apply to any HBCU/MI set-aside.  Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions and resources necessary to successfully compete for this award (See Number Note 25).  This information will assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.  Provide information on at least three (3) contracts for similar work within the past five (5) years.  Include complete references, contract titles, dollar values, points of contact and telephone numbers.  The Government will evaluate relevant experience information based on information provided by the Offeror.

(2) How many people does your company employ?  (3) How many TS/SCI cleared personnel are currently available?  4) Will you need to hire additional personnel to perform this effort?  (5) Is your company’s cost accounting system approved by DCAA or DCMC?  If not, how would your company financially administer a cost-reimbursement type contract?  (6) Are there any other factors concerning your company’s ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider?  Respondents are requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails of intent should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.  A technical read library relating to the subject area of this acquisition is available for review by potential offerors.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors - commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

<SUBJECT>B -- Medical Radiatin Dosimetry for Epidemiologic Studies of Second Cancers
<SOLNBR>NCI-40138-NG

<CONTACT>Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov - Renita Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-8612, Fax 301-480-0241, Email rs442i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), 	Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), plans to procure services on a sole source basis for Medical Radiation Dosimetry for Epidemiologic Studies of Second Cancers with the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, Texas 77030-4009.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) seeks to describe and quantify the risk of cancer in populations exposed to ionizing radiation.  To do so requires that organ or tissue doses for large numbers of exposed individuals be estimated with a moderate to high degree of precision.  Accurate estimates of organ-specific radiation dose in individual study subjects are important for estimating dose-response relationships, evaluating joint effects of radiation and other factors, comparing results between studies, and deciding whether a proposed new study will have the statistical power to be informative.  The REB has worked closely with extramural radiation physicists to develop a program of physical dosimetry for more than 25 epidemiologic studies.  The primary aim of this procurement will be to provide medical dosimetry, for epidemiologic studies of second cancers in children and adults.  The primary objective of this contract is to provide the REB with accurate estimates of radiation dose to specific organs, or sites within organs, following medical exposure to ionizing radiation for studies of the risk of radiation-related second cancers. The contractor will work directly with the lead investigator to determine the specific requirements for this study based on the study objectives and hypotheses.  Medical physicists will compute radiation doses to the site of the second cancer and to a comparable site in the controls. Dosimetry calculations will incorporate individual data such as age at exposure, weight, height, shielding and machine leakage, and scatter parameters as in previous studies.  The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the services required.  The proposed investigator, Dr. Marilyn Stovall, has been closely involved in conducting the dosimetry component of this study of second gastrointestinal cancers in adults and second cancers of the breast and thyroid following radiotherapy for a variety of first cancers in children. Dr. Stovall has worked with NCI on the types of dosimetry data to be collected, designed the data collection forms and estimated preliminary doses to various organs for both of these studies.  It is critical for Dr. Stovall to continue to work on the dosimetry component for these studies in order to insure the consistency and validity of dosimetry results for both of these important studies.   She has been working with the Radiation Epidemiology Branch for the past 25 years to provide dosimetry for at least 30 studies of second cancers related to radiotherapy.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 27, 2004.  If you have questions, they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Solicitation number NCI-40138-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

Attachment 1 RMS Subsystems Description Software The operating system will be IBM’s z/OS 1.4.  The applications operate in both on-line and batch mode.  Modules are written in CICS, COBOL, Assembler, CA-DATACOM DB, TSO, CA-ROSCOE, CA-IDEAL, IBM JCL and CA-METACOBOL Data Base Management All of the Requirements Management Systems (RMS) processes access the RMS relational database through the Data Base Management System, (DBMS). The DBMS in use for the RMS is CA-DATACOM/DB. D200C, Equipment Item Process (EIP) The EIP provides information and usage factors, repair rates, item management computations, base allocations and authorizations and similar information needed to manage the Air Force equipment inventory, such as vehicles, voltmeters, fire extinguishers and compressors.  The EIP provides for both batch processing of interfacing files and for on-line real time access of data by equipment managers. Lines of Code: 	COBOL 562,000	JCL 6,300 D200E, Requirements Item Identification Data (RIID) Process The RID consolidates and formats catalog data from D043, Master Item Identification Control System (MIICS), into a single source of data for the RMS applications.  This system provides on-line terminal screen data retrieval and support capability to all user levels, as well as a mechanized interface with other RMS areas. Lines of Code:	COBOL 64,500	JCL 2,000 D200F, Applications, Programs, and Indentures (API) Process The API Process provides an integrated repository by indentured item application data, weapon system force structure program activity, item identification and cataloging data for requirements determinations systems.  The indenture structure has next higher assemblies with their direct component parts, allowing weapon system item relationships to be traversed in the indenture structure from top-down or bottom-up.

EPA market research indicates that Lake Superior State University is the only know contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to conduct these analyses nationally. Since these  analyses are a "national" in nature, it may take considerable time for a new contractor to become familiar with the design of the study, the analysis of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin concentrations and cell identification/enumeration of the samples.  Because of their unique familiarity with  this project, Lake Superior State University is the only known contractor capable of completing the requirements within the required time limitations. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing  such work. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Monday, August 30, 2004 at 3:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541170.  The  anticipated award date is September 1, 2004. Parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. William M. Yates, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513.487.2115, or 2.) by email (yates.william@epa.gov) referencing RFQ-OH-04-00147.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Research Triangle Park, NC, on a sole source basis with the URG Corporation for a 3000DB Semi-Volatile Organic Aerosol Sampler. The system will immediately be used for  quantifying emissions of organic carbon (OC)  and  black (elemental) carbon (EC) in gas and particle phases from in situ biomass burning and forest  canopy particle formation studies.  The URG-3000DB will be used with other gas and total  particle analyzers. The  design meets the government's  minimum performance specifications of: combined portability (<40 kg, 68" Length), volumetric flow accuracy (<10% bias), Sampling capacity (100 liters per minute), sampler media temperature control ( +/- 5 C), and power source flexibility (< 5 amp draw, AC/DC capability) required for field  applications.  This system is the only known instrument which allows assessment of upstream semi-volatile components (using denuder systems), and downstream polyurethane foam (PUF) to assess semivolatile gases breaking through or volatilizing off the filter media. This system also allows air sample  collection onto appropriate  substrates (quartz fiber and teflon filters) which may be analyzed separately for chemical (organic and inorganic) and physical properties. No other known system offers this required set of features. This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research  indicates the URG Corporation is the only known source able to satisfy the government's requirements. Since the laboratory currently contains samplers that are compatible with the URG-3000DB, the purchase of this system will facilitate data comparison between laboratories and field studies.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical  documentation to establish the potential of supplying such an instrument. Any such documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before Friday August 27,  2004 at  2:00 PM EST).  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based  upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information  received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement or to  proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 56192   EPA intends to award a sole source procurement on or about August 26, 2004 to the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI) pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1):--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory has a need for  technical support to jointly sponsor, plan, and execute the September 21-22, 2004 International Biomonitoring Workshop to be held at the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's Research Triangle  Park, NC location.  Improved biomonitoring technologies are now being used to measure very low levels of synthetic and natural chemicals in the tissues of adults, children, and developing fetuses.  These measurements show that chemicals in the  environment are absorbed into the human body.  However, in most cases, it is not known if this will lead to adverse health outcomes.  Additionally, without information on exposure pathways, it is difficult to relate biomonitoring results back to sources of exposure and to develop effective methods  for reducing exposures and risks.  By working together, EPA,  the International Life Sciences Institute Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (HESI), and other subject matter experts will be directly involved in a high profile international effort to extend the state of the science as it  relates to biomarker use and development.  ILSI HESI is a nonprofit, worldwide foundation that seeks to improve the well-being of the general public through the advancement of science.  Its mission is to provide an international forum to advance the state of science on current issues of interest to  the public, scientific community, government agencies and industry  related to human health, toxicology, risk assessment and environmental health.  HESI has a long history of sponsoring events which impartially draw upon the expertise of industry, academia, and government researchers in order to  summarize current knowledge in a particular area and to make recommendations regarding the most important next steps that are required to advance the state-of-the-science.  HESI is a worldwide foundation whose organizational structure facilitates access to international biomonitoring experts to  participate in the workshop which is critical to the success of this effort. HESI  is uniquely qualified to sponsor this workshop because they are widely acknowledged within the international scientific community as impartial advocates who work to advance environmental science research, they  convened the Biomonitoring Subcommittee in October 2003 and, they have a significant history of similar successful collaborative meetings, which are all critical to the success of this effort. No other known contractor has the experience and structural organization to conduct such a workshop or  provide the technical expertise within the required schedule.  The final plan for the workshop must be provided to EPA in time for the workshop to be held September 21-22, 2004.  No Request for Quotation is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  All  responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Otelia Newsome at the above address for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the  ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient  to make a determination that competition is feasible.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, a purchase order will be placed with the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) Health and Environmental Sciences Institute  (HESI).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number: RFQ6904, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This procurement shall be solicited under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small- Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) code is 339111.  The USDA, National Soil Tilth Laboratory has a requirement to purchase an Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) System.  Please quote one each of the following: (1) FTIR base module (IMACC Base Unit or EQUAL); (2) ZnSe beam splitter upgrade from KBr; (3) HgCdTe detector upgrade form DTGS; (4) Monostatic open-path transmission accessory; (5) Tetro array with 60 2.5in, less than 20arc-sec elements with NEMA enclosure; and (6) UPS/filter.   The items you are offering must meet or exceed the following salient characteristics. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS   It is built with the same modular components as most FTIR systems so it can be configured for open-path measurements as well as cell-based laboratory/field measurements.  The basic monostatic open-path system can operate directly in: (1) Monostatic transmission mode, (2) Bistatic transmission mode, or (3) Passive radiance mode. This same system with a low cost accessory can also operate in (4) Cell-based extractive mode. The system can be converted to any of these modes in a matter of minutes. In monostatic transmission mode the IR source is in the FTIR.  The infrared (IR) beam is modulated by the FTIR and transmitted through the air to a retro-reflector array.  The returned beam is detected by the monostatic system.  In bistatic transmission mode the IR source is at the far end of the path and its radiation is detected by the FTIR.  In either of these modes, a transmission spectrum is generated for the intervening air and it is analyzed to detect the gases present as well as their concentrations.  In passive radiance mode no IR source is used, instead hot gases leaving a stack, a fire, etc. are themselves the IR source.  In this mode a radiance spectrum is produced containing features of all hot gases present.  The radiance spectrum is then used to detect and quantify the gases present.  The open-path system can also be used with an optional conversion unit to make the FTIR a cell-based analyzer such as used in the laboratory.  This mode of operation can be used to analyze any gaseous sample drawn through the cell.  Systems of this type are used for laboratory analyses of samples as well as analysis of samples drawn from an external emission source or even the ambient air. DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS The requested open-path system consists of an FTIR Base Module and a telescope-based open-path accessory.  A cell based accessory must be available for attachment to the base system.  The Base Module contains the FTIR modulator, laser control systems, power supply, and on-board control electronics.  The open-path accessory contains the telescope, the coupling optics for the FTIR and both radiance-mode and monostatic transmission mode optics.  The cell-based accessory, if used, contains a fixed-path or variable-path cell, pressure and temperature control systems, and coupling optics for the Base Module. The FTIR Base Unit : (1) 0.125 cm-1 FTIR modulator , (2) Stable “dash-pot” mirror movement, (3)Dynamic alignment for computer controlled auto alignment and dynamic stabilization during operation, (4)High throughput 2” aperture, (5)Interchangeable beam splitters and detectors allowing for visible, near IR and far IR operation , (6)Optional ZnSe beam splitter and high D* HgCdTe detector (used for all open-path systems), (7)Long coherence length HeNe laser for FTIR and dynamic alignment control, (8)Base plate configuration to couple with any (IMACC or EQUAL) accessory.  The Telescope-Based Accessory: (1) 12” diameter Cassegrain telescope, (2)Pyrex optical elements with front surface aluminum, over coated with SiO for easy cleaning, (3)Effective focal length of 180” for high degree of beam collimation, (4)Dual optical systems for rapid conversion between monostatic transmission mode and either bistatic transmission or passive radiance modes, (5)Laser alignment accessories for rapid checking or aligning of the full system. Corner Cube Array: (1) 20” X 20” Corner cube (retro reflector) array, (2) All cubes 2.5” with better than 20 arc second accuracy, (3) Front surface gold coated with SiO overcoats, (4) Full NEMA 4 enclosure. Software Requirements (included with Base Unit) : Software must be able to  Quantify – for graphical development and testing of analysis methods;  Monitor – for automated acquisition, analysis, and display of data; and an editor- for “drag-and-drop” creation of sequences of events for the FTIR as well as external equipment.  Software must also include spectroscopic and analysis tools such as synthetic Io generation, spectral averaging, and automated purging of files for unmanned systems. Special Analytical Features:  The analysis software must have built in full linearity correction of all data for arbitrary concentration ranges, spectral line shift correction of spectra before analysis eliminating the significant errors that can occur due to shift, full bias correction for bias induced by strongly absorbing species in the gas matrix.  The software also has as a package full analysis of radiance data. Libraries: Must be delivered with three libraries at 25C, 100C, and 185C.  Each library contains absolutely calibrated references for compounds of interest to industrial and environmental monitoring.  Each library also contains a series library containing spectra of analytes from low to very high concentrations for use in establishing or checking linearity of compounds in a developed method.   Support:  Must have personnel recognized as experts in the field of spectroscopy.  The company provides free of charge unlimited telephone or modem/internet support of all clients for the first six months of system ownership.  This includes, for example, support for field measurements, analytical methods development, data QA/QC, and specialized analytical/measurement issues.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement to issue a follow-on hardware contract to replace N00019-02-C-3066 as a final buy out with one base year and two one-year options for the procurement of engineering and technical support for the legacy AN/TSQ-142 Tactical EA-6B Mission Support (TEAMS) System.  The TEAMS system manages the EA-6B tactical database, creates mission critical loads for the ALQ-99, and performs post-flight analysis of EA-6B flight mission data.  The AN/TSQ-142 system consists of two J600, one HP-735 TAC-3 processor, an operator control station, and several input/output devices.  The system has several custom interface boards.  The efforts to be procured include updating the TEAMS maintenance guides and several other manuals necessary for the operators of the TEAMS legacy system.  Updating these manuals requires in-depth knowledge of the TEAMS system, the EA-6B aircraft software and weapons, and several other DoD electronic warfare systems.  Additionally, technical support efforts will be procured for the installation of several new hardware sub-components into the TEAMS system.  These installations will occur at several deployed sites, including aboard aircraft carriers.  Northrop Grumman PRB Systems is the designer, developer, and the sole manufacturer of TEAMS and is the only known source with the in-depth knowledge of equipment necessary to perform this effort to meet program schedule requirements.  The estimated period of performance is November 2004 through October 2006.  This announcement is for information only.  Synopsis No. 20049-04 See note No. 22!!

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Molecular Imaging Program (MIP), plans to procure on a sole source basis for a CRI Maestro In-Vivo Imaging System from Cambridge Research and Instrumentation Inc. 35-B Cabot Road, Woburn, MA  01801.  The MIP develops and tests new targeted imaging probes for the detection and characterization of cancer.  They are developing novel imaging agents using MRI, optical, radionuclide and PET emitters or “beacons”.  One of the major new types of imaging probes is fluorescent optical imaging agents that can only be “excited” and detected with special cameras.  The program is developing a variety of new optical imaging probes linked to specific receptor-ligands that can be used in vivo and require special imaging cameras.  The Maestro is the only camera that has liquid crystal technology.  Liquid crystal technology is a unique light filtering system that uses a liquid crystal filter to cycle through wavelengths from approximately 450 nm to 1200nm.  The systems does not require the physical switching of separate filters which is a slow and cumbersome process, and the proprietary technology allows the full range of light filtration by applying varying electric currents to the liquid crystal thus giving a full spectral readout.  Moreover, by comparing the pre enhanced spectral readout to the post enhanced spectral readout one can subtract background autofluorescence thus improving probe detection.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. Cambridge Research and Instrumentation Inc. is the only source known to the end user that is capable of providing an in-vivo imaging system that meets the above required specification.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau is developing the Field Data Collection Automation (FDCA) Program to automate the collection of survey data in the field to reduce the cost and improve the quality of the 2010 Decennial Census.

The Census Bureau is in the Market Research/Industry Engagement stage of this effort for the FDCA Program.  This stage will be used to engage industry in order to more fully understand the scope of current and practical technologies, processes, and approaches for FDCA, and so that potential bidders can obtain a more solid understanding of FDCA’s possible requirements and objectives. 

The Census Bureau will soon release an initial Field Data Collection Automation Program Scope Definition document that establishes a baseline range of services and products that may be acquired through this procurement. The Census Bureau will also conduct an “Industry Day” as a critical element of market research for the FDCA program. A dedicated Census Bureau website has been set up to allow prospective vendors access to the Program Scope Definition document and other relevant reference materials.  This site can be found at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/fdca.  Companies are encouraged to check this site frequently for updates pertaining to the FDCA program.

Industry Day will be held at the Census Bureau Headquarters in Suitland, MD, on August 27, 2004.  The Industry Day will include a briefing by Census Bureau management to offer an overview of the FDCA program.  Time and space will also be set aside to allow vendors the opportunity to display their products and capabilities for other vendors.  More details, registration information, and directions to the Census Bureau can be found on the FDCA website noted above.  The Census Bureau is interested in hearing from vendors that have established proven technology to accomplish the FDCA goals, or any vendors that may have new or innovative equipment, processes, or techniques relevant to the FDCA mission.  

Interested vendors should understand that the scope and requirements of the FDCA program are still being defined, and the Census Bureau seeks to interact with innovative companies in order to understand the alternatives and capabilities offered by industry.  The information obtained from industry during market research will be used to help define the requirements that will ultimately be acquired through open competition.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation package will not be issued.  Solicitation number TIRNO-04-Q-MSA07 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) with the evaluation and award prescribed in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  This procurement is small business set-aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561410 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award and 4 one-year options periods.  REQUIREMENT:  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Small Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) Division, Learning & Education (L&E) function requires contractor support for word processing of developed technical course material.  This course material shall be processed using Information Mapping software that uses that “chunking” of information to transform the course material into a readable education format.  BACKGROUND:  Learning and Education Compliance NCFB Group has responsibility for a variety of courses and classes including CPE and specialty programs.  Material for these classes varies in size from 500 hundred pages to several thousand.  Total material for the contract year will range from 15,000 to 24,000 pages.  Approximately 90% of the material will be available in electronic format containing handwritten edits on the accompanying hardcopy.  This material requires word processing (editing, formatting, spell checking, etc.) and must be processed using Information Mapping software.  SCOPE AND PURPOSE:  The IRS shall provide the course material as it is developed.  The contractor shall word process the work and return to IRS for review within two weeks of receipt.  The IRS will review the material, and return to the contractor for corrections.  These corrections shall be completed in 3 business days.  All material produced by the contractor is subject to final approval by IRS.  The IRS will batch the course material in batches of 500 – 3,000 pages.  The contractor shall be located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, as there may be occasions where a courier is needed for prompt turnaround of the materials.  IRS estimates that at least 90% of the developed course material will exist in an IMS word and require conversion to information mapping format.  Small amounts of handwritten edits may also be included.  A small percentage (approximately 10%) may require typing into the information mapping format.  The final product will be course material formatted in Information Mapping and delivered as one hard copy and one CD-Rom per course.  All materials developed under this award are the property of the IRS.  Any materials developed for use on a personal computer must comply with section 508 requirements.  Work shall be performed at the contractor’s location.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS:  The IRS shall provide course materials in an electronic format and access to technical personnel for guidance.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Dept of Army, CECOM, AMSEL-AC-CC-RT-F, Ft. Monmouth, NJ  07703-5000 UNCOOLED B-KIT (UBK) DEVELOPMENT (PHASE II)  The U.S. Army Product Manager Forward Looking Infrared (PM FLIR) intends to solicit proposals, on a full and open competitive basis, for the Phase II Development of the Uncooled B-Kit (UBK), Solicitation Number W15P7T-04-R-J293.  The UBK is an infrared ima ging module intended to be used in a wide variety of thermal devices such as the DriverÃ¢Â€Â™s Vision Enhancer (DVE), thermal weapon sights, head-mounted thermal imaging systems, Future Combat Systems (FCS), Situational Awareness Sensor Suites, missile see ker systems, Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), and physical security systems. This announcement pertains to the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s plans to award up to three cost-plus contracts with a 12-15 month period of performance for the UBK Phase II program.  The overall purpose of the Uncooled B-Kit Program is to define, develop and procure common infrared (IR) sensor modules to be used in the widest possible range of equipment/systems that require uncooled IR detection and imaging subsystems.   Equipment/syst ems that now use different uncooled IR technology solutions will then be able to share a common IR detector module without sacrificing system performance.  This specific procurement represents the second of three phases.  Phase I, currently on-going, is a Risk Reduction Demonstration (RRD) with the following goals:  validation of the Interface Control Document (ICD); and qualification of performance and command & control via bench-level demonstration and test.  The second phase continues the RRD with the fo llowing objectives:  validate and verify the electro-optical performance, environmental robustness, reliability at the camera-level (per the performance specification);  validate and verify the electronic, mechanical and optical interfaces (per the ICD); a nd demonstrate UBK camera-level interchangeability.  Further, Phase II will focus on the Ã¢Â€ÂœU3Ã¢Â€Â configuration as defined in the performance specification and ICD Phase III is planned to entail system-level (e.g. DVE, FCS) integration and qualificat ion testing.  For planning purposes, UBK Phase II final RFP release is planned for Oct 2004.  PM FLIR and US Army CECOM will host an open session Industry Conference at PM FLIR, 10221 Burbeck Rd, Fort Belvoir, VA  22060 (Kelly Conference Room, 2nd Floor, Bldg 399) to address UBK Phase II requirements and solicit industry feedback on the Draft RFP.  The date will be posted to the IBOP at a later date.   The meeting will consist of a general briefing to all attendees following by one-on-one meetings with interested prime offerors (potential subs should coordinate with primes).  The schedule for the In dustry Day is as follows:  0900 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1000 General Briefing; 1000 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1050 One-on-One Session A; 1100 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1150 One-on-One Session B; 1300 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1350 One-on-One Session C; 1400- 1450 One-on-One Session D (if necessary); 1500 Ã¢Â€Â“ 1550 One-on-One S ession E (if necessary).  Please contact Chris Heim, contract specialist, 732-427-1603, Christopher.Andrew.Heim@us.army.mil to indicate your intention to attend the conference, provide names of attendees and respective security clearances, and request a On e-on-One Session (please send questions for Government review).  Each potential offeror is limited to a maximum of five (5) attendees.

<DESC>The Department of Labor, International Child Labor Program, is seeking services from qualified professionals under Request for Proposals number DOL049RP10014.  This inotice amends the initial notice and amendment previously issued.  The entire notice and attached documents have been published on the Federal Business Opportunities website; applicable documents must be downloaded from the website and will not be provided by DOL.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 541720, size standard of $6 million.  A Statement of Work and complete solicitation provisions, including proposal preparation instructions and evaluation factors under Sections L and M, are included in the attached documents.  This notice provides the following additional questions and answers:
Q:  Does "doing all the logistics to facilitate the travel of existing ICLP project implementing" require that the contractor pay all travel costs and directly-associated costs (airfare, train, hotel, per diem, visas, taxi, etc.) or just providing the logistical support of scheduling flights, booking hotel rooms, getting clearances, and making arrangements for local transportation while at the annual meetings?  A:  The contractor needs to do all the logistics and pay for all travel costs for a select group of grantees.  This cost will be reimbursed to the contractor afterwards by the DOL, by means of submission of an invoice to the DOL and payment thereafter.  The amount has been estimated on what DOL paid in the past when DOL did this in-house.  Q:  Does the contractor have any responsibility to coordinate and pay for the costs associated with the two annual meetings such as refreshments, facility, equipment and directly associated costs?  Are the meetings to be held in DOL facilities?  A:  Yes, the contractor is in charge of this coordination and associated costs.  The 100,000 was an estimate for only ONE annual meeting for organizations implementing ICLP projects.  The meetings have been held in both DOL and outside facilities.  Space is an issue.  With sufficient time, we can find facilities at DOL to accommodate participants and we will attempt to do so this year, fur the contractor should budget for 100-125 persons notwithstanding.  It could rise to 150 in subsequent years.  If the contractor is proposing another meeting for exchange of best practices that could be another meeting held in the same year, but would require a separate budget apart from the $100,000.  The total amount would depend on the number of participants.   The date and time for submission of proposals is unchanged.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) intends to award a sole source contract for data management support to The EMMES Corporation of Rockville, MD.  NIAID intends to award a one year contract with the option for two additional years beginning on or after October 1, 2004.  The resulting contract will also contain the provision at FAR 52.217-8.  The contractor will be responsible for providing data management support for the VRC Clinical Trials Core.  EMMES has performed as the sole compiler and processor of all comprehensive clinical data collected for all currently ongoing Phase I clinical trials carried out by the VRC Clinical Trials Core.  This data management function is essential to ensure that the results of clinical trials of novel vaccine strategies can be rapidly and efficiently analyzed at study completion, and to permit frequent review of interim safety and accrual data during conduct of a clinical trial.  This comprehensive data management is essential for accomplishment of VRC clinical research goals and to meet Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR312) requirements for the proper conduct of the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the Investigational New Drug applications for new vaccine products.  The current Phase I clinical trials have been initiated using EMMES Internet Data Entry System (IDES), and must be completed using the same protocols to preserve these trials' utility for ultimate licensure of candidate vaccines.  It is not possible to transfer these trial data management functions to another contractor without restarting clinical trials from their inception, a step that would impose a loss of several years time in the development process to achieving an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine.  Please refer any questions in writing to Terrie Nestor at tnestor@niaid.nih.gov by August 27, 2004 at 2:00 pm EDT.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to synopsis is to alert interested parties of the Government’s decision to open the acquisition to full and open competition.  This announcement also introduces resultant clarifications to the original announcement, repeated here for convenient reference.  

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to solicit   proposals on a competitive basis  for the acquisition of an irrevocable, perpetual license to use 750 knockout mice, delivered as frozen embryos, sperm, and ES cells to designated Depositories, which shall act under separate contract to NIH to maintain and distribute the material. All these mice should carry a null allele with a reporter gene.  The Depositories will distribute the Materials to academic users along with a royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual license to use the Material for non-commercial research purposes.  Academic Institutions will be free to file patents on discoveries made with the Material without reach-through rights to the successful offeror or any other party.
The Government  also intends to acquire a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license to use and host a database containing detailed phenotyping information on all 750 mice for academic and other non-commercial purposes.  Restrictions on the use of the Database for academic and other non-commercial purposes will be removed after four years.  

The proposed acquisition will include a  non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, and fully-paid up license to publish in other works or media any of the data from the Database and to create derivative works of any of the data by extracting or reformatting all or any portion of the data, whether in its original form or any revised, annotated or modified forms.

The proposed contract will provide to academic investigators world-wide access to a significant fraction of this unique line of knockout mice along with a database containing extensive phenotypic data on each of the 750 knockout lines.
	
The estimated release date for the solicitation is late August.  The estimated receipt date for proposals is mid September.  Electronic versions of the RFP will be available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rtb/rfp.htm.    All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  See note No. 26.

<DESC>Modification to submission posted on FedBizOpps on July 30, 2004.  Forest Service requires tailings removal from the Pope-Shenon mine site.  The project is located on the Salmon/Cobalt Ranger District, Salmon-Challis National Forest, Lemhi County, Idaho.  The project consists of, but is not limited to, hauling and placing approximately 4,300 cubic yards of mine tailings to a repository located at the Pope-Shenon mine site.  The tailings repository will be constructed with the excavated tailings and capped with 1 foot of native soil and 1 foot of riprap available on-site.  Two sediment basins will also be constructed to collect tailings that may erode from the mine site.  Several existing roads will require general improvement for tailings haulage and two new temporary roads will need to be opened to access tailings.  The temporary roads will require closure at the end of the project and all disturbed areas will be reclaimed and seeded.  This project will be advertised as a written quotation and will be solicited under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The performance period shall be 45 calendar days.  Work is estimated to start October 1, 2004.  Quotes are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, September 13, 2004.  The estimated price range is $25,000 to $100,000.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to award and have proper bonding capability.  You may register at www.ccr.gov.

Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to friefing charts and further details is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal I. Questions/Answers: Q77.  What is a  proposer supposed to classify themselves on item 4 of the NOI form if they don’t fall under one of the following 4 categories “NASA Center,” “Academia,” “Private Industry,” and “Non-Profit?” A77.	“Non-Profit” under Item 4 of the NOI form has been changed to “Non-Profit/Other” to include those who did not fall under one of the original categories, which also includes other Government agencies. REVISED QUESTION/ANSWER #60. Q60. Appendix C of the BAA seems to have been written for the internal NASA BAA. For instance, in section 2 under the Lead Individual it states "Name of Other Relevant NASA Personal". Is there an NOI specifically for the external BAA? A60. This NOI applies to the external BAA. Part 1-3 requires you to list the Key individuals that are not NASA, and Part 2a requires you to provide the summaries of all the key individuals, including your NASA partners. Revised answer: This NOI applies to the external BAA. Part 1-3 requires you to list the Key individuals. Other than the Principal Investigator, the key individuals may be NASA individuals.  Part 2a requires you to provide the summaries of all the key individuals, including your NASA partners.

<DESC>---Amendment #1 - This is to notify all parties that the tours scheduled for August 18 and 20, 2004 are postponed until after issuance of the RFQ.  Another amendment will be issued with the exact date.---

The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking a qualified, golf course developer to develop and operate the White Oak Golf Course within the Federal Research Center (FRC) at White Oak in Silver Spring, Maryland. 

GSA has identified three objectives for the development and operation of the White Oak Golf Course. These objectives are: 
1. Leveraging private sector experience, resources, and capital to manage, redevelop, and upgrade the golf course while maintaining the integrity of the FDA complex and preserving a historic resource. 
2. Enhancing community outreach by facilitating interaction between private sector and local community. 
3. Using the Cooperative Use Act to increase the value of the golf course to the government.
This Request for Qualifications (RFQ) represents an opportunity for developers and development teams interested in being considered as the developer and operator of the White Oak Golf Course.  The RFQ stage is the first stage in a two-stage selection process. The objective of this RFQ stage is to identify the most highly qualified developers based on key factors that will be outlined in this document.  In the Requests for Proposals (RFP) stage, GSA will issue an RFP to the 'short-list' of qualified developers that are identified at the RFQ stage.  Please note-THIS RFQ DOCUMENT REPRESENTS YOUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO BE QUALIFIED AND PLACED ON THE SHORT LIST FOR THE RFP.  

The idea to seek a private developer/operator for White Oak golf course comes at a great time for those interested in responding.  It is anticipated that the potential customer base for White Oak golf course will continue to grow tremendously over the next five years.   

---Pre-Submission Tours are scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on August 18 and August 20, 2004. Interested parties should contact Sheldon Jobe, 202/260-0767, to schedule participation.---

<DESC>1.	SOLICITATION NUMBER:		29/2004	
2.	ISSUANCE DATE:			08/12/2004	
3.	CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS:	08/26/2004 (6 p.m. Almaty Time) 
4.	POSITION TITLE:			PROGRAM OFFICER
5.	MARKET VALUE:			$62,905 - $81,778 per annum (GS-13                                                                		equivalent) 
6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Short-term (one month)
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for the Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is responsible for the development and management of the USG regional assistance program directed at improving livelihoods through support to economic, democratic, social sector, and natural resources reform and development in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

The Program Support Office provides traditional programmatic support to the USAID/CAR Mission.  The office’s principal functions include:  a) management of the program budget; b) monitoring/evaluation of program performance and analyses of program strategic relevance and direction; c) oversight of the program approval process; d) oversight and final preparation of Mission reporting requirements, principally the annual report; e) preparation and dissemination of public information material; and f) management of the Participant Training Program and the Eurasia Foundation grant.

The FY 04 program budget is approximately $109 million, with a carryover FY 03 budget of approximately $25 million.  The USAID/Central Asia Republic Mission is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Dushanbe, Tajikistan and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.  The technical programs in the Mission focus on energy/water, health, enterprise development, democracy/conflict mitigation, and education.

There is strong Washington interest in the program, including close scrutiny by Congress as well as by the State Department.  Funding for the program is authorized through the Freedom Support Act.  The State Department is responsible for implementation of the Act, and USAID programming is done in very close coordination with the embassies in each of the countries and the State Department’s Coordinator’s office in Washington, D.C., which has oversight responsibility for implementation of the Freedom Support Act.

The Program Support Office is responsible for management and/or oversight of Strategic Objective 4.2 (the cross-cutting SO), which includes one contract (Participant Training), two cooperative agreements (the Arizona-Kazakhstan Partnership and Eurasia Foundation), carryover budgeting for basic education and conflict prevention, and funding for program development and support.

B) Major Duties and Responsibilities

The contractor will provide short-term expertise to the Program Support Office from on/about September 27 through on/about October 22.  The contractor will report to the Project Development Officer, Acting Program Support Office Director; and, manage the Program Support Office from October 4-8 during the Project Development Officer’s absence.  During the Project Development Officer’s absence, the contractor will report to the Deputy Mission Director, and be responsible for all aspects of programming oversight, including the program budget, cross-cutting activities, activity approval, policy-related questions, preparation of information products, and an office of five personnel.  

The contractor’s other responsibilities, to be performed during the contractual period include:

1.	Assisting with programmatic and budget support services to Mission technical offices and country offices, particularly as this pertains to the FY 04 and FY 05 budgets.

2.	Providing necessary follow-up to intensive reviews for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, scheduled at the end of September.  

3.	Managing the Mission’s preparation for a semi-annual review, to be scheduled in October or November.  

4.	Assisting with planning for and preparation of the Mission’s FY 04 Annual Report, including drafting a summary of Annual Report guidance for SO teams and organizing and delivering, in cooperation with the Project Development Officer and the FSN Project Management Specialist, a session with SO teams to explain changes in the Annual Report application and guidance.  

5.	Consulting donor and host country strategies for the Central Asia region and developing a summary of non-USG programming.  Review with the Project Development Officer strategic focus and direction of the USAID/CAR strategy and programs and provide recommendations for the Mission’s future strategy development.

6.	Assisting with the finalization of concept papers for the E&E Bureau’s GDA Incentive
Fund.

7.	Other duties as assigned.

C) Supervision and Relationships

The contractor will be supervised by the Project Development Officer, and by the Deputy Mission Director during the Project Development Officer’s absence.  The contractor will supervise the following program support office staff during the Project Development Officer’s absence:
1 US Resident PSC Information Specialist – GS-12
	1 FSN Program Budget Specialist – FSN-11
	1 FSN Project Management Specialist – FSN-12
1 FSN Project Management Specialist – FSN-10	
1 FSN Administrative Assistant – FSN-7

Although direct supervision of the Participant Training Program and the two cooperative agreements rests with the FSN-12 Project Management Specialist, the contractor will provide appropriate technical direction and leadership during the Project Development Officer’s absence.

D) Other Factors

A high degree of tact, firmness, and creativity is required at all times.  Interpersonal skills are also at a premium, given the large number of people both within and outside the U.S. Mission with which the Program Support Office must engage.  Mission technical offices operate with a high degree of autonomy and program support functions must be adaptive to a value-added approach.

E) Required Qualifications

Five or more years as a USAID program officer is required.  Supervisory management experience is preferred.  Specific experience in working with USAID program budget management is required.  Excellent analytical and team building skills are essential.  References are required.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando has a requirement for products and support for the V-22 Training System.  The V-22 weapons system is preparing for a Milestone III decision next year and a decision to proceed with full rate production will require that a robust and fully supported training system be in place to properly prepare crews and maintainers to operate this revolutionary aircraft.  And to fully utilize the capability of the V-22 training system, the training products must be kept current with the aircraft as it is modified and upgraded, and current with changes to tactics, techniques, and procedures that affect the way the weapon system is employed and thus the way that it must be trained.
  
NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQC)  with Cost Plus Fixed Fee/Firm Fixed Price delivery orders.  The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $10M contract over a 60-month period.  This requirement will be solicited as an 8(a) set aside on a competitive basis if responses result in adequate competition.  Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.  

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U. S. Department of Commerce, is conducting a market survey for a potential commercial item acquisition to procure replacement communications devices used within the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This synopsis advertises NOAA’s potential need for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) communications device that is able to provide satellite data transfer between satellite tracking stations and multiple data processing centers. The current data communications device is the Harris Corporation designed System Communications Unit (SCU). The communications device replacing the SCU will need to simultaneously transmit multiple channels of synchronous, asynchronous, and isochoronous data types using modern network technology over terrestrial and satellite-based communication circuits. The product is also required to simultaneously transfer ternary satellite command data between a processing center and a remote site. The capability to simultaneously deliver data from one site to multiple destinations is also required. The communications device needs to provide either a guaranteed fixed communications time delay between units or a means of appending a time stamp to encrypted satellite data before it is transmitted from a remote site. The communications device must be able to be controlled and monitored from a central location. The specific requirements for the SCU replacement device can be found in the SCU Replacement Technical Requirements Document (TRD). All specifications within the TRD are mandatory. The replacement units are believed to be commercial items as defined in FAR 2.101. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELEASE ANY SOLICITATION. This market survey is being conducted in accordance with Public Law 103-355 (41 U.S.C. 264 note), and the information below is expressed as a statement of need for a commercial item, as outlined in FAR 12.202. THEREFORE, this advertisement is to conduct market research to identify whether a commercial item can fulfill this mission and define an approach for acquiring the units.  In response to this survey, interested Offerors are required to provide a detailed description of their commercial product along with a matrix showing compliance with the TRD. The response shall also include the vendor’s repair capabilities, training, licensing requirements, and maintenance philosophy. Respondents are also required to provide a budgetary price and delivery quote for up to 35 units including warranty protection for up to five (5) years beyond the base year (priced in annual increments). Budgetary price is to include first article test at the Vendor’s facility.  The Government intends to use its Contractor, Harris Technical Services Corporation in Bellevue, Nebraska to assist in evaluating the responses for compliance with the requirements contained herein and in the TRD. Respondents may also submit non-disclosure agreements for the Government’s 3rd-party test by Harris Corporation.  After evaluation of the written responses, the Government intends to select two or more responsive offerors to provide production devices to Harris for evaluation. The Government will task Harris to perform bench testing of candidate COTS devices meeting the requirements contained herein and in the TRD. Based upon this test and evaluation, the Government will determine the most feasible COTS alternative to the Harris SCU. Any products provided for the test and evaluation will be solely at the offeror’s risk and expense and does not imply any obligation on the part of the Government for any subsequent order. Further, the offeror is invited to attend the bench testing at Offeror’s sole expense at the Harris facility in Bellevue, Nebraska. The bench testing results for each vendor will be provided at the conclusion of the testing and the vendor offered the opportunity to address and rectify any identified discrepancies to the Government’s satisfaction prior to any subsequent order. If it is determined that a COTS unit can replace the Harris SCU, the Government will task Harris to procure up to 35 units. The process of this survey request is described in FAR subpart 11.002. The Government intends to use streamlined procedures if a solicitation follows from the results of this survey. NOAA intends, in any subsequent solicitation, to tailor the provision of FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-4 to include addenda to the terms, which may include the following: indefinite quantity & indefinite delivery ordering; performance and quantity options; financing provisions, if applicable; progress reporting requirements; and Government-required inspection and acceptance procedures—if applicable to commercial practices. Optional quantities above the priced value within the scope of this contract’s ordering authority is also anticipated. IMPORTANT!! Those interested in this requirement who wish to obtain a copy of the TRD required to complete the compliance matrix, should contact the NPOESS/IPO point of contact, Captain James Englehart, USAF, via email at james.englehart@noaa.gov or 301 713-4830 and provide full contact information.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Administrative Support Center has a requirement to acquire services to perform research on Lake Champlain in Vermont, for the NOAA, Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL), Ann Arbor MI.  For the past 12 years GLERL has participated in a large scale multi-institutional program to study Lake Champlain.  This effort, mandated by Congress is a cooperative effort between the Lake Champlain Research Consortium (LCRC), GLERL and NOAA Atmospheric Research Lab (ARL).  The research direction for 2004-2005 is to expand investigations to the northeast portion of Lake Champlain, the most poorly understood regions of the Lake.  It requires a detailed hydrodynamic investigation of the inland sea of the lake.   The research is intended to obtain a better understanding of its relationship to the main lake and it baroclinic interactionss. Another component of the program will be determination of the internal dynamic of northern sector of the Inland Sea where no deep or intermediate observations exist.  Another component will be to understand more about the surface seiche through the use of high- resolution pressure- temperature gauges.  A new flow velocimeter will be installed at the Grand Isle drawbridge passsage to look at correlations between Inland Sea forcing and that of the transport through the Gut and into and out of the Main Lake.  Dr. Hunkins will conduct the analytical and numerical modeling of the Inland Sea intending to provide the basic understanding of circulation and flow dynamics in the Sea.  Previously acquired sidescan data (from the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum-Middlebury College Whole Lake Survey Program; 1996-2004) will be used to help define long term circulation patterns via sediment bedform structures.  Lastly, the team will deploy a self-contained laser-optic sediment analyzer (LISST-25) to look at sediment re-suspension events as well as temporal variability of size distribution of sediment particles in the water column.  The effort described herein requires extensive use of the unique historical knowledge possessed by a research team lead by Thomas Manley from the Geology Department at Middlebury College, Middlebury VT as well as the data that has been collected but not yet processed by the team.  The mean circulation patterns of Lake Champlain have been very difficult to obtain using long-term Eulerian measurement techniques due to the large oscillatory motions created by the internal seich.  Manley’s team began novel studies in Lake Champlain to address this issue by developing a unique set of deep-ocean neutrally-buoyant free-drifter technology buoys know as RAFOS.  In addition to Dr. Tom Manley, the research participants include Dr. Jean Claude Gascard from Laboratoire D’Oceanologie Dynamique et de Climatologie, LODYC, Paris, and Dr. Ken Hunkins from Columbia University.  Dr. Gascard is a world leading authority on RAFOS technology.  The use of such underwater acoustics is essential to the success of the program in that underwater drifters have to be able to detect and verify the encoded signals emitted by the various sound sources moored at precise locations within the lake.  Further, the possession of a crucial long-term, 7-year data set is critical to the success of the integrated research program.  Dr. Manley’s team has collected extensive sidescan sonar data from 1996-2003 in cooperation with the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum  Dr. Manley is the recognized authority on Lake Champlain hydrodynamics and has spend numerous years studying the lakes physics.  encoded signals emitted by the various sound sources moored at precise locations within the lake.    NOAA intends to negotiate with Dr. Tom Manley and Middlebury College for the effort pursuant to the authority of 41USC253(c)(1), only one responsible source.  NOAA knows of no other sources that possess the technical expertise and unique scientific instrumentation needed to conduct the research.    The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   Any responsible firm interested in this requirement may submit its qualifications via fax to  (816) 426-5067, Attention Sharon Walker .  Information should reference number NRMAF000-4-05032.   The DOC requires that all contractors doing business with the Government  are registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.

<RESPDATE>091504
<ARCHDATE>11142004
<CONTACT>Charlene Bell, 256-842-7687
<DESC>1.  Purpose - The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to collect information to be used in support of a Business Case Analysis (BCA) to be used to help determine the most effective means of depot support for the A2C2S.  This RFI is being  published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201 and is for planning purposes only.  The government does not intend to enter into business relationship based solely on the information received from this request, or to reimburse the costs incurred by any respo ndent for providing the information requested.  These efforts are being performed as part of a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) initiative. 2.  The System To Be Supported 2.1  The A2C2S is an on-the-move Command and Control (C2)system that enables commanders and their staffs to maintain digital connectivity while operating from a temporary remote site or while moving through/over the battle space.  The C2 system consists of  two kits:  An A-Kit and B-Kit.  The A-Kit is permanently affixed to the host aircraft, the UH-60L, and consists of antennas, wiring, floor modifications and aircraft interfaces (power, structural, etc.) to enable installation of the B-Kit in the host plat form. 2.2  The B-Kit consists of operator workstations, computer and networking systems, and the communications equipment required to host and support the C2 process.  The computer and networking assemblies are Common Hardware and Software (CHS) supported items. 2.3  A2C2S provides a robust communications suite.  The suite includes multiple Very High Frequency (VHF), Frequency Modulation (FM) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Line-of-Sight (LOS) Combat Net Radios (CNRs), and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)CNR bands, such as  High Frequency (HF) and Satellite Communications-Demand Assigned Multiple Access (SATCOM-DAMA) as well as wide-band digital radios, and the TOCNET intercom system.  This connectivity enables warfighters to exercise C2 of assigned and attached elements and  to coordinate with adjacent, supported, and supporting forces via voice and data equipment with battlefield information processing and connectivity.  The majority of the communications suite is organically supported.  The exceptions are the ARC-231 which is Raytheon supported and the TOCNET intercom which is CHS supported. 2.4.  Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) software is acquired, managed, and maintained by each associated Battlefield Functional Area (BFA) PMO, and constitutes the vast majority of the software script being utilized on the A2C2S.  However, A2C2S does requ ire a software set to facilitate system initiation, data synchronization, system self test, and radio/intercom control functions.  At this time, the OEM (Raytheon) is responsible for the development and maintenance of the A2C2S specific software. 2.5  Blue Force Tracking - Aviation (BFT-A)is an attached subsytem that receives power from the A2C2S B-Kit and pushes data through the B-Kit's KVM.  BFT-A is managed and maintained through the associated PMO. 2.6  A2C2S has Power-0n-Self-Test(POST) Built-In-Test(BIT) capabilities to assist the 31U and the FFSR in performing troubleshooting and repair actions; however, the level at which the POST/BIT and associated troubleshooting matrixes contribute to meeting overall maintenance requirements in questionable. 3.  Program Status - A2C2S is currently in Limited Rate of Initial Production (LRIP) with a total of three Rapid Deployment (preproduction) systems currently in use by the 4ID and 1CAV.  Ten LRIP systems will be built in the next two years.  In the near te rm, the A2C2S will be distributed in pairs at the division level with Operation Iraqi Freedom and Force Modularity initiatives serving as driving factors to the prioritization of gaining units.  Thereafter, Full Rate Production (FRP) is likely to facilitat e the build and field of ten to fifteen systems per year.  The Army Acquisition Objective (AAO) for the A2C2S is 120 systems.   4.  Support Requi rements 4.1  The A2C2S Operational Requirements Document specifies the most binding support requirements in operational terms.  At the system level, A2C2S must be operationally available 90 percent of the time, with an average repair time of 40 minutes.  Operation al Availability (OA) will be used as a performance metric for determining the level of success of the Primary System Integrator (PSI) at any given time.  OA requirements drive support infrastructure contributors such as the technical proficiency of the sup porting technicians, the level of sparing at given location, the repair turn-around time of lower indentured assemblies, and the timeliness of movement of material.  The support integrator will be responsible for meeting the OA through managing all factors  contributing to the calculation.  The methods of OA calculation, contributors to the calculation, and sources for the contributors of the calculation will be agreed to by both the PSI and the government prior to entering into a business relationship. 4.2  For the purpose of this RFI, depot level maintenance is considered to be all maintenance functions above the capabilities of the trained soldier (MOS 31U) within a using unit and includes on-aircraft troubleshooting and repair.  Such an approach meets  the government's intentions to establish a two-level support approach for the A2C2S.  Forward Support Representatives (FSRs) will augment the soldier's capabilities and will be required to be proficient in all A2C2S associated technologies.  The support i ntegrator will be required to become knowledgeable on all other existing and future battle command support resources Digital System Engineers, Logistic Assistant Representatives, Central Technical Support Facility(DSEs, LARs,CTSF, etc.) in order to identif y and take advantage of possible efficiencies. 4.3  A2C2S is a complex integration program utilizing standardized (federally stocked) and nonstandard products (Contractor off the shelf (COTS)); therefore, the support integrator will be responsible for the establishment of support/repair capabilities fo r nonstandard material, pivoting off of established support concepts for both standard and nonstandard material, and in-turn taking measures to mitigate support shortfalls while maximizing the availability of all A2C2S associated items.  Sparing and invent ory management for standard material will be handled via standardized processes.  Organically managed/supported items will be provisioned so that A2C2S populations are considered as part of the overall DA/DOD assest requirements.  Nonstandard items may be stocked/repaired/managed by the PSI using methods that are transparent to the soldier while providing the government with near real time Total Asset Visibility (TAV) of all stocks.  The PSI will be required to develop a storage/warehousing strategy as a pi votal part of the overall support concept.  The A2C2S provisioning conference is scheduled for early in the 2nd QTR of FY05.  Participation of the PSI in the provisioning process in order to influence how materials are managed as part of an overall support  concept is required. 4.4.  The PSI will be required to implement Unique Identification (UID) requirements in support of inventory and transportation requirements IAW current/pending DA/DOD mandates.  UID will be a key contributor to maintaining TAV of all assets, weather in se rvice as part of an active sytem, or in storage as a spare, or during transit.  The PSI will be responsible for establishing material transportation methods that effectively meet movement requirements in support of garrison, training exercise, and continge ncy missions.  UID technologies will be used to track material movements in an end-to-end, factory-to-foxhole manner. 4.5  Responsibility for logistics product (technical manuals and provisioning master record(TMs and PMR)) maintenance, will transition from the OEM to the PSI.  A baseline for each product for the purpose of tr ansition will be established with the assistance of the PSI.  For the purpose of support approach establishment, any logistics analyses previously performed that may be of benefit to the PSI will be made available. 4.6.  Once the business relationship between the Program Management Office (PMO) and the PSI is established, the PSI associated support team members will be included as members of the A2C2S System Support IPT.  Voting membership will be established bilater ally at a later date.  The current IPT includes representation from the PMO,Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), TRADOC, CECOM LRC and AMCOM IMMC. 5.  Business Case Analysis (BCA) 5.1.  The BCA will consider both economic and noneconomic contributors.  Economic contributors will not only include the cost of the services provided by the Forward Support Representative (FSR), but will also consider the costs of associated supply suppor t and transportation methods that in the end contribute to an overall operational availability (OA) of the A2C2S.  Other economic  contributors include the cost of updating logistics product (technical manuals, provisioning records,etc.), the cost associat ed with program management, and the cost associated with any type of initial/capital investment required to implement the overall support approach. 5.2.  Non-economic contributors include the ease in which the business relationship can be initiated and maintained betweeen the PSI and the PMO, the ability of the support provider to maintain consistent support at all user locations during times of peace  and war, the ability of the PSI to integrate service considerations into current/future DA/DOD organic support capabilities and methodologies, the ability to augment these organic support capabilities to better meet A2C2S support requirements, and the abi lity to generate and capitalize on the synergies that can be derived through the support of like items/assemblies/subsystems/systems. 6.0.  Respondents to this RFI are welcome to provide any level of information that is either directly or indirectly related to the information/requirements/descriptions provided above; however, each respondent must provide a single point of contact and ass ociated contact information (telephone number and e-mail address) as part of the information submittal.  The overall intention of the PBL initiative is to provide the PMO with a single integrator for system support, encompassing maintenance services, spari ng, software support, inventory management, transportation, and logistics product updates.  Partnering between private and public entities is viewed as the solution set that could provide the government with a support infrastructure that takes full advanta ge of the best business practices from within the organic army and the commercial world.

<SUBJECT>A--ADVANCEMENTS IN CHEMICAL PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR IN-SPACE APPLICATIONS
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information for planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of chemical propulsion technologies.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than August 23, 2004.  In responding, please reference RFI-NNM04AA01L.  Title:	Advancements in Chemical Propulsion Technologies for In-Space Applications.  Research conducted by the In-Space Propulsion Technologies Project is at the forefront of NASA's efforts to seek new means of enabling faster and more cost efficient missions to the outer planets.  Advanced propulsion technologies are being developed to contend with NASA's unique challenges of enabling missions with fast access throughout the solar system and the ability to rendezvous with, orbit, and conduct in situ exploration of planets, satellites and small bodies.  The information sought is for the advanced chemical propulsion technology area.  Technologies for Earth-to-Orbit missions are not solicited.  This request is not for information concerning flight demonstrations, technologies beyond Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or at development stages less than TRL 3.	The information sought is for the advanced chemical propulsion technology area. Conventional storable chemical propulsion systems have historically been used for primary propulsion and other phases of planetary missions.  The In-Space Propulsion Technology Project seeks, from organizations that have flown chemical propulsion systems on deep space missions, ideas for improving the performance, reliability, cost, and operability of those systems based on their experiences. In addition to "lessons-learned", this solicitation also seeks the identification of mid-TRL technologies that, if matured appropriately, would improve performance, reliability, cost, and operability.  NASA/MSFC's particular interest is information or ideas that address the challenges and issues that advance these technologies from their current state to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, in the near term.	Near-term, for the purposes of this RFI, is on the order of 2-4 years.  This request is not for information concerning flight demonstrations, technologies beyond TRL 6 or at development stages less than TRL 3.  TRL definitions can be found at www.inspacepropulsion.com/when.html.  It is requested that the potential offeror provide a self-assessment of performance, schedule, and system goals for the chemical propulsion technology. Only United States companies/citizens are requested to respond to this announcement.  This solicitation is further limited to those organizations that have recent, extensive experience in the development and operational use of chemical propulsion systems for robotic spacecraft for either extended-duration Earth orbital or interplanetary missions.  Interested parties should submit information not to exceed three pages and a maximum of two resumes (not to exceed two pages each). The format is at the discretion of the potential offeror.  All proprietary information should be marked appropriately.  Responses will be handled accordingly. Comments, ideas, and information may be forwarded to PS52/Betty Kilpatrick via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission to betty.c.kilpatrick@nasa.gov or fax to (256) 544-6062. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.	NASA may, at its discretion, elect to solicit additional information from selected offerors by requesting on-site visits to an offeror’s site.  The purpose for any such visit would be consistent with the guidelines stated herein and would constitute no intent to make an award as a direct result of this Request For Information solicitation.  Any site visits will be properly scheduled and coordinated in advance.  Any questions regarding this announcement should be directed to PS52/Betty Kilpatrick.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?group=C&pin=62 .  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of any further solicitation and/or amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Award
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy, Professional Development Division is having their Annual Interagency Resources Management Conference (IRMCO) which is a Government-wide training conference for about 400 senior Federal, Business, CIO, State, Local and International officials.  IRMCO has been in existence for over 40 years as of the successful training conferences that GSA has conducted to promote and enhance effective information resources management for managers and key personnel in Federal agencies.

To assist in accomplishing this task IRMCO requires audio visual, technical support and expertise to ful fill their requirements for a seemingly distration free conference.

The General Services Administration proposes to award a sole source contract to Swank Audio Visuals, LLC.  The vendor is the audio visual company serving the hotel and has an office on site that will provide support to GSA 24 hours a day.  Through our experience and market reserach, GSA believes that the prices are about the same.  The only difference would be that GSA would have to pay another company to send five or six people, and pay their travel and lodging expenses.  Any other firm desiring consideration must fully identify its capability to perform this requirement within the required timeframe and allotted budget.  GSA plans to make a sole source award to Swank Audio Visuals after fifteen (15) days of the publication of this notice.  Please not that this announcement is not a Request for Proposal and no solicitation will be issued as a result of this notice.

(vi)	Statement of Work

BACKGROUND
The ship’s service and control air compressors on the T-AO 187 Class vessels need to be replaced.  The Nash liquid ring rotary compressor units are inefficient to operate, costly to repair, and maintenance intensive.  MSC requires a replacement for the current models with a more efficient, more reliable type of air compressor that has an economically feasible preventative maintenance program.  The ship’s service air system requires clean, dry, oil-free air to serve various shops, whistles, atomizing, and tool hose services.  The control air system serves various pneumatically operated valves, main engine clutch control, shaft brake, and various control valves.

<DESC>Clarification:The Hand Towels - 145 dozen (4.5#) 16x30.  



Towels being imported or U.S?

 Where the towels are made does not matter, HOWEVER, they need to withstand heavy usage.  There was a company, in the past, lodging purchased towels from and the towels shrunk and started falling apart.  The shrinkage and deteriorating towels lead to the purchase of more towels -- which was a waste!! I have no problems where we get towels from as long as they can withstand heavy usage, laundering and do not deteriorate after 6 months.

<DESC>This is an amendment 0001 to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HHM402-04-Q-0197.  The purpose of this amendment is to make available via the Federal Busines Opportunities websites, questions and answers posed regarding the subject solicitation.

Questions
1.  What is the difference between the three configurations described in paragraph 3.1.1 with three systems, 3.1.2 with two systems and 3.1.3 with one system?  
2.  The systems all appear to be identical with one exception; The handheld programmer unit is listed in 3.1.2 & 3.1.3 but not in 3.1.1 - is this an error?
3.  The Display description are different on the three systems; 3.1.1 is Portable Display, 3.1.2 is Display Unit, and 3.1.3 is Portable Display Unit - are these all the same?  We plan to use a laptop computer such as a Panasonic Toughbook Computer - is this acceptable?
4.  We plan to use an Intensified Light IR Camera - is this acceptable?
5.  You describe different sensors to use with the system but do not specify how many sensors are required.  How many Seismic, Acoustic and Magnetic Sensors are required for each system?
6.  When the cameras are deployed, what is the range from the camera to the target?  How large of a viewing area is required at the range specified?
7.  What type of terrain will this system be used in?  Will the sensors and camera transmitters be located in valleys recording alarms and transmitting to hill/mountain tops and the relays going from mountain top to mountain top (all with line of site)?  8.  What is the range from the Sensor Transmitter to the Relay?  What is the range from the Relay to the Portable Display Unit?
9.  Do you require simultaneous Satellite and local VHF transmission for all alarms and camera images?
10.  For the Satellite communications, do you prefer Iridium or Global Star?
11.  The relays will require a higher power consumption, can solar panels be used at the remote relay sites?
12.  How will the portable display units be used?  Mounted in vehicles, set up in a building, portable hand carried?
13.  What are the requirements for the Hand Held Programmer?  Paragraph 3.2.2 is confusing.  The programmer should be used to program the transmitter.  Is it also a display or is this paragraph mixing up the description of the programmer and display.
14.  What is involved or required in the Integration and Testing in paragraph 3.2.8?  How will the acceptance test and user operational test be performed?
15.  The warranty of one year is no problem.  We will replace and/or repair items that fail due to workmanship or failed components under normal fair, wear and tear.  Any damage due to improper handling or weather is not covered by the warranty.  
16.  Maintenance support at depot level is an issue.  We do not have manuals for depot level repairs.  We can provide service support for damaged or inoperable equipment on an as needed basis.  Will this be acceptable?
17.  Where will the product design review be held?  What is involved/required?
18.  What is the expectation on security in paragraph 5?  Is there a requirement to have a certified secure site and personnel with security clearances?  If so, this will be a major obstacle.
19.  Reports on monthly financial expenditures and progress of the system is required to the contracting officer representative (para 6.2).  Will we also be able to invoice monthly?
20.  Do you have a diagram of the system you are requesting?  If so, can you provide a copy of it?
21.  Last, upon contract award, can we receive a partial payment (10-20%) to assist in purchasing components when the order is placed and the balance after the equipment is delivered?

Answers
1.	There is no significance in the differences in the three configurations. The configurations are a different mix of equipment to satisfy procurement guidelines at the time the announcement was put together. 
2.	The configurations reflect what was intended. 
3.	The three displays are different. As a minimum two of three need to be provided (Remote system display with server and either the hand held and/or portable display. The portable display could be a lap top that meets the appropriate requirements. 
4.	Any item not specifically called out in the announcement should be addressed as an option. 
5.	The number of each sensor directly correlates with the number of processing/transmitter units. Each processor/transmitter unit will have a seismic, acoustic, magnetic and passive IR sensor. 
6.	The vendor will propose the camera that he feels best meets the requirement to include range and how large a viewing area. The vendor can also provide options for different camera configurations. 
7.	The system will be used in a variety of terrain to include desert, forest, valleys and mountains. 
8.	The vendor will propose the radio system that he feels best meets the requirement to include range. The vendor can also provide options for different transmitter configurations 
9.	Both the local network radio transmission (sensors, relays, receivers, etc.) and the satellite transmission should be able to occur at the same time 
10.	There is no preference for Iridium or Globalstar. Either could satisfy the requirement. 
11.	The basic configuration should be based on batteries. Solar panels could be proposed as an option. 
12.	The portable displays could be used either mobile, in a building or carried in a back pack. 
13.	The hand held programming unit could be used as a receiver for receiving alarms, as a transmitter for transmitting data to include GPS location and as a display showing sensor/imaging locations. However, the requirement could be met by the portable display unit in lieu of the hand held. 
14.	Integration should address from a total system approach how the data will be transmitted/received and displayed. Acceptance testing would be a government witnessed test thorough enough to validate all requirements are being met. An operational test would be run by the government to fully test out operation and maintenance. Contractor support would be required in trouble shooting issues, answering questions, etc. 
15.	No answer required 
16.	Contractor provided depot support is acceptable. 
17.	The product design review could be held at the contractor’s facility. The review should cover in detail the design of the components and the system as a whole. The review is an opportunity for the Government to understand the design and for the contractor to get Government advice and direction. The objective of the review is the Governments’ concurrence that the approach will meet the intent of the contract. 
18.	There is no requirement for a cleared facility and to have cleared personnel for this contract. 
19.	Yes.
20.	There is no diagram of the system being requested. The system is intended to be versatile and useable in various configurations. 
21.	No.

T-AO Solicitation N00033-04-Q-8000 Questions:		

·	Is the requirement for (2) 100 SCFM compressors or (2) 200 SCFM compressors?  Item 14a specs the Ship Service Air System at 200 SCFM.
Requirement is for 2 compressors at 200 scfm each.  Each needs to be capable of 100% of normal service.  
·	The dryer package to be installed downstream of the compressors is only to be rated at 280 CFM.  The air system description is for two compressors to be set up on a lead/lag system, which allows for both units to run at the same time for periods of time.  Is the dryer to handle the flow of both compressors?  
No.  As seen in the system drawings, the flow from the compressors goes to 2 air receivers in parallel.  When a second compressor is running, its purpose is to bump up the receiver pressure to system operating pressure.  The flow between the compressors and the receivers would then be 400 scfm.  When the receivers are at operating pressure, the designed flow from receivers to the dryers is 200 scfm.  Therefore, dryer should be sized for 200 scfm, 280 max.
·	If the compressors are 200 SCFM each, shouldn't the dryer be sized for the 400+ flow of both compressors?
See previous response.
·	Does the ship system take air for another usage prior to the dryer?
No, all air passes from the air receivers to the dryer before being distributed to the ship’s service air and control air systems.
·	Do the footprint dimensions, line 4, pertain to both compressors and the dryer combined, or do these dimensions apply to each compressor footprint?  Requirement 8 asks for the dryer package as a separate skid mounted item. 
Line 4 refers to the footprint limits of each compressor only.  
·	Does the weight on item 5 pertain to both the compressors and dryer combined or is that the weight of each compressor?
Line 5 refers to the weight limit of each compressor only.
·	What is the air usage requirement downstream of the dryer?  The dryer is asked to be capable of handling 280 SCFM, but this does not limit loses.  Is this an inlet flow or a discharge flow requirement?  
200 SCFM at 100 psig is the design operating inlet flow condition of the current dryer as originally designed. (280 SCFM max) Current desiccant dryer has 3-5 psig pressure loss.
·	Will membrane dehydrators be an acceptable alternative for a dual canister, desiccant dryer system?
If air quality requirements in RFQ are met, equipment will be acceptable.
·	For the ABS/USCG requirements, what are they?  Which ABS/USCG specs apply, and how do we get them?  Please supply a contact we could discuss the requirements with.
ABS Steel Vessel Rules 2004, Part 4, Vessel Systems and Machinery is available online at www.eagle.org .  Some specific ABS rules that apply include, but are not limited to, section 4-6-7/5.5, regarding control air, and section 4-4-1 may be applicable regarding the fresh water heat exchanger.  Requirements can be discussed further with ABS Americas, Alexandria office at 703-519-0801.
USCG Regulations are covered in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, available online at www.access.gpo.gov .
·	Do the compressors being offered, need to be ABS/USCG approved, in order for the solicitation offer to be considered?  Will compressors that are approved for U.S. Navy ship installation be acceptable alternatives for ABS approved?
The compressor models offered do not have to be pre-approved by ABS/USCG.  However, it must be capable of being approved by ABS upon submittal of unit specifications and a statement that the unit complies with an accepted standard (ANSI, ASME, etc.).  Final testing will also be witnessed by an ABS surveyor at installation.  Prior ABS approval greatly reduces the risk to the government.  U.S. Navy installation improves the government’s confidence in the shipboard application, but is not an alternative to ABS approval.  Note, ABS will review on behalf of the USCG.  
·	What are the ship's pitch and roll requirements for this application? 
Design angles of inclination for shipboard machinery, per ABS Steel Vessel Rules 2004 and 46 CFR are: Athwartship:  15 deg Static, 22.5 deg Dynamic.
Fore-and-Aft: 5 deg Static, 7.5 deg Dynamic.
·	For the central fresh water system on 14b, is 48 GPM flow available to each compressor package or is this the total flow available to be shared by both compressors?
48 GPM is the flow rate available to each compressor.
·	What constitutes a failure. If dew point is one of them then both dryers will need a dew point analyzer. We could do it with one analyzer but we would look at controlling both dryers with one PLC. That may not satisfy the "dual" nature of this request though. 
Dew point being out of spec would constitute a failure.  One analyzer and one controller for two separate dryer elements would satisfy the redundancy requirement.
·	For the dryer, is there any preference for a heated vs. a non-heater dryer?
Preference is for components with less complexity, electrical load, and maintenance burden that meet the requirements of the RFQ. 
·	Are both stainless steel and painted carbon steel acceptable materials for the dryer?
Yes, both are acceptable materials.
·	AIR DRYER PACKAGE:  The "requirements" show dual prefilters and dual afterfilters with "automatic" switching upon element failure.  The standard will be manual valve bypasses.  Element failure means 0 psi drop to me.  But what happens if pressure drop increases above 1-psi?  Also, I noticed on the drawing that the wording says (air dryers, #1&2).  I am assuming that this = one desiccant dryer package with 2 towers? 
The requirements state that the main dryer must have dual elements with automatic switching between the two.  A dessicant dryer with two towers fulfills this requirement.  The total number of prefilters and afterfilters is left to the bidder, so as not to limit the manufacturer's best engineering design and recommendation for the best operation of the system.  If dual prefilters and after filters are used, manual switching between filters is sufficient.  If a single prefilter and single after filter is used, manual bypass valves around the filters are sufficient.  On the existing system diagram provided as GPI, air dryers, #1&2 refers to one desiccant dryer package with 2 towers.
·	OPERATING TEMP:  Temp range is specified as 32F to 120F.  The standard package will go to 115F.  Will this be OK?
The operating temperature requirement is 32F to 120F.  The high end cannot be comprimised, as this temperature is often reached during operation.  A lower temperature rating could result in lower capacity and increased maintenance.
·	ABS/USCG Approved:  We have installed standard product via MSC in VA on-board vessels (as well as other marine applications).  I am not sure how your guys "dealt" with this approval.  Will standard product be OK or will it need to go through ABS/USCG approval??
The product and system as a whole must have the ability to be ABS/USCG approved.  There are specific requirements for control air located in ABS Rules 2004, but the compressor unit itself does not have to be Type Approved.  If similar products from a manufacturer were installed by MSC in the past, then the government has high confidence in ABS approval of this system with that manufacturer's products.
NOTE:  DATE & TIME OF SUBMISSION CHANGE
Offers are due by 1200 hours local time, Friday, 19 March 2004.  Proposals may be submitted via fax (202-685-5965) or email (Elyssa.Parana@navy.mil).
