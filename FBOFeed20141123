<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. 

This announcement is for abstracts only, of approximately five (5) pages or fewer of technical material. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas.  

All technology demonstrations or prototype field tests must be performed in Hawaii, Guam, or Washington State.  However, design, laboratory, and administrative work may be done outside of these locations.
 The proposed technology shall address one of the following two technology areas.  

TOPIC 1:  Alternative Energy Technology.  Innovative alternative and renewable energy technologies are sought that can provide on-site energy generating capabilities to Navy facilities at or below the cost of conventional power.  

A technology may be considered innovative if it:

1) significantly reduces the unit cost of energy acquisition, or
2) significantly increases the annual energy production per unit of area used, or
3) provides energy availability at times when other renewable energy sources would not normally be available. 

Renewable energy includes, but is not limited to, marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy (such as energy from waves, tides and currents in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas), offshore wind energy, waste-to-energy, and hybrid technologies.
 


TOPIC 2:  Energy Storage.  Innovative energy storage technologies are sought to integrate renewable sources at Naval facilities. Energy storage will be evaluated in the context of an enabling technology that supports  renewable energy systems or microgrid management systems.  A technology may be considered innovative if it significantly reduces capital investment,  reduces weight,  increases total storage capacity (kWh), or increases maximum energy discharge rate beyond what is commercially available.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC).  

This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to improve expeditionary logistics, and applies to Navy and USMC forward operating environments (for information on the expeditionary environment, see public material on the Marine Corps Operating Concept, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, and Enhanced MAGTF Operations). NAVFAC EXWC is interested in expeditionary technologies and methodologies that are new, innovative, advance the state-of-the-art, or increase knowledge or understanding. To be eligible for consideration and possible contract award, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any proposed technology or methodology must be 6 or lower.
 

Each submission must address only one of the below areas to be considered.  Multiple submissions are allowed.

TOPIC NO. 1: ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE. Innovative technologies are sought to advance the state of the art in lightweight, mobile infrastructure elements such as shelter systems; bridging systems; power generation, distribution, and monitoring equipment; roadway; and landing pad systems. Technologies may include but are not limited to advanced materials, fabrication techniques, repair techniques, modular construction, power transmission, and intelligent resource allocation systems.

TOPIC NO. 2: ENHANCED SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR WATER. Technologies are sought for the treatment of water in the expeditionary environment, with an emphasis on small-scale systems with production rates of up to 1 gallon per minute.
 Topics of interest include disinfection, filtration, and desalination technologies at both the component and system level. Technologies which minimize weight, cube, energy, and logistics requirements are of interest. These may include: advanced filtration barrier technologies with wide operational envelopes (temperature, salinity, contaminates, etc.), field cleanable filter systems, advanced flow schemes for particle separation, small and efficient desalination technologies, anti-fouling technologies, efficiency improvement schemes, and energy recovery technologies. Innovative water packaging, storage, and distribution technologies will be considered, as will water quality-monitoring systems.

TOPIC NO 3: ENERGY EFFICIENT EXPEDITIONARY FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
 Technologies are sought for increasing the energy efficiency of expeditionary facilities, to include advanced metering, monitoring, planning, and distribution technologies for control of electrical, water, natural gas, and thermal systems. Insulation and thermal management technologies are sought for all types of shelter systems. Technologies are sought to increase the efficiency of environmental conditioning units (ECUs) by more than 10% relative to currently fielded units. Such technologies may include but are not limited to: modifications which can drop in to existing ECUs, advanced vapor compression cycles utilizing coolants with a global warming potential less than 4, advanced dehumidification technologies to decrease the latent cooling load in humid environments, advanced non-vapor compression cycles, and sorption type systems which can utilize low grade waste heat.

TOPIC NO 4: TOOLS AND METHODS TO FORECAST EFFECTS OF ENHANCED TECHNOLOGIES.
 Innovative tools and techniques are sought to investigate the effects of improved logistics technologies and their added capabilities on future expeditionary operations. Such modeling and simulation tools may be used to guide future logistics technology development.

TOPIC NO 5: ENHANCED LOGISTICS TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES. Innovative sensors, prognostic systems, logistics command and control tools and methods, and modeling and simulation technologies are sought to provide improved awareness of inventory and equipment location and condition, as well as supply chain conditions.

TOPIC NO 6: ENHANCED LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION TOOLS. Transportation and supply chain monitoring is critical for all aspects of expeditionary warfare.
 Open architecture software tools are sought for inclusion in an eco-system of intelligent software agents able to reason over semantically enabled transportation and supply chain data. The primary user interface to these tools will be through web browsers and mobile hand-held devices. Modular tools that operate in a service-oriented architecture and can span the full range of logistics and transportation planning in support of expeditionary warfare are of interest.
