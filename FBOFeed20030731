<CONTACT>SANDIE WILLIAMSON CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3032369337     slwillia@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), Golden, Colorado, has a unique mandate to produce rapid estimates of global earthquake location, magnitude, and other source properties.  The USGS, Central Region Hazards Team, Advanced National Seismic Network (ANSS) Project is working towards improving the completeness, reliability, and timeliness of seismic information available for the NEIC, which acts as the national operation center for the ANSS Project.  The ANSS Project in an integrated effort including the extension and maintenance of the real-time ANSS national backbone seismograph network; operational support for automated seismic processing analyst review, and catalog production; development of a new database management system (DBMS) centric automated processing and analyst support system.  The NEIC, maintains a small software development team which develops enhanced near-real-time earthquake processing system for global and regional monitoring, as well as systems for rapid damage assessment in urban areas and structures.  These systems include real-time data acquisition from global and local seismic sensors, automatic detections and characterization of seismic events, storage of event data into an Oracle(r) DBMS, and web-and GUI based tools for human interaction.  The USGS has a requirement for the development and production of the NEIC system that will follow a 'whirlpool' model.  The vendor will be expected to perform specific design and programming tasks in support of the NEIC development, that involve 1) NEIC software high level design, 2) design and development of interactive displays, 3) interfacing to the Oracle database, 4) developing real-time processing software, 5) writing code to add new functionality to the system, 6) enhancing existing code to extend the functionality of the system, 7) testing on prototype system at the NEIC, and 8) user and programmer documentation.  Interactive display development will use Win32 Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Java.  The unique aspect of this design is the human-assisted orientation.  These designs must be designed to improve the response time of the NEIC as well as minimize analyst interactions.  Most of the seismic processing algorithms that will be integrated into the NEIC system will be written in C or C++.  However, it may be necessary to port or integrate Fortran and MatLab code as part of implementing the seismic processing algorithms.  Tasks associated with the seismic processing software include integration of locator, integration of earthworm Mb module with the NEIC processing system, development of the moment tensor module, development of the Mwp module, develop Md and Mblg modules and port the NEIC short period alarm software to the new NEIC platform.  This contract is scheduled for a 12-month base period, with 2 one-year renewal options.  No telephone or fax requests will be accepted.  For technical question contact Sandie Williamson at 303-236-9337.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about August 15, 2003, at the website of http://iedeasec.nbc.gov.  All interested vendors responding to this solicitation should download the solicitation from the website and provide a written response by the due date indicated on the solicitation.  Only written proposals received by the due date will be accepted.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for HubZone under NAICS code 541511.  This is not a commercial acquisition.

<ARCHDATE>07302004
<CONTACT>Tom Leonard Supervisor, Fish Operations /  5095755848256  tleonard@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>NA The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with INTRALOX INC., Harahan Louisiana.  The proposed purchase/ action is to assist The Yakima Field Office (UCA), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR/Reclamation), Department of the Interior in the re fabrication of a rotary fish screening device.Silt problems preside on numerous sites not only in the Yakima Basin but in all areas of the Pacific Northwest. Screen programs have been in search of a material that would withstand the silt abuse for the past 10-15 years.  Even though fish screen / passage is not a new concept with salmonid / anadromous species, it was not until NMFS set specific standards in the 1980's that gave way for the commercial market to experiment with materials that would meet this criteria. This research has made available stainless steel fabrics and coverings that are the most commonly used material, but due to silt and abrasive factors there was a need for a better product. Intralox Corp. has taken the field data and advice from all Northwest Screen Programs and has developed a synthetic interlocking belting product that not only meets NMFS criteria but also meets the demanding need of the environmental conditions of the Pacific Northwest. U.S. Patent # 4,925,016 for Intralox Corp. demonstrates why this is the preferred material for traveling belt screens in the Pacific Northwest. Due to debris and high water velocity the most commercial  belting would dislodge itself from the frame and sprockets causing the screen to become nonfunctional, down time could be from several hours to several days depending on the damage to the belting.  In field maintenance and repair situations this system is invaluable to the laborer, by being able to quickly repair only the damaged piece of belting instead of removing the belting and then making the repair. The intended purchase involves the following parts: 1) Series 1800  10.5"  (13T) sprockets with a  2.5" bore 2)Carbon steel split collar retainers 2.5" 3) Series 1800 belting, flush mesh top black UV resistant acetal / 41' X 83.8"  The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements, better than or equal to Intralox U.S. Patent # 4,925,016. All responses received by close of business August 11, 2003 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a firm-fixed-price, sole source award to Sumaria Systems.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA).  In a project that was completed in June 2003, Sumaria Systems did extensive statistical, economic, and financial analyses that led to its development of a considerable bank of information, expertise and background on the nursery crop insurance program. This new project work that is being contracted for the 2005 crop year is a logical follow-on to the work performed for RMA for previous crop years to update the Eligible Plant List and Plant Price Schedule (EPLPPS), to add plant prices for existing plants and add new insurable plants and prices, and to revise and update insurability information and instructions contained in the EPLPPS. Sumaria’s experience and knowledge of nursery crop insurance processes and procedures is invaluable to RMA in this effort.  There is no other known vendor that can perform the required work without duplication of effort, time and cost.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays to this project.

The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The procurement is for leasing of hardware and network connectivity to access the California State Offender Based Information System (OBIS).  Teale Data Center holds the OBIS contract with the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency of the State of California and is the only source which will satisfy agency requirements.

OBIS network provides detailed and timely information on every inmate in the California State prison system to include biographical data, criminal history, past and current warrants and detainers, history of inmate movement and location within the California Department of Corrections, earliest release date calculations, along with legal status and conviction information from the California Superior Court.   Access to OBIS is controlled by the State of California.

Equipment is currently installed at 13 Federal sites throughout California (may change as mission needs expand throughout the contract period).  This is not a request for quotation/proposal and no quotation/proposal document will be issued.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations (DOE/ORO) intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Museums + More, under FAR Part 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Sources Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Simplified Acquisitions Procedures under FAR Part 13 will be used.  As a federal agency, DOE is responsible for stewardship of the historically and architecturally significant properties of the three Manhattan Project sites located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, under the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. The three Manhattan Project sites are; (1) East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) known as the K 25 Site], (2) the Oak Ridge National Laboratory [ORNL]; and (3) and the Y-12 National Security Complex [Y-12 Plant]).  These sites played an important part to the success of the Manhattan Project. The following Proposed Scope of Work is for the development of an Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) Manhattan Project Strategic Plan which will include Manhattan Project interpretation.  The strategic plan should include recommendations for the design, funding, and implementation of preservation of these facilities within the context of the national significance of the Manhattan Project as a whole.  These include the following: ? Review and assess all previous work packages associated with historic preservation for ORR properties;  the cultural resource survey documents for the three Oak Ridge Sites; and the Atomic Heritage Foundation Manhattan Project ? Draft Interim Report to Congress, etc.; ? Evaluate the Oak Ridge ?Signature Facilities? and other important historic properties from the Manhattan Project era and their contribution to the success of the Manhattan Project; ? Provide recommendations for interpreting the various Oak Ridge Manhattan Project sites at a consolidated location or use of a central facility with satellite interpretive areas/sites; and ? Provide a documented strategy for DOE to manage these ?Signature Facilities? and other important historic properties from the Manhattan Project era since the facilities are aging and are deteriorating and retired workers, people, facilities, and histories are being lost. ? The work product of this task must be closely coordinated with an on-going architectural and engineering study being developed for the ETTP. The work product of this task must be a key component in the Oak Ridge Reservation Manhattan Project Strategic Plan. The ORR Manhattan Project Strategic Plan for the three ?Signature Facilities? must embrace Manhattan Project interpretation and management of other historic properties on the ORR and should include the following components: ? Define DOE?s approach for historic preservation on the ORR; ? Review the facilities which are recommended for preservation/reuse because of their significance; ? Integrate cultural resource management for ?Signature Facilities? among the various ORR programs/sites; ? Recommend a system for coordination between ORR programs; ? Consolidate the ORR story, both for interpretation of the Manhattan Project and other historically significant properties and technologies at ORNL, Y-12, ETTP, and within the City of Oak Ridge; ? Establish the proper procedure and  an approach for collecting and preserving oral historical information utilizing local academic and historical groups as partners plus oral reminiscences of policy makers at the national level; ? Address preservation, storage, and exhibition of ORR artifacts; ? Recommend the proper procedure/approach for completion of thorough documentation of all unclassified interior and exterior features of the signature facilities and other historic properties; ? Recommend the proper procedure/approach for collecting, categorizing, and preserving the unclassified architectural and engineering plans and specifications for the signature facilities and other historic properties; ? Address the establishment of site ?history rooms? at each site to begin collecting important historical documents and photographs ; and ? Evaluate the potential impact on heritage tourism, both positive and negative, as a result of implementation of the ORR Manhattan Project Strategic Plan. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firm?s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why they should be considered, as described above.  All interested firms must respond by 1:00 p.m. (EST), August 15, 2003, to Kay D. Brown, AD-424, U. S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830. Fax No. (865)241-2549.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; price quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is being re-advertised.  The solicitation number is DTCG23-03-B-TMX030R.  The solicitation will be issued as an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  The SIC Code is 4899 and the NACIS is 513340.  The small business size standard is $11.0M.  The period of performance for the base period is twelve months from date of award, with four (4) one (1) year options.  The contract type will be a Firm Fixed Price.  The U. S. Coast Guard has a requirement to implement various telecommunications projects to improve voice and data connectivity to Coast Guard cutters.  The U.S. Coast Guard has a need for a single contractor to provide airtime for Mini-M service.  Currently there are 80 Mini-M terminals in the Coast Guard.  It is estimated that there will be approximately 120 additional terminals installed on assets throughout the Coast Guard.  There will be an estimate total of 200 Mini-M terminals. The number of terminals given is for information planning purposes.  These terminals are only used when cutters are underway which averages about 180 days per year.  International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) is a commercial maritime satellite communications system.  The contractor shall provide airtime services for all INMARSAT Mini-M terminals throughout the Coast Guard.  The Mini-M terminals will use the INMARSAT network for operational voice and data communications.  The Coast Guard also requires Third Generation Secure Telephone Unit (STU-III) voice communications over this system, using the Thrane & Thrane algorithm and requires the Land Earth Station Operator (LESO) to provide this capability.  The contractor shall provide airtime service for Mini-M sea based voice, fax, data, and STU-III services.  The Government will provide up-to-date information of each terminal’s INMARSAT  Subscriber Number’s (ISN’s) and associated phone numbers of all active Mini-M terminals and those that are to be commissioned.  The contractor shall provide accurate monthly billing of Mini-M airtime charges and deliver a copy of the bill to COMDT(G-SCT) within 10 days following the monthly billing cycle. The bill shall include a break down of each terminal’s usage and a summary of the total Coast Guard Mini-M usage.  The Contractor shall provide detailed electronic billing statements that allows for individual tracking of separate Mini-M terminal usage statistics.  This shall include a break down of each terminals usage including the terminals mobile number, date and time of each call, zone called, number called, country call name, service type, duration of call, price per unit and total charge for the call.  There should be a summary page, which lists all Coast Guard terminals and their respective monthly charge and total minutes used.  Typically about 97% of all Coast Guard Mobile Earth Station (MES) originated calls are to the United States Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and are therefore within the INMARSAT Zone 1 coverage area.  The remainder of calls are made up of Zones 2, 3 and MES to MES.  The total number of minutes used per month varies widely and highly depends upon world events.  For the past 7 months the Coast Guard has averaged 11,500 minutes per month.  Based on past performance it is estimated that of the 11,500 total minutes about 11,200 would be from MES to Zone 1 countries (mostly the United States), 100 minutes to Zone 2; 100 minutes to Zone 3; and approximately 100 minutes are MES to MES calls. Bidders are required to use per minute rates; one for each Zone, and one for MES to MES calls.  Use columns for each zone, citing the monthly cost, yearly cost and the total price for the base and four option years. The average minutes are being provided in the sample chart for calculation purposes.  It is required that bidders use this sample chart:(See Attachment 1). The Government will utilize this sample methodology to arrive at the overall lowest rate per
minute. Bidders are to calculate their figures using this methodology for the base and four option years.  Your proposals should be sent to the following address:  Commandant (G-ACS-1B/CL), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.  The Coast Guard will award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder offering the lowest total price.  The Government may reject any or all bids.  The following FAR provisions apply: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-3,Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and     Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders- Commercial Items; 52-217-8, Option to Extend Services; 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.  All bids shall be submitted for bid opening on June 26, 2003 at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  No telegraphic bids are permitted.  For information regarding this synopsis/solicitation, please contact  Ms. Carol Lewis at 202-267-2782 or Ms. Shirley Kyle at 202-267-2514. NOTICE TO OFFERORS/SOLICITATION OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM.  It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time consuming litigation.  Potential offerors who believe that a USCG solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the offeror should then contact the USCG Solicitation Ombusdman at the following address:  Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 Second Street, SW., Washington, DC  20593-0002; Fax: 202/267-4011.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336411 and its size for small business is less than 1,500 employees.  The basic award period of this acquisition is for, Phase-In, a basic period, and four one-year options.  The contract will also include an additional five years of Award Term/Incentive Options that may also be exercised.  The requirement is for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the U.S. Government C-20 fleet of 21 Gulfstream III, IV, and IVSP aircraft as described in the following paragraphs.  These aircraft belong to the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and are designated C-20A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H.  These aircraft are FAA certified and maintained commercial aircraft modified to meet DoD requirements in various specific configurations, and are powered by Rolls Royce Spey or Tay engines.  The C-20 aircraft are located at five Main Operating Bases (MOBs): Ramstein AB GE (C-20H), NAS Sigonella IT (C-20A), Hickam AFB HI (C-20E), Marine Corp Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay HI (C-20G), and Andrews AFB MD 
(C-20B/D/E/F/G).  The aircraft at Ramstein, Sigonella, Hickam, Kaneohe Bay and Army C-20s at Andrews AFB are supported by full CLS (supply and organizational maintenance).

<DESC>The General Services Administration is requesting proposals from electric generation suppliers to provide electric power to various Federal facilities in the State of Maryland in the PEPCO service territory.  The successful offeror will supply electricity and transmission for a contract term of one (1) month beginning with the May 2004 meter read.  A one (1) month extension period is available.  The approximate one (1) month electric requirement is 41,500,000 kWh with 84 MW of peak demand.  The average PEPCO standard offer service generation and transmission rate for the 27 accounts is $0.031/kWh.  GSA anticipates that standard offer service rates at the current level will expire on June 30, 2004.  The procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP) conducted in accordance with Part 12 (Commercial Item) of the FAR.  This announcement constitutes the presolicitation notice only.  The Government intends to award a contract to the offer that offers the greatest discount to the PEPCO standard offer service rates and that meets the solicitation's minimum technical requirements.  DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LOW STANDARD OFFER SERVICE RATE LEVEL AND THE ONE (1) MONTH TERM, THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE COMPLETE SOLICITATION PACKAGES ONLY TO THOSE SUPPLIERS THAT INDICATE INTEREST AND A REALISTIC CHANCE TO BEAT PEPCO'S STANDARD OFFER SERVICE RATES.  Supplier responses of interest to this notice are due no later than 2:00 p.m. on August 12, 2003 at the Contracting Office.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Contact Mr. Ken Shutika on (202) 260-9713 (ken.shutika@gsa.gov) if you have any questions.

<DESC>The University of California, which operates the Los Alamos National Laboratory under contract to the Department of Energy, solicits companies interested in collaborating with Los Alamos National Laboratory in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), sponsored research arrangement and/or to obtain an exclusive or nonexclusive license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market a new                                  Plasma Combustion Technology, hereinafter referred to as “Technology”. The Technology is the subject of an invention disclosure, patent application and U.S. Patents
·	Invention Disclosure entitled “Plasma/Chatalytic Fuel Injector For Enhanced Combustion,” disclosed on September 18, 2003, University Reference No. S-99,956;
·	Invention Disclosure entitled “Combustion Enhancement With Silent Discharge Plasma,” disclosed on October 17, 2002, University Reference No. 100,508;
·	Patent Application No. 10/395,046, entitled “Nonthermal Plasma Processor Utilizing Additive – Gas Injection and/or Gas Extraction,” filed on March 21, 2003, University Reference No. S-100,505; and
·	Patent Application No. 10/395,047 and 10/395,045 entitled “Fast-Pulse Nonthermal Processor,” filed on March 21, 2003, University Reference No. S-100,506.

The technology has broad impact on all combustion process for improving efficiency and for allowing use of lower grade fuels.  By cracking low-grade fuels into smaller molecular fragments, the low-grade fuel can be substituted for a higher grade one.  Also, pre-cracking dramatically improves combustion completeness; especially in lean burn modes of operation, also reducing pollution.  The cracking technology invented at Los Alamos is efficient and only requires minimal energy to provide the cracking chemistry.

Any organization interested in licensing the Technology or in partnering with Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop the Technology for their specific application(s) must respond with a Letter of Interest.  The Letter of Interest should include a statement summarizing the motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  The Letter of Interest is requested by COB August 18, 2003.  Following the execution of a Nondisclosure Agreement, respondents will be provided with technical data that will enable them to evaluate the technology.  Respondents that wish to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a comprehensive business plan or product commercialization plan prior to selection and negotiations. This is not a procurement or grant opportunity.  Please send Letters of Interest to the attention of John J. Russell, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Industrial Business Development Program Office, Mail Stop C334, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545; or email them to [jrussell@lanl.gov].

<DESC>6.3 Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA)

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Ordnance Integration Branch (AFRL/MNMI) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for development and demonstration of an Agent Defeat Munition from firms interested in development of munition systems.  Current inventory hard target penetrators are designed to deliver and detonate a high explosive payload within the interior of hardened structures, such that maximum damage is inflicted on the target structure and it’s contents.  However, this approach against fixed hardened targets associated with the development, production, and storage of chemical (C) agents, biological (B) agents, and CB weapons (CBW) is not desired because of the release of the agents into the atmosphere, which contributes to collateral damage.  A number of studies have shown the need for a penetrating weapon that is capable of delivering an alternative payload within a hardened structure in a manner that minimizes blast overpressure while inflicting damage to the target contents and limiting collateral damage.  The primary goal of the baseline 24-month Shredder Program is to develop and demonstrate a penetrating warhead (BLU 109) with a payload consisting of White Phosphorous and High Explosive (PBXN –109) for use against these fixed hardened targets.  An IDIQ contract type will provide for a 60-month total ordering period and the ability to vary the payload and/or quantities in future Task Orders should additional funds become available.  Please refer to attachments posted at  this site for detailed Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) information.

<DESC>A Presolicitation notice was originally posted indicating other than full and open competition under solicitation number N68936-03-R-0050. That notice has been canceled and is replaced by this notice. The Naval air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA is soliciting Proposals to procure, on a competitive firm fixed price basis, a quantity of one (1) Nanotech 350UPL Diamond Turning Machine System with a 3 axis (X, Z, C) diamond turning machine, integrated Delta Tau CNC controller with NT Windows environment, and temperature stability system under a fixed price contract.  Options if awarded, to be exercised at contract award include work and tool holding fixtures, cutting coolant system, error compensation and surface profilometer system.  This system will be used in a research and development environment to expand the state of the art in diamond turning and ultra-precision grinding technology, therefore, it must be of the highest attainable performance.  Primary uses of this system will be to conduct process research in diamond turning and ultra-precision grinding, and to produce developmental optical components using these techniques.  These optical components will be used in research and prototype visible and infrared systems such as tactical optical aids, range surveillance equipment, and weapons such as guided missiles.  Optical surfaces to be produced by this system include toroidal sections, aspheric surfaces, sinusoidal surfaces, diffractive surfaces, and micro-feature surfaces.  Characteristics critical to above listed applications are a “poured” or cast synthetic granite machine base, and a high performance Precision Instruments Inc. work spindle “C” axis. Critical functions of the pour granite base are form complexity for dynamic performance and built in protection of delicate feedback scales from flood coolant; encoder shielding through “molded in” coolant channels, splash shields and raised encoder bays to prevent contamination by coolant and cutting chips; optimized center of gravity location for improved dynamic stability of the machine; and internal vibration damping with molded vibration isolation mounts points to improve dynamic stability.  Must be ready for operations requiring flood cooling.  Precision Instruments Inc. air-bearing work spindle with integrated 5000 line encoder as the high performance “C” axis, with final resolution of 0.063 arc seconds at speeds up to 2000 RPM, provides angular position feedback necessary for the production of high quality complex optical surfaces, is temperature controlled throughout the motor and bearings to eliminate thermal growth of the spindle and improve accuracy of system, with groove compensated bearings for improved dynamic response. Industry standard Delta Tau motion controller hardware and software with Windows interface for compatibility with auxiliary applications such as Lab View and Mathlab.  Installation and training at Naval Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake will be required.
Award is anticipated in September 2003 and delivery of the system will be due 90 days after contract award. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about 11 August 2003 and will be available through the Contract Competency homepage Website at: https//contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm. The solicitation will close 26 August 2003.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Wilkes Technologies, Inc., Bethesda, MD, for the development of a report on Drinking Water Exposures and Internal Doses of Trihalomethanes in Humans applying the modeling software, "Total Exposure Model" (TEM) to predict contact with chemicals by way of oral, dermal, and respiratory exposure based on information about water use patterns, household activity patterns and characteristics of the household, including, but not limited to, airflow patterns, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The U.S. EPA  National Center for Environmental Assessment believes that Wilkes  Technologies, Inc., is the only known supplier who can provide the required report because only Wilkess Technologies, Inc., has proprietary rights in the "Total Exposure Model" (TEM) software.  Only TEM can model chemical emissions  from water by including specific information on the water appliance-specific use, accounting for both emissions into the air and the residue remaining in water.  Additionally, only TEM includes tha capability to address all three human exposure routes: oral, dermal and inhalation, simultaneously  from the same chemical-containing water supply. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of  the electronic posting of this notice.  Communications may be directed to the POC by e-mail to mccormick.charles@epa.gov. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. The applicable size standard is 500 employees.  This  acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15.  The anticipated award date is 09/01/03.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Dionex Corporation in Sunnyvale, California to furnish, deliver and install a new Ultimate Capillary and Nano-Scale Liquid Chromatograph System and Accessories to the USDA, ARS, NAA, U.S. Plant Soil and Nutrition Lab, Cornell University, 230 Olin Hall, Tower Road, Ithaca, NY 14853.  The Functional & Comparative Proteomics Center (FCPC) subunit's mission is to establish a protein expression profiling capability for the USDA-ARS in the North Atlantic Area.  This requires a liquid chromatography system for the fractionation of complex mixtures of peptides, proteins and other biologically important macromolecules.  This instrument will be used to gain insight into the differential expression of proteins in several species of biological importance.  The system must incorporate the following specifications: The system must be compatible with chromatographic formats that separate based on such sample characteristics as net charge, hydrophobicity, molecular weight and shape and chemical affinity.  The system must be able to accommodate columns with diameters in the range of capillary and nano scale chromatography and deliver accurate and precise flow 
rates (1%) in the range of 50 nl/min - 200 uL/min.  The system must be equipped with a dual LC- gradient system, containing two ternary gradient pumps that can produce two simulations chromatographic gradients in both a parallel and serial format and be compatible with online multi-dimensional liquid chromatography (MDLC).  The system is designed in such a way that delay volumes are minimized to achieve fast gradient responses.  The delay associated with this system operating at 200nl/min is only 3 minutes (600nl).  The system must have definable pressure minimums and maximums that, when exceeded, halt or otherwise terminate the run and alarms that alert the operator that system limits have been exceeded. The system is extremely flexible as it is compatible with all standard formats of chromatography including anion and cation exchange, reverse phase and chemical affinity.  The system includes two low dispersion ten-port micro switching valves, an high precision loading pump with 4 channel solvent organizer, built-in degasser and a solvent selection valve allowing the automatic selection of up to four different solvents. The he system incorporates a column oven that minimizes dead volumes that can control column temperature (+/-) 1 degree C up to 70 degrees C.  The system should involve a micro-scale autosampler that incorporates a dual needle injection technique in which the outer needle is made of stainless steel and is used to pierce the vial/well seal and an inner coaxial needle made from a fused silica capillary tube.  The autosampler should be able to inject minute amounts of sample with minimal sample loss, i.e., it can make 1 uL injections from a 1 uL sample. The autosampler must be compatible with 96 or 384 well plates, micro vials and should be equipped with peltier cooling to protect thermo labile samples.  The complete LC system including autosampler and column switching unit is controlled by a single software package.  The UV detector must be able to read and record four user-selected wavelengths of light simultaneously in the range of 190-740 nm and incorporate an high sensitivity flow cell with an illuminated volume of 3nl. The system can be coupled directly to ion trap mass spectrometers and incorporate a "peak parking" protocol that extends the MS/MS interrogation time.  The Probot microfraction collector included with this system is programmable and allows for different modes of fraction collecting including: collection directly on MALDI targets, collection in micro well plates or micro vials and in a dual collection mode where a user selected portion is spotted to a MALDI target and the remainder is collected in a multi-well plate.  The Probot is compatible with a large selection of commercially available MALDI targets including ABI 4700 and Bruker Biflex targets.  The system software is fully compliant with GMP and cGMP requirements, records all relevant chromatographic details and documents each run exhaustively.  The post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions are included in the  software and involves dynamic data displays, a relational database and is compatible with 3-D analysis.  The system is fully compatible with commercial software such as MicroSoft Excel.  The system has a small footprint and occupies 5.5 ft. of bench space.  Includes a one-year parts and labor warranty which begins upon the Government's acceptance.  Installation and training are provided at no additional charge.  Furthermore, telephone support for technical and application problems is available for free.  In addition, a one-year parts and labor warranty on the equipment is required and information on extended warranties and the costs.  Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide and service such equipment, warranty must submit a written substantive statement outlining the Company's and systems' capabilities, available service agreements and consumables (including price lists) to the Contracting Officer within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a firm fixed price award to the National HBCU Network for Health Services and Health Disparities Research, 11107 Maiden Drive, Bowie, Maryland 20720.  The National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Research Network for Health Services and Health Disparities will subcontract with Alcorn State University, Lorman Mississippi and other entities as program participants to carry out a community based diabetes self management education program for use in the African American community in Lorman, Mississippi. Approximately 400 persons from this site will participate in the program.  The program should target African American adults (males and females) 45 years and older diagnosed with diabetes or at high risk of developing the disease.  The goal of this procurement is to develop an understanding of the effectiveness of community-based diabetes self-management education upon members of the African American community. According to the literature, such programs have been shown to be generally effective, but depend upon collaborative models of care.  The objectives of the contract are to: 1) determine the knowledge of participants about the disease process of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), 2) identify the knowledge of African Americans with DM about self management of the disease, 3) provide information about the disease process of DM, 4) Discuss the risk factors for developing DM, 5) Describe strategies for self management and preventing complications of DM, 6) determine access to care among African Americans with DM, 7) describe strategies for self management and preventing complications of DM, and 8) measure the impact of the project by developing a follow-up evaluation at 3 and 6 months after the intervention to determine their progress on the participant’s behavior associated with current attitudes and practices for addressing disease management.  The perspective of an HBCU contractor is needed, especially to insure that questions are asked with sensitivity to issues of race and culture, as well as to insure a sophisticated understanding of the different effects of race, culture, and socio-demographic variables.  During this critical time when diabetes in the African American community continue to increase, it is essential that HBCU health services researcher(s) take a lead role in investigating the continuing determinants of this disparity.  For example, HBCU investigators live and work in the community and know that the problem of health disparities is not new.  The ability to conduct baseline studies, long-term follow-up, risk factor identification, health education interventions; identification of socio-cultural factors affecting health, ethnic influences, and measurement of health outcomes, contribute to the uniqueness of HBCU researchers.  The academic intellect currently available within the faculty and accessibility to the target population is an ideal combination needed to assist CMS and other government agencies to achieve their objectives.  The HBCU Network is a consortium of HBCU investigators with the capacity to conduct health services research and programs such as the one envisioned here. Making the award to the consortium affords the agency the maximum flexibility in terms of the appropriate number and location of sites. Making the award to a single entity also reduces the fixed costs associated with the program design phase of the project. Therefore, a noncompetitive purchase order is justifiable for an award to the National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Network for Health Services and Health Disparities to carry out the Statement of Work for the Conference – “Research Conference – Improving Health Outcomes and Health Disparities: Research and Intervention Perspectives.”  A major factor for the sole source justification is that this
 organization is addressing a health area that CMS is concerned about.  The National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Research Network for Health Services and Health Disparities (The Network) was established in 1996 through a collaboration between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’(CMS) Office of Research,Demonstration, and Information (ORDI) and HBCUs in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. The Network is a non-profit organization established for the purpose of promoting opportunities that increase the capacity of HBCUs to develop and conduct quality health services research and outreach activities that address the health needs of African Americans.  CMS’s Office of Research, Development, and Information staff person determined that the assistance of this HBCU contractor will provide creditability and knowledge about diabetes in the African American community, imperative to CMS and that the proposed individual has unique skills, experiences, and capability to carry out the intent of this project.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<SUBJECT>S -- Privatization of Natural Gas Distribution and Wastewater Collection Systems at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas and wastewater infrastructure systems at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. System Descriptions: Natural Gas and Wastewater.  The base size is approximately 4,524,064 square feet, which includes 365 buildings and 874 military family housing units. Luke has it’s own wastewater treatment plant. The natural gas distribution system is supplied to Luke Air Force Base at three separate locations by 175 pound per square inch gauge gas mains owned by Southwest Gas Corporation. The natural gas piping on the main base is almost entirely polyethylene (PE). Steel piping is located in the Military Family Housing area. The piping is coated, rather than wrapped, and includes a cathodic protection system. The system contains 19 rectifiers. There is no physical on-base production of gas or natural gas wells. The meters owned by the Air Force are used for billing purposes. The Air Force-owned distribution system consists of approximately 119,000 linear feet of underground piping. The majority of the piping is less than 20 years old, with some as old as 50 years. The wastewater collection system consists of three major components; the sanitary sewer collection system, the wastewater treatment plant, and non-potable water reuse system. The sanitary sewer system consists of the gravity mains, cleanouts, lift stations, force mains, and access manholes associated with the collection of sanitary sewer from the facility buildings and family housing on the base. A majority of the gravity collection mains and service laterals were installed in the 1940’s when the base was first constructed and in the 1950’s and 1960. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are Cast Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. In the late 1970’s, additional base housing was installed. The gravity collection mains installed during these construction periods are composed primarily of Reinforced Concrete Pipe, the force mains are cement Mortar Lined Ductile Iron, and the service laterals are Vitrified Clay Pipe. Since the 1980’s, the base has made a concerted effort to install PVC for all sanitary sewer piping that are 8 inches or less. Consequently, most of the gravity mains, force mains and service laterals in these areas are composed of PVC. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed during the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s are in fair to good condition. A majority of the gravity collection mains, force mains and service laterals installed in the 1970’s, 1980’s and 1990’s are in good to excellent condition. The wastewater treatment plant is designed to accept all of the sanitary flow from the sanitary sewer collection system through a 21-inch reinforced concrete pipe main line flowing from the site. Major improvements were conducted in 1994 to provide an advanced wastewater treatment plant that consistently met effluent discharge limitations and provide reuse water for discharge to the base golf course and parks for irrigation purposes. Improvements were designed to allow the facility to effectively treat an average daily flow of 1 million gallons per day with removal efficiencies in excess of 95% or better for Biochemical Oxygen Demand and suspended solids. The wastewater treatment plant has a certified laboratory capable of performing both process control and process monitoring tests. Since most of the wastewater treatment plant equipment was installed or reconstructed in the 1994 improvements, its overall condition is good to excellent. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  The cascading source selection method permits small and large businesses to submit offers.  Offers from small businesses will be considered first. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for award to a small business concern are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available on or after August 15, 2003 LINKURL: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246 LINKDESC: http://www.desc.dla.mil EMAILADD: Robert.E.Jones@dla.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a contract with an estimated period of performance of five years. The purpose of the Access to Credit Project is to mobilize credit for the use of small and medium businesses, prospective homeowners, farmers and municipalities. The core components of this project will be in the areas of mortgage lending, municipal bonds, and financial leasing. The central activities will include developing an appropriate legal environment; developing training programs to build a knowledgeable cadre of financial professionals and the development of appropriate financial products to meet the needs of the Ukrainian SMEs, agriculture, and municipalities.  As a result of this project, entrepreneurs will be able to borrow against the value of their homes to provide capital for their businesses, a new generation of Ukrainian citizens will be able to own their own homes, farmers will be able to finance their agricultural production and municipalities will be able to upgrade their infrastructure and services. In addition, Ukrainian banks and non-bank financial institutions will have a greater capacity to make business and home loans.  Award will be made using the procedures in FAR Part 15 under Full and Open Competition. The NAICS Code for the proposed award is 941990. The solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) no sooner than 15 days from the date of this notice. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued.

<DESC>NA This is a modification to Notice of Contract Action originally posted 30 July 2003.  This modification corrects the date of issuance of the solicitation to a date on or about  15 August 2003. (see below)  The Government intends to award a contract for up to 314 Wind Sensor Modification Kits with two options for 100 additional kits each to Coastal Environmental Systems, Seattle, WA for a period of 4 years (inclusive of options) from FY 04 through FY 08. The kits are designed to provide an interface between legacy wind indicators, nomenclature AN/FMQ-13, and a newer RM Young wind sensor.   The Wind Sensor Modification Kit is described in paragraphs 1.0 to 5.0:  1.0 Physical Description.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall consist of: An RM Young wind monitor; Electronics to translate the signals from the RM Young into the correct protocol to respond with the data required from the legacy AN/FMQ-13 indicator; a compatible Bell - 202 modem; a power supply; a terminal strip for existing power and communications cables to connect to the cable from the enclosure to the RM Young; and an Enclosure for the electronics interface components.  The Enclosure for the electronics interface components shall be pole mounted in the same configuration as the existing AN/FMQ-13 wind monitor.  2.0 Interface Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall interface to the following legacy FMQ-13 equipment: Digital Display Indicator ID-2408/FMQ-13(V) and Wind Direction and Speed Recorder RO-588/FMQ-13(V).  3.0 Accuracy Requirements.   The wind range of the wind speed sensor shall be 0-115 knots, with an accuracy of  +/-1 knot (0-24kts) and +/- 10% above 24kts.  Resolution shall be 1kt.  The wind direction accuracy shall be within 5 degrees.  The resolution shall be 10 degrees (0 to 359 degrees). The wind direction sensor shall be aligned to true north.  After removing the sensor from its mounting for maintenance, the sensor design shall enable the accurate restoration of directional alignment without the necessity for another alignment survey.  The sensors shall be sampled at a rate sufficient to provide five-second averages.  4.0 Environmental Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall meet the following environmental requirements: Operating Temperature: from -62 *C to +54 *C; Storage/Transport Temperature: from -51 *C to +60 *C;  Relative Humidity: 0% to 100%.;  Wind:  Up to 115 knots;  The wind speed and direction sensors shall operate within the accuracy requirements specified, during conditions of 0.25-inch radial thickness of clear ice and wind speeds higher than 10 knots.  5.0 Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall be electromagnetically compatible within itself and with other systems in its operating environment.  The operational performance shall not be degraded by electromagnetic environmental effects (E3).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This contract action represents a contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than Coastal Environmental Systems would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. In addition, the Contractor must be able to produce up to 30 systems a month for the life of the contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 15 August 2003.  Award of this contract will be made on or about 21 November 2003. Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above. See Notes 22 and 26.

The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall meet the following environmental requirements: Operating Temperature: from -62 *C to +54 *C; Storage/Transport Temperature: from -51 *C to +60 *C;  Relative Humidity: 0% to 100%.;  Wind:  Up to 115 knots;  The wind speed and direction sensors shall operate within the accuracy requirements specified, during conditions of 0.25-inch radial thickness of clear ice and wind speeds higher than 10 knots.  5.0 Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.  The AN/FMQ-13 Wind Sensor Modification Kit shall be electromagnetically compatible within itself and with other systems in its operating environment.  The operational performance shall not be degraded by electromagnetic environmental effects (E3).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This contract action represents a contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than Coastal Environmental Systems would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. In addition, the Contractor must be able to produce up to 30 systems a month for the life of the contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 15 August 2003.  Award of this contract will be made on or about 21 November 2003. Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above. See Note 22.  See Note 26.

 On January 2, 2003 the Social Security Administration published an Initial Public Announcement for an A-76 Full Cost Comparison Study for Information Technology Help-Desk Services In the FedBizOps forum (Reference Number: SSA-A76-HELPDESK). This posting is a modification to that initial public announcement for the purpose of notifying interested parties that this project, which was previously being conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, has now transitioned to a Standard Competition under the procedures of the Revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  The following information required by the revised circular is being added to the original announcement. The incumbent service provider currently performing the activity under study is the Social Security Administration/ Office of Systems. The activity under study is currently provided at the Social Security Administration’s headquarters in Woodlawn, MD and at six Remote Operations Communications Centers located in: Philadelphia, PA; Richmond, CA; Birmingham, AL; Jamaica, NY; Chicago, IL; and, Kansas City, MO. At the time of this announcement the number of Government personnel (FTEs) performing the activity is sixty-four (68). These incumbent Government service provider FTEs are augmented by private sector contractor staff numbering forty-seven (47) persons. All of the Government FTEs and contractor personnel identified herein are subject to this A-76 study. The Competitive Sourcing Officer (CSO) for this A-76 study is Jo Anne B. Barnhart. The Agency Tender Official (ATO) for this A-76 study is Kelly Croft.  The Contracting Officer for this A-76 study is Eileen Keating Carnaggio.

<ARCHDATE>10142003
<CONTACT>Kathryn Terry, 919/549-4337
<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought synopsis to determine availability of basic technology applicable for the generation of adaptable tactical behaviors for unmanned ground vehicles.   There is no solicitation at this time.  The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is  conducting the Army's applied research program for future unmanned ground vehicle systems.  ARL's Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance, a consortium of academic and industrial organizations is an integral part of this effort.  The program is focused  upon developing perception, intelligent control and human-machine interface technologies for unmanned elements of the Objective Force, including Future Combat Systems (FCS) and Land Warrior (LW).   These systems will conduct multiple military missions in complex, highly dynamic tactical environments.  To date the program has been highly successful in developing technology necessary to implement point-to-point autonomous mobility in unstructured off-road environments. It has implemented this technology on a  number of roughly HMMWV sized (3500 lb gross weight) testbed vehicles capable of achieving speeds in excess of 20 MPH during cross-country operation. It has developed initial, primitive behaviors utilizing a case based structure.  The program recognizes t hat to be highly successful in unstructured, dynamic tactical environments it must significantly increase the adaptability and flexibility of these behaviors, beyond that heretofore demonstrated in practical ground unmanned vehicle systems.  Adaptable beha viors will (1) recognize dynamic changes in the environment and/or tactical situation and (2) utilize a combination of a priori and contextual information together with organic sensor data to modify or regenerate plans in real-time in a manner appropriate to achieving overall goals under the revised circumstances.  These behaviors may involve multiple heterogeneous unmanned systems, including combinations of air and ground vehicles. ARL is seeking sources of basic approaches that will enable the development  of adaptable tactical behaviors, as previously described.  Respondents to this announcement are requested to submit a white paper, no longer than two (2) pages, generally describing their approach towards the generation of adaptable behaviors, together wi th available evidence concerning the performance of this approach.  These whitepapers will be reviewed by ARL, ARL support contractors, and member organizations of the ARL Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance.  Respondents are cautioned that these wh itepapers will be reviewed by non-government personnel and proprietary information should not be included.  Based upon these whitepapers, ARL may extend invitations to participate in a September/October 2003 workshop held to further discuss these approache s.  POC for this activity is Jon Bornstein, (410) 278-3737.  Respondents to this announcement should submit whitepapers to Ms. Chandra Bizzell, Robotics Program Office (Titan Systems Corporation), U.S. Army Research Laboratory, ATTN: AMSRL-WM-RP, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5066, not later than Friday, 15 August, 2003.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought. This announcement in no way obligates the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise make a contract awar

<DESC>CLS FOR C-20 AIRCRAFT FLEET
Potential Source Sought


Description:
This is a Small Business Set-Aside Acquisition. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The U.S. Air Force through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is conducting research to determine the existence of potential business sources interested in providing support for the U.S. Government C-20 fleet of 20 Gulfstream III, IV, and IVSP aircraft as described in the following paragraphs beginning 01 Nov 2003.  These aircraft belong to the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and are designated C-20B/C/D/E/G/H.  These aircraft are FAA certified and maintained commercial aircraft modified to meet DoD requirements in various specific configurations, and are powered by Rolls Royce Spey and Tay engines.  They are configured to accommodate 12 to 14 passengers and a crew of five.  The C-20 aircraft are located at four Main Operating Base (MOBs): Ramstein AB GE (C-20H),  Hickam AFB HI (C-20E), Marine Corp Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay HI (C-20G), and Andrews AFB MD (C-20B/D/E/G).  The aircraft at Ramstein, Hickam, Kaneohe Bay and Army C-20s at Andrews AFB are supported by full CLS (supply and organizational maintenance).  Partial CLS (supply support only) is provided for Navy and Air Force C-20s at Andrews AFB.  The Navy provides their own organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB and the Air Force replaces their organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB with a base contractor that is not associated with this contract.  Spare parts and support equipment maintained in the Contractor Operated and Maintenance Base Supply (COMBS) located at each MOB are government-owned.  The COMBS at Andrews AFB provides supply support to all the C-20s based at Andrews.  In addition to the MOB supply and maintenance support, the new contract will include a requirement for depot maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) and depot field team support worldwide for the C-20 airframe, engine, accessories, and avionics.  The depot support shall include all inspections and maintenance required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the government (DoD and FAA).  The depot maintenance requirement will also include complete airframe paint removal, corrosion control and repaint, as required by the applicable service, as well as security for all C-20 aircraft in depot.  The government requires the contractor to provide a detailed critical path delivery schedule for all aircraft inducted for scheduled depot maintenance.  Delivery schedules will also be required for long-term unscheduled depot maintenance.  These schedules will be required within minimum times after aircraft induction.  Source interested in this requirement should express this in writing to: OC-ALC/PSKBB; ATTN: Rhonda Provence; 3001 Staff Drive Ste 1AC4 106A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020; fax (405) 739-2378.  Email address: Rhonda.Provence@tinker.af.mil.  No telephone requests.  Only written, faxed, or via e-mail requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.

No further information on this system requirement will be provided. All responses are requested to indicate if they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, or HUB zone small business.

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request.

<DESC>The Government is seeking potential sources to provide husbanding services in support of U.S. Government vessels visiting various non-government ports within the Continental United States (CONUS) from Maine to Texas under as few as one or as many as three contracts for husbanding services.  The husbanding contract(s) would be inclusive of all ports within those regions as defined by the U.S. Navy to be CNRNE (Commander, Navy Region Northeast), CNRMA (Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic), and CNRSE (Commander, Navy Region Southeast). 

The contract(s) would be requirements type that is required to be used by all U.S. Navy ships (USS) and is authorized for use by all other Military Sealift Command ships (USNS) or MSC pre-positioned chartered vessels, U.S. Coast Guard Ships (USCGC) and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ships, and other U.S. Government vessels. The contract(s) are contemplated to be awarded for a base year, with provisions for four one-year option periods.  The United States Government also authorizes the pricing contained in the contract for use by foreign vessels visiting these ports on official invitation. The place of performance would include all commercial ports within CONUS from Maine to Texas. 

Vessels expected to utilize the resultant contract include Class I (small craft ships with 40 crewmembers or less) up to Class V (aircraft carriers).  Services will consist of, but are not limited to trash removal, collection/holding/ transfer (CHT) sewage removal, waste oil and aggregate water removal, fresh potable water, pilotage, tugboat services, linehandler services, crane services, brow (gangway) rental, cargo drayage/free time/demurrage/ detention services, water taxi services, vehicle rental (sedans and buses), paint float rental, forklift services, telephone services (landline and cellular), and force protection as detailed in the statement of work. 

Initially, only certain high use ports, deemed high use based on historical data indicating frequency of visits and length of stay, will be specifically and separately priced.  The ports that may be specifically identified in the regional contracts are Boston, MA; New York, NY; Annapolis, MD; Baltimore, MD; Wilmington, DE; Philadelphia, PA; Charleston, SC; Savannah, GA; Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale), FL; Palm Beach (West Palm Beach), FL; Port Canaveral, FL; Miami, FL; Tampa, FL; Panama City, FL; and Mobile, AL.  All other commercial ports from Maine to Texas, not otherwise priced, would be stratified into zones based on commonalities in fixed pricing.  Zones will include a number of ports, and stratification may be based on cost drivers (i.e. region, specific location, port size, and/or capability.)  The contractor is requested to identify the possibilities of zonal pricing below.  The remainder of costs for those unspecified ports would be negotiated between the Government and the regional contractor in advance of the port visit, with the contract modified to reflect this addition to the specific pricing structure.

Potential offerors that are interested and capable of providing geographically dispersed husbanding services are requested to 

·	Evaluate and suggest possible alternatives to our proposed contract structure and selection of ports to be specifically priced.  
·	Identify those CLINS in the attached spreadsheet that could be fixed priced on a regional or zoned basis for ports that will not be specifically delineated in the pricing structure (for example, Husbanding Services - First Day, Husbanding Services - Subsequent Days).  Previous port visit sites that will not be specifically priced in these contracts are provided as a sample of potential ports to which this zoning might apply.
·	Provide Company name, POC, voice/fax number, e-mail address, and brief company profile (maximum 2 pages) detailing Husbanding Services experience of a similar nature not later than 15 August 2003 to the Husbanding Services Program Manager at e-mail: William.shearer@navy.mil, with cc to Ms. Sarah Chambers at e-mail: sarah.chambers@navy.mil and LCDR Teddie Dyson at e-mail:  teddie.dyson@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential sources capable of performing the proposed work.  It is anticipated that a Contractor will be required for the Development of Performance Based Seismic Design Guidelines/Project Initiation.  One of the critical issues now facing the earthquake engineering field is being able to quantify the performance of structures designed and built to earthquake design codes.  This includes the NEHRP Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings and Other Structures, which was first developed by FEMA in 1985, and has been updated every three years following a consensus process.  This now serves as the basis for the seismic portions for all the nation’s model building codes.  Presently, seismic code requirements are based on ‘life safety’ which means their goal is to prevent loss of life by preventing the collapse of or serious damage to the building.  The development of performance based seismic design guidance is the next step I the field of earthquake resistant design.  It is anticipated that the effort will be extensive undertaking that will require an organization that is capable of bringing together the nation’s experts in a large number of fields, including structural engineering, architecture, geo-technical engineering, mechanical engineering, systems engineering and non-structural engineering design.  Equally important, this effort will also require the input of experts from the user community, including, but not limited to building owners and managers, insurance companies, risk managers, financial institutions, lawyers, state and local regulators, and elected officials.  Minimum capabilities must include documented evidence of experience and expertise in all of the following areas: (1) new engineering tools; (2) demonstrated experience in bringing together top experts from many disciplines needed to improve existing engineering tools; (3) demonstrated ability to attract engineering experts and coordinate efforts; (4) demonstrated experience bringing together other various groups that represent the users of the technology; (5) demonstrated experience in the development of user-friendly resources and engineering applications to mitigate the effects of natural and other hazards on the built environment; and (6) demonstrate experience in bringing the nation’s experts in a large number of fields, including structural engineering, architecture, geo-technical engineering, mechanical engineering, systems engineering and non-structural engineering.  Firms with these capabilities are invited to submit complete information to the procuring office identified in this notice in three (3) copies within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this notice.  Information furnished should include: (1) the number and professional qualifications of scientists, engineers, technical and other appropriate personnel; (2) company experiences related to the proposed project; (3) a description of general and special facilities; (4) a current financial statement; and (5) other literature which demonstrates minimum capabilities listed above.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small or minority-owned businesses.  If the evaluation of responses received concludes that none of the responding firms have the necessary capabilities, negotiations may be conducted with Applied Technology Council on a noncompetitive basis.

<SUBJECT>76 -- LESSON PLANS / PORTABLE BUSINESS STARTUP PROGRAM
<DESC>These are questions from a potential offeror regarding the synopsis/solicitation that was posted on 25 Jul 03. 

All government responses are in CAPITALS

1.Is this intended to be a fixed price quote for creating this material? 

 I AM REQUESTING A FIXED PRICED QUOTE NEGOTIATIONS WILL NOT BE CONDUCTED.

 2. Is there an expected cost range?   
              
THERE IS AN EXPECTED COST RANGE HOWEVER I CANNOT DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION. I EXPECT ALL POTENTIAL VENDORS TO STICK TO THE SPECIFICATIONS AND IF COMPETITION IS NOT RECEIVED THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL RE-ISSUE THE SOLICITATION WITH FURTHER SPECS. THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING AWAY FROM TELLING CONTRACTORS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT FROM A TO Z, WE NOW JUST PROVIDE VENDORS WITH A DESCRIPTION AND ALLOWING TO USE THERE OWN EXPERTISE. 

Discussion: There are huge ranges of production quality in training. These include formats of materials, lengths of textbooks/workbooks, quality/quantity of classroom handouts, type of instructors (experts versus facilitators), depth of research, use of outside experts, and detail level of lesson plans. 
 
Question: Assuming that the budget range is not available is there some other way to give us an indication of the project expectations and assumptions? 
 
PROJECT EXPECTATION IS FOR VENDOR TO PRODUCE A FACILITATOR'S GUIDE WITH DETAILED LESSON PLANS FOR EACH SESSION AS WELL AS AN ACCOMPANYING CARRY AWAY TEXTBOOK FOR THE MOBILE MILITARY SPOUSE.  THE COURSE SHOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE SUGGESTED CONTENT, HANDOUTS TO BE COPIED FOR CLASSROOM EXERCISES AND A CD OF OVERHEAD PROJECTIONS FOR INSTRUCTORS TO USE IN CLASS.  STUDENT BOOK SHOULD BE A "WALK-AWAY" RESOURCE TO HELP THE SPOUSE SET UP A HOME BASED BUSINESS FROM THE START-UP TO MAINTAINING THE BUSINESS TO CLOSING UP THE BUSINESS TO MOVE TO NEXT BASE.  WE EXPECT QUALITY, IN DEPTH RESEARCH AND DETAILED LESSON PLANS. 
STIFF COVER PAGE
WHITE BOND TEXT PAGES
STANDARD (TIMES NEW ROMAN, ARIAL, ETC) TEXT STYLE THROUGHOUT

3.   Do we have the ability to modify the outline if we feel additional items would benefit the student? 
            
NO. THE GOVERNMENT ONLY WANTS WHAT I HAVE REQUESTED.
 
4.   Are there any guidelines for writing the proposal? 
 
THE PROPOSAL SHOULD CONSIST OF 4 LINES ITEMS AS THERE BROKEN DOWN IN THE SOLICITATION ON (WWW.EPS.GOV) AND THE REPS AND CERT (52.212-3)


 
5.   Are the copyright issues negotiable? 
 
             NO.
 
6.   Is this course to be delivered in a classroom or as self-study materials?  

BOTH. 

Discussion: In your response you stated that the course should be both classroom and self-study. We realize that 80% of the development effort is the same but delivering both formats would require additional effort. Lesson plans with the assumption of expert instructor are very different than self-study or facilitated classrooms. 
 
Question: Since these have very different design considerations does this mean that you actually want two courses with as much shared content as possible? 
NOT TWO COURSES.  ONE PROGRAM WITH FOUR COURSES AND ACCOMPANYING LESSON PLANS FOR EACH SESSION IN A FACILITATOR'S GUIDE WITH OVERHEAD A/V SLIDES AND APPROPRIATE ACCOMPANYING HANDOUTS.  THE FACILITATOR'S GUIDE SHOULD FOLLOW THE STUDENT BOOK ACCORDINGLY.  THIS SHOULD BE A SELF CONTAINED COURSE THAT WORK/LIFE CONSULTANTS CAN PRESENT IN A FORMAL CLASSROOM SETTING AND ALSO PULL FROM FOR ONE ON ONE CONSULTATIONS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES DESIRING A HOME BASED BUSINESS.
IF YOU ARE STILL INTERESTED, PLEASE SUBMIT A PROPOSAL BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS (4PM) 8 AUG 03.
AS STATED, SAMPLE WORK MAY BE REQUESTED AND/OR SUBMITTED WITH THE PROPOSAL. BASICALLY WE JUST WANT THE LANGUAGE, STRAIGHT FORWARD AND PLAIN – NOTHING FANCY AND OVERRATED.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE LESSON TO COVER IS MENTION IN THE SOLICITATION. 
PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU!

<SUBJECT>C --  Notice of Intent Changing catagory R to Catagory C - A&E
<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Indiana is seeking qualified A&E firms or individuals to develop Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs).  The work shall consist of providing a technical assistance to Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) participants for the development of these plans. A CNMP is a grouping of conservation practices and management activities for animal feeding operations (AFOs) which, when implemented as part of a conservation system, will help ensure that both production and natural resource protection goals are achieved.  A CNMP incorporates practices to 1) Use animal manure, process wastewater and other organic by-products as a beneficial resource;  2) Address potential impacts of an AFO on natural resources, especially water and air quality; and  3) Assist an AFO owner/operator in meeting all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal water quality goals or regulations.  NRCS has identified a need to develop up to 20 CNMPs for AFO facilities of EQIP program participants over the duration of this project.  The facility locations are distributed throughout Indiana as shown below by counties:  Allen, Decatur, Dubois, Hamilton, Knox, Kosciusko, Lake, Noble, Perry, Rush, Starke, and Switzerland.  CNMPs shall be developed in accordance with all applicable NRCS policy and criteria which can be found at the following websites:  NRCS Comprehensive Nutrient Management Planning Technical Guidance: http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov/scripts/lpsiis.dll/H/H_180_600_E_5.htm
NRCS Field Office Technical Guide: http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov
CNMP development will require knowledge of conservation planning; an understanding of agronomy, engineering, soil conservation and water management practices; and good communication skills.  The respondents must be certified as a Technical Service Provider (TSP) for at least the 3 primary components of a CNMP, Manure and Wastewater Handling, Nutrient Management and Land Treatment or have the ability to subcontract with someone who holds the appropriate certifications.  Details on certification as a TSP can be found at: http://techreg.usda.gov   For more information about the technical requirements of this project please contact: Phil McLoud, Asst. State Conservationist, telephone: (317) 290-3200 Ext: 348.  Email address is: Phil.McLoud@in.usda.gov  Interested parties should submit 3 copies of their SF254 and SF255 to the Contracting Officer as well as any information that will assist the A&E Evaluation Board with their evaluation on the selection criteria.  The selection criteria are: 1) Professional Qualifications,  2) Specialized experience and technical competence,  3) Capacity to accomplish work,  4) Past Performance,  5) Location in the area and knowledge of the project.  Multiple contracts may be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  More than one contract may be awarded within a watershed boundary.  Each contract will be an IDIQ contract.  When submitting a response to the notice, indicate which watershed(s) you would be interested in being considered.  Projects will be ordered on an as-needed basis beginning from the date of contract award for a period not to exceed three years.  Even though some watersheds have no anticipated CNMP development as indicated in the above quantities, future needs might result in projects located in those counties.

<SUBJECT>67 -- School Bus Digital Surveillance System
<DESC>SCHOOL BUS DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

Request for Information Only - DO NOT SEND PROPOSAL: Closes 11 Aug 03. 

The Department of Defense Dependent Schools Pacific (DoDDS-P) Procurement Division located in Okinawa Japan is issuing a request for information (RFI) seeking sources and product information for a digital surveillance system (video & audio) for possible use in approximately 250 school buses.  We are looking for sources that can offer an "off the self" commercial solution with installation capabilities. 

The system will be installed on buses manufactured/operated in Japan and Korea. The proposed system must work off of a 24 volt system.  Even though the interior of the buses have A/C and heating, the operation of the buses will be in extreme cold/hot humid climates.  The purpose is to increase safety/security and to deter inappropriate behavior occurring on and around school buses that transport elementary/middle/high school students in Okinawa, mainland Japan, and South Korea.  The system must not be intrusive or complicate to operate. Installation requirements should not be extensive.  The system must be able to record real time images and sound for an extensive amount time, auto-rewind, and continue to record without operator assistance.  As part of the system, DoDDS-Procurement is seeking a solution to easily transfer the data from the bus to a viewing device and then send short video/audio clips via e-mail to the appropriate authorities. 

Please submit your proposed products and service information to:larry_reed@pac.odedodea.edu.  Please place "Digital Camera" as subject line

STATEMENT OF WORK - Piece Part Provisioning and Obsolescence Support for the Dy4 DMV-179-2643 AN/AYK-14 (V) Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA)

1.0 INTRODUCTION

SCOPE

1.1 This contract provides for obsolescence management services and parts procurement needed to ensure our ability to manufacture and repair the DMV-179-2643 used as part of the EA6B Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) CP-2543 AN/AYK-14 (V).

BACKGROUND

1.2	The EA6B MIDS AN/AYK-14 (V) configuration includes a Dy4 Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) DMV-179-2643 processor.  Use of this COTS non-development item allowed the Navy to introduce this new processor technology to EA6B with lower non-recurring engineering cost.

1.3	Due to decreases in part demand, last time buy opportunities for some DMV-179-2643 piece-parts have been announced by part suppliers.  Included in the announcements are the PowerPC main processor chip and Level 2 cache memory parts.  Parts obsolescence, if not addressed, will prevent the manufacture of additional DMV-179-2643s.  The funding profile of the EA6B program dictates an acquisition approach where the DMV-179-2643 will be procured and fielded over a five-year time-span (i.e. through 2008).  Repairs to fielded DMV-179-2643s will be required through 2015.  

APPLICABILITY

1.4	This Statement of Work applies to the DMV-179-2643 processor card used as part of the AN/AYK-14 (V) EA6B MIDS system.

PURPOSE

1.5	The purpose of this task is to perform obsolescence management and related piece-part provisioning to ensure that no obsolete components issues arise which would preclude either Dy4’s ability to continue the manufacture of the DMV-179-2643 or Dy4’s ability to provide repair support.  Piece part provisioning for parts that become obsolete after the contract period for this contract will be funded under a follow-on contract.

2.0 REQUIREMENTS

2.1 The DMV-179-2643 shall have the following characteristics:

	a. 400 MHZ 7400 MPU, 2MB L2 Cache, 256MB SDRAM, 48MB Flash memory, 32 KB non-volatile SRAM, 10/100 Mbit Ethernet, two EIA-422/485 channels, native 179 pinout mode, V8.3.13 FFW or some backward compatible newer version of this firmware.  It shall include two DPMC-601-283 (dual) with two MIL-STD-1553 interfaces, 64K MiniACE installed in PMC site #2 (I/O comes out P2, rows A&C) and in PMC site #1, (I/O comes out P0, rows A,B,C,D&E).

2.2	The contractor shall establish a Longevity of Supply (LOS) management program for the Dy4 processor card described in paragraph 2.1 above.  The contractor shall provide parts provisioning and LOS support as defined by the requirements of this Statement of Work.

2.3	The contractor shall construct a manufacturing build package and/or changes to the technical data package to reflect the unique configuration of the product, including the customer specific variant in place of the standard Dy4 component number.

2.4	The contractor shall establish an AN/AYK-14 (V) government owned inventory to be separately held for AN/AYK-14 (V) specific Dy4 product.  The contractor shall maintain an inventory of parts allocated to the AN/AYK-14 (V) and provide quarterly as part of the Components Review Report Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001. Storage of components will be according to Dy4 standard storage practices.  The contractor shall store these parts in accordance with the “Deliveries or Performance” section of the contract.

2.5	For all buys of the DMV-179-2643 that include parts paid for under this contract, Dy4 shall get written permission via email from PMA-209 prior to making the sale.  As DMV-179-2643 cards are procured in the future from an authorized government agent, a credit shall be deducted from the purchase price equal to the price paid under this contract for government owned parts used in the manufacture of the DMV-179-2643.   

2.6	The contractor shall provide a complete Bill of Materials for the DMV-179-2643 to the Navy at the beginning and end of the contract period in accordance with CDRL A002.

2.7	On a quarterly basis the contractor shall undertake a complete Bill of Materials (BOM) review for all components of the DMV-179-2643.  The contractor shall examine every integrated circuit for continued availability and supportability.  Where any availability issues are identified, the contractor shall make recommendations to the government in accordance with CDRL A001 regarding sources for the components in the secondary markets or alternative components when available.

2.8	The contractor shall deliver a Components Review Report per CDRL A001 within 14 days after each quarterly BOM review.  This report shall include the following information at a minimum for all BOM components:

a.	Dy4 Component Number
b.	Dy4 quantity on hand
c.	For those items that no longer maintain Unrestricted Availability, estimated Dy4 quantity needed over and above quantity on hand to facilitate future build and repair.  Show both Contractor Furnished Material (CFM) and Government Furnished Material (GFM) inventory and Dy4’s unallocated inventory of like parts.”
d.	Manufacturer 
e.	Manufacturer Component Number
f.	Component Description
g.	Availability Status – Unrestricted Availability, Available Until, Last Time Buy, or Obsolete
h.	If deemed obsolete, recommended Dy4 course of action (either component lifetime buy or replacement with equivalent or “better than” component)
i.	If equivalent or “better than” part recommended, planned validation/verification effort to be performed
j.	A list of BOM changes as a result of LOS activity for the previous quarter. 
k.	A list of current AN/AYK-14 (V) government owned parts stock on hand including part number and quantity.
l.	A list of all design changes made to the DMV-179-2643 for the previous quarter, including a description of the change, reason for change, and validation/verification effort performed to verify no impact to form, fit or function.
m.	If applicable, the piece part price and total quantity and total price for proposed lifetime buy.
n.	A summary of all purchases by authorized government agents that occurred during the review period.  This summary would include at a minimum, a list of government owned parts used and the credit given to the authorized purchasing agent for their use.

2.9	Within 14 days after receipt of all component discontinuation notices, the contractor shall submit to the Navy an Obsolete Component Action Request (CDRL A003).  This request shall at a minimum contain the same information identified above for the Components Review Report, but as related only to the part being discontinued.  

2.10	 For items deemed obsolete by the contractor, the Navy will provide concurrence, or recommend changes to the course of action recommended by the contractor within 14 days of receipt of the quarterly Components Review Report or the Obsolete Component Action Request.  If the Navy concurs with the contractor’s recommendation to procure obsolete parts, this shall be done via a bi-lateral contract modification in accordance with clause 5252.217-9500 Ordering – Provisioned Items (Fixed Price) (NOV 1999) (NAVAIR) of this contract.  The contractor shall place the newly procured parts under configuration control and inventory control along with all other DMV-179-2643 parts held in storage and allocated to the AN/AYK-14 (V) program.

<DESC>Fulfillment House for NPS Fundamentals Training Program=20 Scope of Work Statement Program Description "National Park Service Fundamentals" is a five-part course of study that en= compasses a broad understanding of the mission and goals of the National Pa= rk Service.  Vendor is required to manage the assembly, storage and distrib= ution of training materials related to this training program (hereafter "Fu= ndamentals").  The primary need is the assembly, storage, and distribution = of approximately 2000 notebooks during Federal fiscal year FY2004 (October = 1, 2003 - September 30, 2004).  =20 The NPS Training Manager for Universal Competencies provides program oversi= ght and is the vendor's principal contact, but may appoint a designee.  The=  Training Manager is duty-stationed at the Albright Training Center, Grand = Canyon, Arizona. =20 Vendor should note that Fundamentals is a new, evolving program.  The follo= wing description is as accurate a view of the current workings of the progr= am as possible, but circumstances may require reasonable accommodation of e= merging program needs.  An example of an accommodation is handling fluctuat= ions in the numbers of mailings to individual employees, either fewer or gr= eater than the numbers provided below, which are based on averages.=20 Materials Two notebooks are used in the program, one for Fundamentals I-II, and one f= or Fundamentals III-V.  The notebooks, ideally, are shipped directly to emp= loyees at any or all of the approximately 400 National Park Service units a= nd offices in the United States.  Occasionally, a shipment of notebooks for=  a group of approximately 30 employees must be shipped as a whole to a spec= ific training location. =20 Materials currently used in the Fundamentals training program consist of in= dividual items that the vendor must assemble into sets as follows: =20 Item #1=20 =09NPS Fundamentals I-II binder (12" x 11 =BE" x 3 =BD") =09Cardboard Fundamentals shipping carton (13 1/8" x 12 1/8" x 3 =BE") =09Tabs for Fundamentals I (9 tabs total, hole-punched, to be put on the bi= nder posts) =098 =BD" x 11" plastic CD-Rom sleeve, hole-punched, to be put on the binde= r posts =09CD-Rom to be inserted into the sleeve (above) =09LMS Learner's Desk Aid (11" x 17" single fold, pre-folded), to be laid o= n top of the tabs =09Letter from the Chief of Training (single 8 =BD" x 11" sheet), to be lai= d behind the Learner's Desk Aid on                 top of the tabs Item #2 =0924 tabs for Fundamentals II (approximately 5/16" thick) =09Fundamentals II binder contents  (currently 220 pages, approximately =BE= " thick) Item #3 =09NPS Fundamentals III-V binder (12" x 11 =BE" x 3 =BD") =09Cardboard Fundamentals shipping carton (13 1/8" x 12 1/8" x 3 =BE") =09Tabs for Fundamentals III (9 tabs hole-punched, to be put on the binder = posts) =09Tabs for Fundamentals IV (9 tabs, hole-punched, to be put on the binder = posts)  [approximate thickness                 of Fundamentals III & IV tab= s together is 5/16" per package] Item #4 =0924 tabs for Fundamentals V (approximately 5/16" thick) =09Fundamentals V binder contents  (currently 114 pages, approximately 3/8"=  thick) Tasks The following services are required:=20 1)=09Transfer (removal from the current warehouse and receipt into vendor's=  warehouse) of existing materials from current fulfillment house.
