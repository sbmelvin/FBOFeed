<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS Code is  with a size standard of $6.0 M. The Department of Health and Human Services seeks to acquire ?2009 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Formation and Design? services utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.500, 12.603, and 12.602. The overarching objective of the 2009 NBCUS is to produce reliable and accurate estimates of national and regional collections, utilization, and safety of all blood products?red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, plasma based pharmaceutical products, and platelets along with tissue and stem cell products from peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow origins.  Such estimates require that the data being reported by the NBCUS institutions be weighted.  Weighting inflates sample totals and adjusts for over- and under-representation of relevant institution characteristics in the sample compared with the population of all institutions.   New to the most recent 2007 NBCUS was the desire to specifically identify and collect baseline data to support efforts towards a real-time bio-vigilance safety monitoring system.  The 2009 NBCUS will further this groundwork with significant stakeholder involvement in the design and pre-analytical phase of the survey.  This contract will provide HHS with all of the required work involved with preparing the survey instrument, including facility (participant) identification, stakeholder conferences, analytical weighting, and survey design. The specific key objectives are: a) Identify, solicit, convene, and foster relevant stakeholder participation in the identification and approval of survey data elements; b) Design and produce appropriate paper-based compartmentalized survey instrument ; and c) Identify appropriate participant facilities and select sample with appropriate weighting algorithms. See the attached solicitation document RFP 07T027002 accompanying this synopsis for further details regarding the requirement and instructions to Offerors. In accordance with RFP section L.2.1., All questions must be submitted in writing via email to Jonathan Hamlet at jonathan.hamlet@psc.gov by 12:00 PM EASTERN TIME Wednesday, August, 1, 2007. In accordance with RFP section L.2.2. all proposals must be submitted via electronic copy and hard copy to the addresses and locations cited in the section by 4:00 PM EASTERN TIME, Monday, August 13, 2007.

The equipment listed in this procurement have been identified as key components of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integrationn, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment in this procurement as a key component of the Department's infrastructure. The equipment is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State's enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equpment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualificatioins are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requiremtns as a key compontent of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>99--Utility of Nonradar Training in the En Route Environment Market Survey
<SOLNBR>5871
<RESPDATE>082407
<ARCHDATE>09232007
<CONTACT>AnneMarie Ternay, (609) 485-6990
<DESC>This market survey advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.1. The FAA invests a significant amount of resources in training its workforce.  To make a good investment, the agency maintains training objectives that are specific, measurable and task relevant.  One environment that developmental air traffic control specialists (ATCS) are trained to perform in, nonradar, has become an unlikely part of their future job.  For this reason, its relevance has become questioned.  Eliminating nonradar training might save FAA resources or allow them to be allocated to other types of training.  However, there is anecdotal evidence from the FAA Academy that developmentals who perform poorly on nonradar training also perform poorly in radar associate (RA) training.  There is also anecdotal evidence from the field that developmentals not receiving nonradar training, or only a portion of the training, performed poorly during radar training.  These observations suggest that nonradar training may make unique contributions to achieving relevant training objectives.   Nonradar training is provided as a part of the Initial En Route Training course.  During the course, the FAA provides job-related knowledge and skill oriented training to developmental ATCS. The course consists of four blocks of training: academics, nonradar academics/lab, radar academics/medium fidelity lab, and RA lab.  The objective of the training is to enable the developmental to progress into field-delivered stages of air traffic control training.  Over one-third of the time spent in the course, 18 of 53 days, is devoted to the nonradar academics/lab block.  During this block, developmentals receive training on separation, coordination, control judgment, methods and procedures, and communication skills in a nonradar environment.   The FAA is seeking to learn of industry capabilities that will deliver conclusive scientific evidence about the utility of nonradar training so that the agency can make the best investment decisions.  The agency expects to require the contractor to deliver several pieces of information as part of the evaluation.  First, the contractor will identify what radar training needs nonradar training may meet or enhance.  Second, the contractor will identify the elements of nonradar training that meet the needs or enhance training effectiveness.  Finally, the contractor will compare the training effectiveness of the current nonradar training to a system without this type of training, and to a viable, efficient and effective alternative.         Interested vendors are requested to submit the following information. .	Demonstrated application of knowledge of learning and training methodology to the evaluation of training programs and to instructional systems development (ISD).  Training evaluation experience should be emphasized with indication of the following:  .	Assessing knowledge, measuring behavior/skill, and assessing job performance .	Identifying and addressing evaluation design issues .	Knowledge of training evaluation alternatives .	Evaluation at multiple levels, from training effectiveness to job performance .	Experience with the operational Air Traffic Technical Training system    .	Proposed approach to the nonradar training evaluation .	Estimated duration of the project .	Comments on requirements All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. Responses may be submitted by email to earl.stein@faa.gov.  If sent electronically, it is preferred that the response be sent as an attachment to the email message in Microsoft Word, PDF or similar format, on company letterhead and print to no more than 10 pages, on 8  x11 paper size and using 12 point font.   Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  One, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  Information obtained will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a nonradar training evaluation. Interested parties should reply via email, by close of business August 24, 2007, to earl.stein@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Air Force intends to negotiate with the Properties at Wright Field, LLC, on a sole source basis for the privatization of an additional 102 units of military family housing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will be partially funded with appropriated funds and tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members? monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.  Estimated Transaction Closing: 20 September 2007.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with the Properties at Wright Field, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 1,536 residential units at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. NO DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be 25 July 2007.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely available from only one source, because only the current privatization developer is able to satisfy the agency?s needs. An attempt to compete this requirement would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition, and unacceptable schedule delays in eliminating substandard housing.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer, must be able to demonstrate in writing, by 8 August 2007, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack of priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information received. A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be available from the Project Manager on or about 25 July 2007.    It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described real estate transaction contact with the incumbent developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any submissions is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

<DESC>Task Order Against National BLM IDIQ Contract for the Estes Valley 2 Fuels Reduction Project.  The Estes Valley 2 Fuel Reduction Project includes 905 acres of the total treatment area.  Treatment objectives for all treatment units in the project area are:  to reduce the risk of crown fire near Estes Park and surrounding communities; to reduce the fuel loading; to reduce ladder fuels; and to improve the long term health and vigor of these forests. The intent of this prescription is to accomplish these objectives by use of uneven-aged management treatments to establish open, irregularly-stocked, multi-aged stands which can be maintained through time by periodic prescribed burning and possibly harvests.  To accomplish this, removals will be concentrated in smaller diameter classes, but a few small trees will be left to eventually grow into larger diameter classes.  This under thinning will:  1) Reduce the threat of crown fire by removing small diameter live ladder fuels; 2) Reduce overall stocking levels to improve the health and vigor of the stands; and 3) Alter the existing species composition by reducing the number of lodge pole pine and Douglas fir and leaving greater numbers of ponderosa pine and aspen.  In general, this prescription will focus on removal of trees in the smaller diameter classes but trees of larger diameter may be cut for purposes stated below.  Rights to salvage material will not be provided to the Contractor in the Estes Valley 2 Fuels Reduction Project.  This solicitation will only be made available (for free download) through FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov.      This project is set aside for contractors with current BLM IDIQ contracts.

The contract period of performance will be from 15 August 2007 to 14 August 2008, with two one-year option periods. The purpose of the contract will be to increase exposure of Tribal Governments to drought preparedness planning methodologies with the goal of increasing their ability to plan for, cope with, and recover from the recurring episodes of drought and its impacts on tribal lands. The objectives of this project will be to: 1) Prepare a drought planning framework or set of guidelines for Tribal Governments to follow and adopt to their specific needs given current and future resource constraints and land/water conditions. This framework will incorporate examples and lessons learned from existing tribal drought plans and through discussions with tribal representatives and relevant stakeholders who have been involved in drought planning activities, and 2) organize and conduct drought planning workshops at key locations in drought prone regions to demonstrate, and receive feedback on, the application of the drought planning framework to specific local conditions. These workshops will be conducted in locations such as Albuquerque, New Mexico; Salt Lake City, Utah; Las Vegas, Nevada; Rapid City, South Dakota; and Sacramento, California. There will also be follow-up workshops and training exercises. Part of this action is needed due to the National Drought Policy Commissions review of tribal drought planning efforts which was conducted thought outreach efforts to tribes.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Basic Ordering Agreements for Tissue Allografts
<SOLNBR>FA7000-07-R-0058
<RESPDATE>080207
<ARCHDATE>08172007
<CONTACT>Donna Kichton, Contract Specialist, Phone 719-333-4143, Fax 719-333-9103, Email donna.kichton@usafa.af.mil - Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer, Phone 719 333-3961, Fax 719-333-9103, Email leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil
<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, is interested in establishing a maximum of four Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA?s) to provide allografts.  The period of performance for the BOA will be five years from the date of issue.  The BOA must provide for the following requirements: locate and provide allografts to include the following types: freeze-dried, fresh frozen, osteochondral, irradiated, non-irradiated, volume & length and width human tissue grafts using pertinent information such as the size & dimensions of the necessary graft, the age of the donor and requisite date of receipt to conduct a search of nationally accredited tissue banks to find the desired allograft; and provide a representative on an as-needed basis to provide on-site assistance to surgeons in determining the appropriate allograft to use.  Occasionally there may be a need for tissue for emergency procedures that must be provided on a short notice basis.  BOA contractors must be able to front the cost of the allografts, as payment by the Government will be made directly to the contractor on a reimbursement basis.  Payment cannot be made to a third party (i.e. tissue bank providing the graft). 

We are seeking a maximum of four qualified companies with which to establish the BOA.  Receiving a BOA will be based upon the company?s ability to meet the criteria identified above.  If four or less qualified companies indicate an interest in a BOA, the government may reserve the right to award a BOA to all four companies.  In the event we receive more than four responses, the Government may request and evaluate past performance references.  The government reserves the right to award up to four BOA?s to the companies with the highest past performance rating.  Should an evaluation of past performance result in more than four companies remaining equally eligible, award of BOAs shall be made by drawing of lots limited to those equally-eligible companies using procedures found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 14.408-6.  

Once BOAs are established, each individual requirement for an allograft will be competed amongst the BOA contractors and an order issued to the contractor offering the lowest price on that particular order.  Each order will be competed in the same manner.  There is no guarantee that a contractor will receive any orders against their BOA.  

 Companies interested in receiving a BOA must provide evidence of their qualifications for meeting the requirements as specified above.  In addition, any companies located outside of the Colorado Springs/Denver area must also address how you will meet the requirement to provide a representative to assist the surgeons, including providing a representative on a short notice basis for emergency surgeries.  Written responses will not be returned. If your firm is capable and qualified to provide the services, respond in writing to the point of contact indicated within this announcement no later than 2 August 2007. All interested business concerns shall indicate their interest in a potential BOA by providing the company name, mailing address, telephone number, cage code, DUNS number and electronic mail address to the point of contact. Interested business concerns shall also submit appropriate written information and/or data supporting their capability to perform the required services. For the purpose of a potential BOA, the North American Industrial Classification Code is 621991 and the applicable size standard is $9.0M. Orders written against a BOA are anticipated to be firm-fixed price.   The primary contact point is Donna Kichton, 719 333-4143.  E-mail responses to donna.kichton@usafa.af.mil .

<DESC>Production and Delivery of a Portable Waveguide Immunoassay System & Development of Assays for the Portable Waveguide Immunoassay System

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)  intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to the Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation/Georgia Tech for the Production and Delivery of a Portable Waveguide Immunoassay System & Development of Assays for the Portable Waveguide Immunoassay System.  A prior CFSAN extramural cooperative research grant (#FD-U-002492-01) was awarded to the University of Georgia to develop a waveguide immunoassay for the pathogen Yersinia Pestis.  The initial work by the University of Georgia /Georgia Tech consortium has shown that a waveguide sensor can serve as the basis for detection of bacteria in food matrices.  CFSAN and the FDA have an increasing need for access to technologies that can rapidly assess the presence of bacteria and toxins in foods.  The waveguide system developed by the Georgia consortium should be further considered by CFSAN in its overall program to develop multiplexed sensor systems for selective detection of bacteria and toxins in foods.  At present, no commercial entity can offer an optical sensor with multi-analyte capabilities that has been demonstrated to selectively detect bacteria in food matrices.  Therefore, CFSAN must continue to work with the University of Georgia/Georgia Technical Research Institute consortium to research the capabilities of this sensor system.  The objective of the contract is to have a waveguide immunoassay system constructed, to deliver the system to CFSAN with software, hardware and reagents necessary to conduct the validation of its proper function at CFSAN with Salmonella enterica spp, to develop a selective assay for Salmonella with antibodies chosen in consultation with CFSAN,  to develop surface chemistries and methodologies necessary for the adaptation of the assay to additional bacterial targets, viruses, protein toxins and seafood toxins, and to perform validation studies to demonstrate the robustness of these applications.  The contractor will be required to 1) produce a portable waveguide immunoassay system that  will consist of hardware and software necessary to evaluate the detection and quantification of bacteria in food matrices;  2) provide user training upon system delivery so that Government personnel can reproduce the delivery performance test with Salmonella enterica spp; 3) develop a surface chemistry and an assay for the selective detection of a strain of Salmonella enterica spp in test portions which may also contain up to four microorganisms, such as E.coli, L. monocytogenes, C. jejuni, Campylobacter or other food borne pathogens;  4) develop a number of surface and surface chemistry techniques to expand the capabilities for selective multi-analyte detection in foods.    The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation as the only source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  Sources interested in this requirement must provide a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 54710.  Responses must be in writing and must be received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposed of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Eagle Eye, 10560 Main Street, PH-18
Fairfax, VA 22030-7182 to acquire web-site software and license, technical support, documentation of Configuration Management, technical advice and analyzed data sets of the Federal acquisition and grants funding activities, for the period of FY2000 through FY2007 and updates in FY2008 including the web display software to allow searching and filtering on many data fields which establishes the existing relationships between organizations receiving Federal financial assistance (referred to as FFATA Data), to allow free public, easily accessible searching and filtering on many data fields similar to the www.fedspending.org web site, as it currently exists.  The launch of the Government Web site for search of contracts and grants is scheduled for August 2007.

The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) of 2006 directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to lead the development of a single searchable website, accessible by the public free of charge including, for each Federal award, the following information:
?	the name of the entity receiving the award; 
?	the amount of the award; 
?	information on the award including transaction type, funding
agency, etc; 
?	the primary location of the performance, including the city, state, congressional district, and country;
?	the location of the entity receiving the award; and
?	a unique identifier of the entity receiving the award. 

Once acquired, the improved Federal acquisition and grants data sets, along with the search and display software, will assist the Government in meeting the initial requirements of the FFATA.  The public will be able to enter queries against the FFATA data, handle subsequent database processing, to include database access; query; processing; and data aggregation, and support presentation of the search results in an intuitive, user friendly fashion.  The requirement is for an already developed website with improved data sets of Federal acquisitions and grants activities similar to www.fedspending.org web site in order to meet the key milestones within the time frame required. 
Eagle Eye is the only known source with the ability to provide software with analyzed pre-populated Federal acquisition and grants agency data with existing documentation, for FY?s 2000-2006 and available FY 2007 data ? due within three (3) days after award and with technical support to the government to install and configure the initial version of the web site software to become operational within three (3) weeks after award of the contract.  The final FY2007and FY2008 updates will follow.  While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes, interested parties may submit information that shall be considered by GSA.  Inquiries may be directed to Kisha Emmanuel, Contracting Officer, via e-mail to kisha.emmanuel@gsa.gov.

The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, and Parametric Cost estimate (PCE) documents and utilizing Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) SGML/SPECINTACT and SUCCESS program in tropical environment similar to Hawaii and Guam; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members proposed for preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, and Parametric Cost estimate (PCE) documents and utilizing Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) SGML/SPECINTACT and SUCCESS program in tropical environment similar to Hawaii and Guam; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 07 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB and .13% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (July 2006) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2006).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.  The submittal/delivery address is Commander, Code NAVFAC PAC ACQ11 (A-E Solicitation No. N62742-07-R-0024), Attn:  Mailroom (MS2), NAVFAC PACIFIC, 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860-3134.  This address is for all deliveries, including U.S. Mail, courier service and/or personal delivery services; no other address is acceptable.  The delivery address is inside a military installation, therefore, strict securities measures are in force; anticipate delays.  Interested firms must allow sufficient time for receipt of submission.  Consultants to the prime A-E firm are required to submit only Part II of the SF 330.  This solicitation requires all interested firms to have an email address.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an aircraft deice and anti-ice unit according to the following specifications: Specifications for Aircraft De-Ice/Anti-Ice Unit Unit will have 2 separate operating systems to prevent cross contamination of fluids. Anti-Ice System-Storage (stainless steel) tanks, 500 gallon capacity.  Appropriate pump/engine combination capable of dispensing Type IV Anti-Ice fluids. Dispensing guns located on lift basket and at ground level for easy access for fluid and unit servicing.  De-Ice System- Storage (stainless steel) tanks, 100 gallon capacity and have a thermostatically controlled immersion heater.  Appropriate pump/engine combination capable of dispensing Type I De-Ice fluids.  Dispensing guns located on lift basket and at ground level for easy access for fluid and unit servicing. Hi-lift- Telescoping platform/basket hydraulic/electric up to 30 to 40, controls at work platform and ground control panel. A 300 lb. basket capacity with safety harness attachment provisions.	Appropriate work lighting mounted to work basket. Power System-Unit must be self-sustaining, hydraulic operation of lift assembly may piggy-back either one of the systems.  Provided system integrating is maintained.  A cabinet mounted control panel to monitor systems installed on unit. Cart/Trailer-Pintle hook style tow bar actuated parking brake and cabinet (Steel) enclosing systems. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Premier Engineering and Manufacturing, Inc.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	 The deice/anti-ice unit is the only unit suited for operation at NASA Glenn Research Center.  Premier Engineering & Manufacturing, Inc. is the manufacturer and sole distributor. This unit has the unique ability to be built with both Type I Deice Fluid which has to be heated in order for it to perform correctly.  In addition, it will have the ability to dispense Type IV AntiIce Fluid (non-heated) from the same unit without cross contamination.  Which would require NASA Glenn to purchase two separate units to complete the tasks of one Model HC29050 Hot Shot Aircraft Deicer. This unit will enable the NASA Glenn Aircraft Operations Office to perform winter operations safely and in accordance With NASA, FAA and EPA procedures, guidelines, and regulations. Therefore it would be the best interest of the government to purchase this unit from Premier Engineering and Manufacturing, Inc.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 noon local time on July 30, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Modular Mini-Workstation Tool Stowage Caddy (MMWS TSC)repair and sustaining engineering support. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the service from Swales Aerospace.  During the initial certification of the MMWS TSC, a failure mode was identified which could render the TSC non-functional.  This failure mode must be eliminated to maximize the ability of a Space Shuttle crew to successfully complete an EVA TPS repair should such an emergency arise.  Swales personnel available for this task have extensive experience with the MMWS TSC, having developed and certified both this specific EVA tool, as well as heritage hardware used in servicing the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which shares common components and subassemblies with the MMWS TSC.  Transferring this qualitative experience to other similarly qualified designers and technicians is cost prohibitive. Furthermore, the MMWS TSC shares a common failure mode with its heritage HST tool.  Swales has since implemented a design change on the HST tool eliminating this failure mode.  This design solution is directly applicable to the MMWS TSC because they share common components.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on August 9, 2007.

<DESC>This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Integration Backbone (DIB) Management Office (DMO). The requirement is for a study to be conducted to extend the DIB support to the complete DCGS Enterprise community. The study will identify what is needed to design, build, validate, deploy, govern, monitor, maintain and evolve a DCGS enterprise in terms of defining a framework that describes the policies, standards, guidelines, metrics, processes, roles, and responsibilities that are needed to ensure enterprise interoperability within a federated Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  This effort requires additional capabilities that are not currently well understood by the DoD environment. The study will be conducted to identify scope and articulate the technology requirement and cost estimates in order to procure funding in the FY2010 POM for extension of the DIB program to support DCGS Enterprise requirements.  Please see attachment for further information.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Synopsys, Inc. 700 E Middlefield Rd., Mountain View, CA  940434024.  under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), soliciting from a single source to purchase Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) device simulation software.  TCAD simulators are primarily designed for simulation of low voltage micro-electronic devices made using the silicon material.  The capabilities of different TCAD simulators vary widely for high voltage semiconductors devices.  The nature of the NIST work involves simulation of future deices and materials that have not yet been considered by commercial TCAD vendors.  It is widely acknowledged within the field that it has not been possible to achieve convergence of SiC bipolar power device simulations without artificially increasing the equilibrium concentration of free carrier.  However, it has been recently demonstrated (Hillkirk et. al, SISPAD 2007) that by using specific numerical features of Taurus-Medici it is possible to achieve convergence of electro-thermal, transient, mixed-mode simulations of complex SiC bipolar power devices without artificially increasing the initial equilibrium carrier concentration by either optical nor thermal means. To NIST?s knowledge only Synopsys Inc. has demonstrated, in a publication, convergence of SiC bipolar power device transient simulations without artificially increasing the initial equilibrium free carrier concentration by thermal or optical carrier generation.  Synopsys Inc. offers two TCAD device simulation products for wide-bandgap bipolar device simulation, Taurus-Medici and Sentaurus Device. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement, in writing, no later than the response date.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Building Environment Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with NOVA Analytical Systems, Inc., for the purchase of Nova Models 7464SPK & 7461LPK Portable Engine Exhaust Analyzer.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST requires Nova Models 7464SPK & 7461LPK Portable Engine Exhaust Analyzer as part of a project to study carbon monoxide production from gas-powered emergency generators.  In order to support the experimental work, portable equipment is needed that can continuously monitor carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen and hydrocarbon gases over a large range of concentrations during tests to research the production of these gases while operating gas-powered emergency generators.  In addition, NIST has designed a National Instruments data acquisition system along with software developed at NIST to link the NOVA with the National Instruments system.  Changing to another device would result in the need for reworking the data acquisition system.  Therefore, the Nova analyzers must be 100 percent compatible with the existing data acquisition equipment.  Nova Analytical Systems, Inc, is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the analyzers that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 8, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc, of Nashua, New Hampshire, for the purchase of Turbomolecular Pumps and Pressure Measurement Systems.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST requires the new Turbomolecular Pumps and Pressure Measurement Systems for the new low temperature AFM project.  This system must be identical with NIST?s existing stock of vacuum pumps, so that the pumps, controllers, and spart parts can be interchanged if a pump or controller fails in order to keep vacuum integrity in critical experiments.  In addition, the pressure-measurement items must be compatible with the existing stock so that gauges and controllers can be interchanged in case of failure, and also make use of the same stock of spare parts.  The turbo pumps are required to have compression ratios for N2 greater than 1E10 and for H2 greater than 5E5; and N2 greater than 1E11 and for H2 greater than 1E5.  Therefore, sole source determination is based on the need to maintain 100 percent compatibility with existing equipment at NIST.  Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 8, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for a Thousands Blocks Pooling Administration requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.   The Governments requirement is to contract with a vendor that will serve as an independent designated entity responsible for administering Thousands-Block number pools by assigning, managing, forecasting, reporting and processing data that will allow service providers in rate areas designated for Thousands-Block number pooling to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000.  Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources.  Since its implementation, Thousands-Block number pooling has substantially helped conserve NANP resources, and extended the projected exhaust of the NANP until approximately 2036.  In 2005 alone, the Pooling Administrator processed over 100,000 applications for 1,000 number blocks and assigned close to 56,000 blocks.  Pooling of telephone numbers has saved 25,557 central office codes (exchange numbers) from exhaustion. This requirement is for a follow-on contract of an existing contract which was awarded on 2001 to with NeuStar, Inc. and expires in June 2006.  Services are to cover a one year base period and  four one-year option periods.  The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL06000004 within 2  4 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis.   Anticipated award date is September 2006.  The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 30 days after release of the solicitation.  Although it is the Governments intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0932 or via email @ anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) The PEO EIS, Chief, Technology Office, (PEO EIS CTO) Fort Belvoir, VA is seeking information from industry to identify possible locations for the U.S. Armys next Continental United States (CONUS) Area Processing Center(s) (APC). The Army is in the process of consolidating external network interface points, enterprise applications and servers into Army Area Processing Centers (APC) with the objective of improving network security management and obtaining operational efficiencies Se rvice wide.  The first two APCs are being built at Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs) and will begin operation in the later half of CY07.  The APC capabilities include an improved Army network security pe rimeter, server and application hosting, electronic mail, storage management, and Network Operations (NETOPS).  The Army anticipates the need to build additional APCs and intends to revisit its site selection process, revalidate and perhaps broaden the list of future APC locations.   Therefore, the Army is seeking information from industry and other Government organ izations on existing and available data centers that could serve as future APC(s).  The Army desires information on the capabilities and services (especially application migration support, email, data storage, and application hosting) that commercial indus try or other Government agencies provide as part of their portfolio of service offerings.  The Army is also interested in exploring the types, parameters, and costs models (including service guarantees) of service level agreements offered by the provider. The Army will use this information to assess the capabilities and economic feasibility of potential future APC sites.  Some (but not all) of the salient characteristics that will be considered in the analysis are: available bandwidth into facility; dual-ho med connectivity with path diversity of the network connection; 40 ft x 40 ft of available raised floor space; hot cutover or service-level-agreement (SLA) based power and cooling capability; location outside of natural disaster prone areas; ability to mee t DOD force and facility protection condition requirements.  The Army urges responders to provide additional discriminators that it should consider.    APC constraints are: Continental United States (CONUS) only; Unclassified processing (NIPRNET) is primary focus; Classified processing (SIPRNET) expandability may be included as a secondary assessment parameter; Ability to host applications for both Army h ome based and deployed forces.  This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  The Army will properly handle all information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary.  The Army will not return responses to the RFI.  Re sponses to this notice are not offers and the Government will not accept them to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.   Parties interested in responding to this RFI should provide all pertinent information to include name, email, phone number, Company name, etc. via e-mail in Microsoft Office format no later than 27 August 2007.  Submit all information and any questions to APC_RFI@eis.army.mil.  Should you have any difficulties with the email address, please contact Demetrius L. Davis at dldavis@mitre.org or (703)983-2093.  ***VERY IMPORTANT: SUBMIT ALL INFORMATION AND ANY QUESTIONS TO APC_RFI@EIS.ARMY.MIL***

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the University of California, Santa Barbara for the design and implementation guidance for a programmatic approach to intensively monitored watersheds and similar large-scale management action experiments.

Background and Objectives		The Northwest FisheriesScience Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region?s marine and anadromous resources.  To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress.  One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring project to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins.  The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule-set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin.  The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches.  The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses the development of design and implementation guidance for a programmatic approach to population-scale management action experiments, often referred to as Intensively Monitored Watersheds (IMW).
Specifically this project seeks to develop the following two products:

1.2.1  Experimental design guidelines for large-scale (e.g., watersheds) ecological experiments to demonstrate the effect of management actions such as aquatic habitat restoration on population processes of species of interest.

1.2.2  Implementation guidelines for the development of a program of large-scale management action experiments that balances replication, spatial representativeness and cost-effectiveness

 . The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2009. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. 

This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the University of California without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7166 attention to Melvin Fondue.

NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.<BR><BR>CA/CST has identified the HP DC7700 SFF Workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The HP DC7700 SFF Workstation is a small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation features the Intel Core 2 Duo dual-core processor. Dual core processors can deliver a substantial performance increase over single-core processors for multi-threaded applications, multi-tasking environments, or demanding single-threaded applications, allowing the user to work with noticeably quicker results. The tool-less access chassis design of the workstation is efficient, open, quiet, and easy to maintain, service, and upgrade. The dc7700 SFF workstation can be customized to fit CST requirements. 2)	The HP dc7700 SFF workstation complies with CAs baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality:  Hardware: 	Fujitsu fi-4220C document scanner (USB) 	Gryphon D220 barcode scanner (USB) 	Hewlett-Packard Business Inkjet 1100d printer (USB) 	NEC Multisync LCD (liquid crystal display) 1760V monitor 	PKI (public key infrastructure) (USB) 	Smiths Heimann Biometrics ACCO 1394 single fingerprint scanner (FireWire) 	Cross Match L SCAN Guardian fingerprint scanner 	Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner 	Dell UltraSharp 1905FP (flat panel) monitor Software: 	ACRS (Automated Cash Register System), version 07.00.02 	ACS (American Citizen Services) Plus, version 1.02.01 	CST (Consular Shared Tables), version 04.01.00 	CST_PWD (Consular Shared Tables  Password) version 01.02.00 	INK (Independent Name Check), version 01.02.02 	IV (Immigrant Visa), version 04.03.00 	NIV (Nonimmigrant Visa System), version 04.04.00 COTS Software: 	Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.0 	Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, Service Pack 2 (SP2) 	Microsoft Office 2003 Professional, Service Release 2 (SR2) 	Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition, version 10.0.2.2021 	Oracle Client 9i 	WinZip 9.0 In summation, CA/CST believes that the Departments best interests will be served if the HP dc7700 SFF workstation is procured at this time.

<DESC>This notice is to update the status of the CFT source selection.  The package has been delayed yet again due to required revisions to some of our internal documentation.  The core of the strategy is largely unchanged.  We cannot offer any kind of prediction as to when the RFP will be released.  We are told once all the of final changes are made, it will take approximately 2 weeks to obtain final approval signature and be able to release the RFP.  At this point, we still have not gotten the documents into the approval process, so it seems unlikely anything will happen before 6 Aug 2007.  Due to the incredibly compressed timelines at this point, it is not likely we will be able to give ANY advance notice prior to RFP release.  All interested parties are encouraged to watch WWW.FBO.GOV daily for the RFP release from this point forward.  Mostly likely the formal RFP will be released sometime in Aug 2007, but this is not a promise.

Thank you for your continued interest.

HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1. The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available  on the World Wide Web on or about 22 June 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. 2.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Global Positioning System (GPS) Block III RFP Release
<SOLNBR>FA880706R0001
<RESPDATE>072507
<CONTACT>Alan Mak, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 363-1741, Fax null, Email alan.mak@losangeles.af.mil - Felicia Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (310) 653-3756, Fax null, Email Felicia.Brown@LosAngeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing has POSTED the first Amendment to the Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library on 25 July 2007.  

The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsmans role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror?s concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, and he can be reached at James.Gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

PROJECT  TITLE:	JEAN LAFITTE -  JELA100183 Replace Barataria Telephone Equipment 	PROJECT NUMBER:	JELA -  7530-07-0013 LOCATION :	Barataria Preserve, Marrero LA RFQ Number	7530-07-0013		7/19/2007 Question and Response to Contractor  The following notations which clarify and/or alter the project requirements have been determined to be new requirements or clarification of specification as a result of the "Pre-Proposal meeting held on this date. Specification of Requirements - The specification calls for a MICS equipment type, though review of the overall project requirement indicates that a CICS 8 x 24 equipment type will meet and provide suitable future system growth for this site. Therefore, a CICS equipment type is acceptable alternative to the specification. Specification of Requirements New Cabling termination points.  1.	Terminate new cabling at Visitor Center offices and Admin (LE) offices using 'patch panels'. 2.	Terminate new cabling at Maintenance Bld. Using 110 block. Specification of Requirements - Equipment Schedule - Telephone desk sets - "	The park wants all desk units to be model 7316.   "	A 'reception' module is not required. Specification of Requirements - Equipment Schedule - new items and programming "	Provide one (1) additional anolog extension module to CICS equipment in addition to the one which  comes with the equipment. "	Provide in building cable/s to be installed, jack locations as directed, for two (2) additional fax machines to be programmed through the Nortel system.  One to be located in Visitor Center. One to be located in the Maintenance building. Allow 100 ft additional jack wiring for maintenance fax location.  NOTE: the currently direct wired fax machine (wired on specific trunk line) at Admin (LE) will remain direct wired outside of the Nortel equipment. The following questions were received on 7-23-07 from a vendor reviewing the project requirements, which he felt required clarification. Questions and Answers - The telephone equipment schedule does not call for  'Caller ID trunk packs' . Is this a desired feature of the phone system. Answer is no. Caller ID is not required. LSDS trunk cards will function  without caller ID. The telephone back up battery supply is specified to provide 1 hour of back up coverage, is this what you want, this is a very large unit.   Clarification - due to wattage of system requirements, an APC 1500-1600 volt amp power supply and surge  protection will be sufficient in lieu of the 1 hour specification requirement. Does this telephone equipment require a voice mail module? Yes, the system should be equipped with voice mail system capable of capacity for the total number of telephone extensions in the system, including a 'general message' mailbox and system messaging to incoming callers, such as for site information, employee directory etc.  For example, Call Pilot 100 should meet system requirements.  Programming and set up of the voice mail system is also inclusive of the work requirements. End of Questions. Brian Strack

<DESC>The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) began a project in 2005 to convert its network database management system (IDMS) to a modern relational management system (DB2).  This project is expected to be completed by September 2007.  The RRB?s body of data was redefined to fit the new DB2 management system.  This resulted in the development of data tables containing data that used to be stored independently in each application.  Some data, particularly identifying information, existed in each separate database, having separate sources and uses.   The new environment houses all the data in tables that co-exist in the same environment, making comparisons easy and apparent redundancy noticeable.  While the conversion itself is expeditious, it does not address the duplicate data which will become very apparent and will counteract the efficiency of the new relational database management system.  The RRB is seeking sources to provide data optimization services which will include, but not be limited to, eliminating multiple representations of the same data, redefining data that is apparently the same but has subtle differences, and documenting the data.  Potential offers should send an e-mail or letter of interest to Ms. Velinda Nix, at U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, Acquisition Management, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL, 60611 or Velinda.nix@rrb.gov to be added to the bidder?s list.****Attachment 2 ?IT Technology Overview/Enterprise Architecture? will not be posted as an attachment due to potential sensitive information it contains.  For an overview of the RRB?s current information technology architecture, please contact me on your company?s letterhead requesting this information.

This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<ARCHDATE>08152007
<CONTACT>Herb Payne, 703-390-6472
<DESC>Project Description This project addresses the replacement of four billing systems (three for power and one for irrigation that serves sixteen irrigation projects) that are not integrated, and three of which are obsolete, with one cost effective current technology system that meets the needs of both BIA power and irrigation projects.  The benefits of utilizing one system are significant and include:  1.Increased efficiencies and/or productivity  2.Compliance with applicable federal laws (i.e., the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA)), which promotes standardization and allows for easier automatic interface capability with the BIA accounting system  3.Improved ability to meet Departmental, OMB, and BIA reporting requirements  4.Cost savings through server-based modernization Purpose  1.Standardization of billing systems 2.Compliance with applicable laws and regulations 3.Automated interface with the BIA accounting system 4.Replacement of existing manual or obsolete subsidiary systems/modules (i.e., staking, engineering analysis Business Assumptions -Existing service providers, custom designs and COTS products shall be considered. -If no satisfactory single solution can be identified, sources shall be sought for power and irrigation separately.  -If the solution includes a COTS product, then database administration and system administration resources shall be required to support implementation efforts and on-going system operation and maintenance.  A portion of the cost for these services is included in the estimated fees for this project. -An individual major application security plan shall be prepared as part of the project development lifecycle.  This shall include a risk assessment, threat analysis, physical, management, and operational controls, and a contingency plan.  The system shall conform to P.L. 100-235 and OMB circular A-130. -Funding for irrigation shall come from program funds. -Funding for power will come from power utility revenues. -The vendor shall provide a comprehensive training plan. Interfaces to External Systems  SPIBS shall interface to the BIA Trust Asset Accounting Management System (TAAMS).   SPIBS shall interface with the federal financial system of record. SPIBS shall interface with the U.S. Department of Treasury for referring delinquent debt. Background - Irrigation The National Irrigation Information Management System (NIIMS) is the legacy system used to assist BIA in the billing, collection and debt management processes for 16 irrigation systems located in the western United States.  The system generates, contains and manages the detail for the billing, collection and debt management of irrigation operation & maintenance (O&M), and it is a subsidiary to the Federal financial system of record of record, which houses the information at a summary level for regulatory reporting.   The irrigation systems, referred to as Projects, have debt related to O&M which are reimbursable to the federal government.  Each irrigation project is managed by the agency having operation and maintenance responsibility over the irrigation facilities involved.  NIIMS maintains the detail of accounting transactions for interfacing to the BIA Federal financial system of record.   By court order in December of 2001, the current NIIMS system, along with other systems considered to be at risk for breach of security and subject to unauthorized access, was taken offline.  The Court placed a restriction on all systems designated to contain Individual Indian Trust Data (IITD) eliminating internet access.  For NIIMS, this designation and the ensuing restrictions remain in effect.  The application resides on a secure intranet network Background - Power BIAs three power projects have either poorly designed, non-integrated, and/or outdated systems to satisfactorily meet the requirements of electrical utilities.  Two of the power projects systems perform billing and collections functions only and none of the three systems interface with the BIAs Federal financial system of record of record.  Two of the power projects are operated by BIA while the remaining power project is operated by a tribe under P.L. 93-638 contract.  Customers for all three power projects total nearly 40,000 accounts, comprising both Indian and non-Indian and span on and off-reservation.   Irrigation  Irrigation Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Assessments (Billing) The O&M charges are assessed on both trust and fee land that are designated as Presently Assessable (PA).  The information contained on the Project and Bureau parameter files as well as land, owner, lessee and verbiage information are used in the billing process. Basically, to determine the amount to be charged to each debtor, a calculation is made of the number of assessable acres in the tract, multiplied by the rate, multiplied by the share of ownership in the tract.  Some projects assess surcharges and minimum billing charges.  Rates shall be maintained historically, and are relevant to each bill year.  The lessee or owner is then responsible for payment of the charges levied on an annual basis.   Some projects stipulate minimum billing amounts in their Project parameter file.  Some projects stipulate surcharges, by bill or by unit/serial, or using any other criteria.  Most projects bill annually, although there some projects bill semi-annually.  Projects shall have the ability to issue bills outside of the annual processes to accommodate errors, late receipt of proper billing information, changes in land ownership, changes in leases and any information which impacts the validity of bills and which is received after the annual billing process is completed. Collection   SPIBS shall create a collection document using for cash collections and including a transaction code, batch number, document number, budget object code, revenue source code, principal payment, interest payment, penalty payment, administrative fees payment, individual payment. Transaction types: IC  Cash, check, money order IT  Appropriated funds payments N3010 funds to project IM- IPAC (Treasury fund transfer) Details of all transactions shall be traceable to the deposit and be reportable at any time.   Partial payments are allowed.     Payment Plans The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA) allows for an offer of a payment plan to individuals with delinquent accounts and who are determined by the O-i-C to be financially unable to pay.  Full payments not received by the due date specified in the payment plan (plus any defined grace period) are considered in default and shall be referred to Treasury. Payment plans may only be extended to landowners.   A payment plan is not allowed for debtors who have prior year delinquencies on the books.  If a debtor owes money, a payment plan shall be allowed after the debt is cleared.  If a debtor defaults on a payment plan, a future payment plan will not be allowed for six (6) years from the date of the default.

<DESC>Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Administrative Services Division/IT Contracting, 4700 River Road Unit 45, Riverdale, MD, 20737, UNITED STATES  USDA/APHIS/MRPBS/ASD/PDMCS has a need to seek vendors who can provide commercial off-the ?shelf (COTS) software that can meet the following Technical specifications: 
	Computerized Data Warehouse Software to include:
1.	Online Web Ordering
2.	Order Processing
3.	Procurement/Purchasing
4.	Inventorying/Warehousing
5.	Receiving
6.	Distribution
7.	Data query and reporting

APHIS, MRPBS, Printing, Distribution, Mail and Copier Solutions (PDMCS) distributes MRP publications to the public directly or through MRP agency sponsored events, where publications are presented to the public.  PDMCS stores and inventories approximately 500 publications and distributed over 2,800,000 copies last year.  The distribution of publications continues to grow as Legislative Public Affairs (LPA), Animal Care, Biotechnology Regulatory Services, Plant Protection & Quarantine, Veterinary Services, and Wildlife Services in APHIS develop and produce more publications.  

We are faced with the challenge that the current process for storing, inventorying, customers placing orders, fulfilling customer orders and distribution is manual and cumbersome. PDMCS requires a Web Ordering and Electronic Inventory system that would allow customers to request publications through an electronic ordering system (Web based) and provide tracking of the customer order by PDMCS.  The electronic system would also enable PDMCS to electronically track inventory on-hand and replenishment requirements, as well as, tracking receipts and shipments of publications to and from Riverdale, MD.

This Sources Sought intended which is intended to supplement the USDA?s procurement planning process. Any vendor responding to this request will need to submit commercial technical and cost data associated with their commercially available product and Company Information as follows: (l) Company Name and Address information: 1). Company contact information; 2) Product Name and related technical information/specifications; 3) Company size (LG, SB, etc),; 4) Published Product Technical specifications; 5)Commercial product listing information,either as open market, and/or under existing contract vehicles (GSA FSS, GWAC, etc) and, (6)Existing County, State, and or Federal Agencies currently using company product.  All information submitted will not be returned.  Please send requested information, via e-mail to the Small Business Coordinator (SBC), Estela M. Diaz at  Estela.M.Diaz@usda.gov. by the closing date of this publication. No telephone inquiries will be received.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Install Communications Duct Bank at NIH Bethesda, Maryland
<SOLNBR>NIHOF2007016
<RESPDATE>080907

<CONTACT>Aaron Crawford, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-3274, Fax 301-402-1103, Email crawfoa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY TO IDENTIFY OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES TO CONTINUE WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DUCT BANK AT NIH.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. 


The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Oneida Communications, Inc, 5400 Dower House Road, Upper Marlboro, Maryland 20772-3602, to perform Phase III and portions of Phases I and II to install the Communications Duct Bank at NIH Bethesda Campus.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238210 - Electrical Contractor, and the Small Business Size is $13 million.  The incumbent contractor graduated from the 8(a) Program in December 2006 and the current project still remains in the 8(a) Program unless released by the SBA to be performed by other firms outside of the 8(a) Program.  If it is determined that no interested 8(a) firm qualify to continue the uncompleted tasks, we will then request that SBA removes the project from the 8(a) Program.

The incumbent contractor previously installed the Underground Ductbank, furnished all cables, Network Monitoring Panels in Phase Communications Loop I and II; and is vary familiar with the layout of the NIH Underground System in the Bethesda Campus.  The upgrade of the NIH Fire Alarm and Emergency Mass Notification System became necessary after 9/11.  After 9/11 it was mandated that the Fire Alarm System in all building at NIH include the installation of Emergency Mass Notification System.  To provide flexibility and safer installation the project was divided into three (3) separate loops.  Each Loop serves several buildings, but reported directly to the main consoles located in Building 31 and 51.  Each console can operate independently if necessary.  Loops 1 and 2 were awarded under previous contracts to Oneida Communications, Inc., and only a portion of both loops need to be completed.  Loop 3 has not yet started.  

All work shall be completed and accepted by NIH no later than November 1, 2007.

As indicated above, the previous work pertaining to Phases I and II (loops 1 & 2) was awarded under previous contracts with a cumulative price of $6,340,060.00.  The incumbent contractor performed the majority of Loops I and II tasks while in the 8(a) program. The remaining work will remain in the 8(a) Program unless no other 8(a) firm qualifies to finish the remaining work, and the SBA releases the work from the 8(a) program. It is estimated that the remaining work will be between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000. The selected contractor must complete the remaining portion of loops 1 and 2 and all of Loop 3, and must guarantee the completed project (Loops 1, 2 & 3) free from defects for a period of one year from the date of acceptance.  This includes all Government furnished Network Monitoring Panel, Terminal Cabinets and the Network Cable.  

Since there are warranty issues involved, we believe Oneida Communications, Inc would be the only source to continue the work under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1, unless other interested 8(a) firms qualify to perform the remaining work and will provide the best value to the Government.  

This is a market survey to identify if there are qualified 8(a) firms with NAICS Code 238210 - Electrical Contractors, and small business size not exceeding $13, capable of performing the work described above.  This is not a request for proposal.  Interested firms must provide 2 copies of their qualification statements to reach this office not later than 3:30 p.m. EST, August 9, 2007.  Qualification statement must be sent by mail or courier - No fax or e-mail please.  Qualification statements must not exceed 20 single typed pages and must contain at least the information following information:

(1)	Company Name, address, Point of Contract and Telephone Number
(2)	DUNS Number and NAICS Code with Small Business Size and Type of Business (i.e., 8(a))
(3)	Provide Organization Chart and corresponding Resume of Key Personnel
(4)	Describe at least 3 relevant projects performed within the last 5 years ranging between one and three million dollars where you served as prime or sub contractor.
(5)	Provide two references (name, address and current telephone numbers) for each of the three relevant projects.
(6)	Show what major part each of the key personnel played in the completion of these projects. 
(7)	Describe your current bonding capacity

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) plans to solicit electrical supply services for the Armstrong-Jackman International Border Station (Border Station) in Jackman, Maine.  The facility is located at U.S. Route 201 and the International Point of Entry to the Province of Quebec, Canada.  This procurement will be conducted under the [Commercial Items/Negotiated] procedures in accordance with the FAR Part [12/15] and the contract term will be for a period of ten years.  The NAICS code for this service is 237130.  Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis publication to submit in writing to the above named point of contact, clear and convincing documentation of the company?s economic and technical capability to provide the required services.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining the responsibility status of the respondent firms.  This notice of intent is for the purpose of determining the availability of Contractors and not a request for competitive proposals.  The electric service will be required on December 31, 2008 and a Request for Proposal for this requirement will be determined at a later date based upon the estimated time requirement for environmental studies, right-of-way acquisition, state permitting procedures and utility construction. 

Background and Required Services

The existing Border Station currently receives single phase, 120/240 volt electrical service from Hydro-Quebec Distribution, the government-owned electrical distribution utility firm.  Due to a major renovation and expansion of the Border Station, three-phase, 120/208 volt, electric service will be required as a permanent electrical service.  The nearest known source of three phase electric distribution facilities are from the Central Maine Power Company in the vicinity of the town of Jackman, Maine and Hydro-Quebec Distribution on the Quebec province side of the International Boundary. In order to supply three-phase service a fifteen mile three-phase line extension from the nearest source of power will be required.

The estimated diversified electrical demand of the new facility is approximately 500 kilowatts and the estimated load factor is projected to be in excess of 50 percent based upon the estimated annual electrical usage of 329,000 kilowatt-hours.  The facilities to the Border Station shall meet the legal requirements of the local and/or state governmental bodies seeking approval and all facilities located on Government property shall be placed underground utilizing pad-mounted/submersible equipment suitable for surface/vault use.  

(OPTIONAL) While the GSA is seeking electrical service connected to an integrated power grid, the Government is willing to consider, but not obligated to accept, unique and innovative proposals to provide electric service to the facility.  Such approaches may include conventional or renewable generation or a combination of alternatives that would result in the quality of service that would be expected from a regulated electric service provider.  
 

Regulatory Status

The northern portion of Somerset County, Maine is not part of an existing utility supplier?s franchised service territory.  Currently, as a result of the facility?s regulatory status, no utility supplier or party has the responsibility or the absolute right to provide service to the Border Station.  Also, based upon preliminary discussions with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (Commission), it is unlikely that any party seeking to provide service to the Border station will be required to obtain its formal approval or obtain a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity to install facilities to the Border Station.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition & Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Eagleyard Photonics of Berlin, Germany for the purchase of laser diodes.

***Sole Source determination is based on NOAA's requirement for high performance distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes operating at 780 nm. The lasers must produce high power (at least 70 milliwatts) and be tunable. These lasers are necessary for the complex laser cooling system and to provide replacement for the limited lifetime laser. Eagleyard is the only vendor that offers laser diodes that meets our technical requirements. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NOAA requirement for the compact, solid state diode laser that is required for a small size of the miniature atomic clock.

***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Documentation should include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Division of Comparative Medicine of the National Center for Research Resources is conducting a market survey to assess the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms to develop an electronic directory of animal models resources and an associated web-based portal for accessing information at these resources for the project entitled: Knowledge-Based Resource for Linking Animal Models to Human Disease. The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size is 500 employees.  The purpose of the study is to develop better access to resources for animal models of human disease and enhance the ability to search across multiple animal models as well as to capture specific models information that may be relevant to multiple diseases.  One award is anticipated under a separate RFP.  The Contractor will be responsible for performing the following tasks related to creating an electronic directory: 1) Identify the sources where the data and information about animal models exist;  2) Create a comprehensive meta-model for collecting data about the sources, the models and the data;  3) Implement the meta-model in a database;  4) Populate the database with the actual data about the identified models;  5) Survey the market of users to facilitate data collection;  6) Develop a website with the description of the project;  7) Identify relevant standards, taxonomies and ontologies;  8)  Popularize the resource and develop tutorials and online help for new users and develop a model of community involvement; 9) Design a portal for integration of data, models and knowledge about animal models; 10) Develop a blueprint for integration of the electronic directory of models with existing knowledge structures; 11) Test potentially advantageous new methods for data and knowledge integration; and 12) Develop a 'tracking' system that will allow recording, managing and comparing various pathways of data and knowledge processing and integration. Small business firms having demonstrated experience in performing tasks 1-12 above are invited to submit capability statements (original and two copies).  Capability statements must provide evidence of experience in performing the tasks described above and demonstrate the following: 1) Qualifications and availability of personnel with experience pertinent to the development, maintenance and operation of the electronic directory and the associated portal as an independent and reliable source of information about disease models tools and resources, including interacting constructively with the animal models and related research resource communities;  2) Adequacy of the organizational and project management structure to ensure appropriate staffing, resources and management processes for each task;  3) Facilities, equipment and resources necessary for the performance of the requirements listed above; and 4) The firm?s status as a small business under NAICS code 541710.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should not include budgetary information.  The RFP release date is pending.  The government intends to negotiate one contract for a period of four years with an approximate award date of September 30, 2008.  Firms responding to this market survey should provide information pertinent to the requirements mentioned above within (15) calendar days from the date of this announcement to the address shown above.

<SUBJECT>B -- CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT SERVICES
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital-Abuth, PMB 1026 Shika Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, to continue to provide clinical research support services for the Prevalence of Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria and the Role of HIV/AIDS and Endemic Parasitic Infections in the Natural History of Pulmonary Hypertension in Sickle Cell Disease study.  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease in the world.  SCD is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting 70,000 to 80,000 Americans.  Secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been shown to have a prevalence of 30% in patients with SCD with mortality rates of 40% at 40 months after diagnosis in the United States.  The burden of disease of SCD is highest in Nigeria (West Africa) where approximately 4% of the 140 million people in that country are homozygous for SCD, but the prevalence and outcomes of pulmonary hypertension in Africa have not been investigated.  Many known infectious risk factors for PAH are also highly prevalent in Nigeria, including Human Immune Deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria, chronic hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and hookworm.  The first clinical hypothesis is that interactions between these infectious complications and sickle cell related hemolysis would lead to an even higher prevalence of PAH in Nigeria..  The study is therefore designed to determine the prevalence of PAH in Nigerian patients with SCD using echocardiographic measurements of the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity.  The Government aim to determine the associations and epidemiological interactions that might lead to PAH, of endemic infectious disease co-morbidities, especially HIV/AIDS, with SCD by screening for these infectious diseases in control subjects and in SCD patients with and without PAH.  This study will involve collaboration between the USA NIH and Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, Nigeria.    A major organ complication of SCD is secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  Many known infectious risk factors for  (PAH) are also highly prevalent in Nigeria, including Human Immuno Deficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), malaria, chronic hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and hookworm.  The overall goal of this project is to determine the prevalence of secondary, pulmonary hypertension in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia.  The project aims to determine the prevalence of HIV, malaria, hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis and hookworm in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia, and the interaction of HIV, malaria, hepatitis B and C, schistosomiasis, hookworm, and sickle cell anemia in (PAH) in Nigerian patients with sickle cell anemia.  And to confirm a genetic diagnosis for sickle ?-globin syndromes and ?-thalassemia syndromes in this cohort as a point of reference for future genotype-phenotype studies, and  using both candidate gene and genome wide association approaches, NHLBI along with ABUTH will identify and selectively characterize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes important for endothelial function and vascular inflammation, and identifying genetic proteomic risk factors associated with pulmonary hypertension in SCA using this study?s genotyping approaches.  

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital(ABUTH) in Zaria, Nigeria is the only known source that is currently able to assist the NIH, NHLBI, Vascular Medicine Branch in this area of research.  An award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

The expected period of performance is one (1) month from the date of the award.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6, Competition Requirements.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 541990 with a size standard of  $6.5 M.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 
1.	 SCOPE: This Performance Work Statement (PWS) defines the effort required for the design, development, delivery, and evaluation of curriculum materials for Aerospace Science: Global and Cultural Studies (AS-200) Instructional DVD and Instructor CD. The materials shall consist of a DVD and CD.  This PWS includes the associated curriculum format and content, project management, and product planning requirements.

1.1.	Introduction: The Curriculum Division of the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS/CR) is the executive agent for Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) curriculum. AFOATS/CR supports AFJROTC?s mission of developing ??citizens of character dedicated to serving their nation and community?. Additionally, the objectives of AFJROTC are to educate and train high school cadets in citizenship; promote community service; instill responsibility, character, self-discipline; and provide instruction in air and space fundamentals.

1.2.	Background: AFOATS/CR is in the process of developing an instructional DVD and an Instructor CD for the Air Force Junior ROTC program to inject educational awareness of world affairs, regional studies and cultural awareness into its high school citizenship building program. Market research reveals that the only body of materials that adequately address these areas, with the visual aids, lesson plans and required regional studies topics, is an area studies series produced by the Southern Center for International Studies (SCIS).  The SCIS series uses the features AFOATS needs to facilitate the learning process for its high school population?visual aids, hands-on activities and exciting, current day subject matter.   The SCIS package delivers a thorough study of the different regions of the world with hands-on activities injected into the courseware to excite students about their world environment, political issues facing the planet and the different cultures and peoples that make up their world.  These features all perfectly match the AFOATS? goal for this program.  SCIS material is already in use by the junior and senior ROTC and OTS programs within AFOATS, including the instructional guide and videos produced by SCIS for this series.  The purpose of the instructional DVD is to train AFJROTC instructors on how to teach the material and the purpose of the Instructor CD is to increase student learning and retention by adding visual support materials to the presentation of the course content and electronic copy of the already developed student workbook.  The DVD will equip the instructors with the knowledge needed to teach the course and give them the ammunition they need to enter the classroom feeling knowledgeable which will in-turn raise their self-confidence and enhance their enthusiasm.  The CD will increase the students learning and retention by adding visual support materials to the presentation of the course content and provide the instructors with electronic version of the existing hard copy student workbook for use in developing exams and other classroom needs. 

1.2.1.	The source for the instructional DVD and Instructor CD is the SCIS World in Transition Educational Series, published by The Southern Center for International Studies, 320 West Paces Ferry Road, N.W., Atlanta GA 30305.  The specific sections to be used as the primary sources from which the instructional DVD and Instructor CD are to be developed include: Europe in Transition, The Middle East in Transition, South Asia in Transition, East Asia in Transition, Africa in Transition, and Latin America in Transition.

<SUBJECT>W -- XEROX LEASE RENEWAL AGREEMENT
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue a delivery order against a GSA Contract Number GS-25F-0062L to Xerox Corporation, 1301 K Street NW, Ste 300W, Washington, DC 20005 on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The proposed procurement is a renewal to an existing contract that will expire 31 Aug 2007 in which the Government is committed to a 5-year lease agreement renewable yearly.  The Xerox DocuColor DC8000 print center is not meant for day-to-day administrative or office use, but rather required training equipment for the U.S. Marine Corps Lithography course being taught at Defense Information School (DINFOS).  Students are required to learn to operate and maintain this particular printing system, and DINFOS Basic Lithography courses? lesson plan is built based upon it.  The DC8000 is the main component of a standardized and fielded USMC print production system (TIPS).  This system is in use throughout the Corps in deployed areas, and the fixed station print facilities have begun to modernize to this same product.  Leasing equipment, rather than purchasing, allows DINFOS to more quickly react to changes in the field.  Life cycle for these presses would have to be pushed out to approximately 8 years with a purchase (cost factors), whereas, with a lease, they can be cycled for new products at the 5-year point with little or no additional budget impact.

<SUBJECT>B --  Consistent Library Lookup and Retrieval System
<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE:  Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intent to contract by other than full and open competition in the development of Consistent Library Lookup and Retrieval System in Support. NOAA intends to award a sole source a contract to Texas A & M Research Foundation, 3578 University Drive, College Station, TX. The anticipated contract will be a follow on cost reimbursable contract and will include a base year plus one (1) one-year option period.  The applicable North American Industry Classification code is 541710, size standard is 500 employees.  

The work to be performed is for developing the radiative transfer model to be used in estimating cloud properties from the GOES-R sensor. The contract will utilize the services of Texas A & M Research Foundation for research and development of the GOES-R Algorithm Working Group. The Texas A & M Research Foundation provides unique experience that is unavailable within NESDIS.  Only he can provide the computations that we need. The Texas A & M Research Foundation has a long collaboration with NOAA and its institutes.  They have a team of scientists from NOAA, NASA and academia working on the cloud algorithms from GOES-R. They also have an expert in the area of light scattering by non-spherical particles (ice crystals, in particular). Over years, they have developed various state of the art light scattering computational models. The optical properties of ice crystals which their team has simulated have been of great utility to the atmospheric radiative transfer community. These simulations of the optical properties of ice crystals that have been used in the NASA MODIS operational ice cloud retrieval. Therefore the Texas A & M Research Foundation a critical role in our project which relies heavily on their expertise.  Because of the Texas A & M Research Foundations extensive experience in light scattering computation, radiative transfer simulation, and remote sensing, the Texas A & M Research Foundation is the only appropriate contractor for this project.

Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a notice of intent to sole source only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NOAA.

United States Army Training and Doctrine Command Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) Accelerated & Capabilities Developments Directorate Science & Technology Division 30 Ingalls Road, Building 138, Room 10, Fort Monroe, Virginia 23651  TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION EXCHANGE-REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.   The United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), ARCIC, is continuing its Technology Information Exchange (TIE) program. One aspect of this program is to establish dialogue with indus try on corporate/company Independent Research and Development projects relating to identified Army Force Operating Capabilities (FOCs). This program brings industry/corporate/company representatives together with the TRADOC ARCIC for a dialogue session on emerging technologies and desired Army force capabilities. Each TIE session is a distinct and separate presentation intended to facilitate a discussion between industry and the ARCIC at the executive level on a companys independent research and developmen t projects. A General Officer or equivalent from the ARCIC will host each session and the intent is to provide input to help industry focus their R&D programs (without any financial reimbursement) towards existing and future Army capabilities, to the benef it of both industry and the U.S. Army. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION but is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(b).  TRADOC, ARCIC will use the responses to the RFI to determine what emerging technologies may be available in the mark et place. RFIs are used to gather information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement. This is not a request for contractual offers and information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract. Respondents t o this RFI will not be reimbursed for the information they provide to the ARCIC. This is not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research but is a request for information from companies already conducting independent research and developmen t in relevant areas. Only those companies with demonstrated success in their independent R&D programs to address Department of Defense warfighting capabilities are requested to respond. TRADOC Pamphlet 525-66 is the base document that describes the war fig hting objective capabilities that the Army desires in its current to future force. The capability areas are: Battle Command, Joint Operational Environment Understanding (JOEU), Mounted/Dismounted Maneuver, Air Maneuver, Line of Sight/Beyond Line of Sight ( LOS/BLOS), Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) Lethality for Mounted/Dismounted Operations,  Maneuver Support, Protection, Strategic Responsiveness & Deployability, Maneuver Sustainment, Training, Leader Development & Education, and Human Dimension. A detailed descri ption of each Force Operating Capability can be obtained by accessing the TRADOC Web site using the following instructions:  1. Go to http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pamndx.htm  2. Once the page opens scroll down to 525-66 and CLICK on the PDF or DOC button on the right to download. Additional information may be available after coordination with the TIE coordinator (listed below) and verification of an active Industrial Security P rogram with the USG. When responding to this Request For Information provide a brief description and depth of the company independent R&D program, a brief description (one page) of past R&D success satisfying DOD capability needs, a br ief description (one to two pages) on each of the R&D programs/projects that apply directly to Army Force Operating Capabilities, and points of contact list for further coordination if necessary.

Phases II & III will conduct laboratory evaluations of the proposed technologies, and are scheduled to occur at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), UT beginning on or about 9 October 2007, for up to four wee ks in duration. All contractors selected in Phase I are encouraged to participate in the subsequent phases. Phase III will evaluate the technologies capability for automated identification of inactivated antigens in Formulated Tap Water. This testing will  be scored separately from the Phase II portion of the TRE and will commence after Phase II testing has completed. All questions concerning the TRE should be submitted to the US Army Technology Readiness Evaluation Team, monica.kelley1@us.army.mil. Format is plain text.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued. 

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to enter into negotiations on a sole source basis with SUNAIR Electronics Inc., 3005 S.W. Third Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33315 to provide: (1) Upgrades to at least 95 current Sunair RT-9000 transceivers from version A to version B, (2) Upgrades to at least 95 current remote control units RCU-9310 from version A to version B, and (3) At least 25 additional RT-9000 version B, RCU-9310 version B and CU-9125 radios. The proposed acquisition will be for one (1) base year with two (2) one-year options. 

In 1997, USCG began a multi-year effort to re-capitalize and modernize all shore-based and shipboard low power HF radios. In 2000, through a full and open competition, Sunair Electronics Inc. was awarded a five-year contract to supply USCG with the low power HF radios. Along with additional purchases,  the current radios need to be upgraded in order to meet the new technology requirements called the Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) and only Sunair Electronics Inc. can provide the upgrades as well as the proprietary software for current and future support. Acquiring the upgrades from another vendor would not be cost effective, since there would be proprietary information involved.  Without these upgrades, there is the danger of miscommunication between the USCG command centers and the USCG ships out in the sea. 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334220. Delivery will be made to the United States Coast Guard Engineering and Logistic Center (ELC), Baltimore MD.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  All capability statements received by 3:00 PM EST on 21 March 2007 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determination whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPRATION AND SUMBISSION OF DATA OR OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT!!

    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

is held? 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

?Inverted Domestic Corporation.? A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of quotes:

(1) QUOTERS are responsible for submitting quotes, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that quotes or revisions are due.

(2)(i) Any quote, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an quote received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quote would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--

(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of quotes; or

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotes cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of quotes by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of quotes will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(5) Quotes may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of quotes. Oral quotes in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotes and issue a purchase order and a resultant contract without negotiations with quoters. Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations, with one, some, or all quoters, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all quotes if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received.

<DESC>Statement of Work-USCG Aviation Training Requirements 

1.0  Scope Of Work:  This Statement Of Work describes the vessel and personnel required to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Miami, FL.  The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard?s aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting and fixed wing aerial delivery evolutions by Air Station aircraft. 

1.1  Background:  One of the Coast Guard?s primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment to/from underway vessels, helicopter delivery/recovery of rescue swimmers to/from the water, and fixed wing aerial delivery of dewatering pumps and other equipment to the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guard?s increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.  

1.2  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 38 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 11 foot beam.  The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet.  Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 10 tons. 

1.2.1  Other Characteristics:  The vessel must have an enclosed cabin large enough to accommodate the entire crew during transit.  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or ?dead in the water?.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g. antennas).

1.2.2  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 64 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

1.2.3  Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, radar, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20 NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Miami Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

1.2.4  Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C. to 40 degrees C. (41 degrees F. to 105 degrees F.).  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

1.2.5  Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will also be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a one hour transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

1.2.6  Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer?s technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and / or local regulations.

1.3  Personnel:  All contractor personnel are required to be U. S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.

1.3.1  Point Of Contact:  The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time.  The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

1.3.2  Crew:  Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands.  The crew shall be currently trained in rescue techniques and water survival.  Each of the crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and for aerial delivery equipment pickup as well as any required rescue operations.

1.3.2.1  Coxswain:  The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.  

1.3.2.2  Deckhands: The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

1.4  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:

1.4.2  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be the shoreline out to 15 nautical miles from one of the following inlets: Port Everglades, Bakers Haulover, Hillsboro Inlet or Government Cut.  The specific inlet will be determined by the contractor at the commencement of the contract and may be changed by the contractor with two weeks prior notification to the COTR.

The operational log will also be used to verify the contractor?s timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a deduction in the charter hire.   Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR or QAE.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for technical support services described below.  The Performance Work Statement is as follows:  

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

I.  Background

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is providing technological leadership to semiconductor and equipment manufacturers and other government agencies by developing the methods, tools, and artifacts needed to apply leading edge, high-resolution atom-based dimensional measurement methods to meet the metrology needs of semiconductor microlithography  well as nanolithography needs of nanomanufacturing.  One specific goal is to provide the American industry with the techniques and standards needed to make traceable dimensional measurements on wafers and other artifacts with nanometer accuracy. The NIST Precision Engineering Division is developing three-dimensional structures of controlled geometry whose dimensions can be measured and traced directly to the intrinsic crystal lattice.  These samples are intended to be dimensionally stable to allow transfer to other measurement tools which can measure the artifacts with dimensions known on the nanometer scale.

This requirement is for research and the development of specific elements of the Atom based Dimensional Metrology project.  The requirement is for expertise in the development of the metrology techniques and sample preparation at the atomic scale.  This requirement will require expertise in several key elements of scientific and hardware associated with imaging silicon at the atomic scale, modifying silicon surfaces and preparing silicon substrates for atomic scale imaging and modification

II. Scope of the Work

The key elements of the research and deliverables are focused on the development of metrology techniques for nanomanufacturing and fabrication techniques for the nanolithography of atom-based standards, and metrology based on atomic scale imaging.  The contractor shall develop advanced sample preparation for ultra-high vacuum measurement of the crystal lattices in silicon surfaces as prepared using wet chemical methods and high temperature processing.  This aspect of the research contract, and specifically the silicon surface preparation and silicon step flow dynamics work depends on the extensive expertise of the contractor.  The contractor must also maintain and develop NIST?s wet chemistry methods for preparing silicon wafer samples with atomically flat and ordered surfaces. 

This project and its deliverables require a detailed understanding of the surface preparation and hydrogen termination physics of silicon surfaces which enables repeatable sample preparation and development of nanometer scale lithography.  This work is intended to enable new metrology methods for semiconductor manufacturing and nanometer-scale fabrication.  

The work in this contract is for the development of atom-based line width standards to assist in the calibration of line width metrology tools which can be used in conjunction with accurately measured tips to measure feature critical dimensions.  This research is intended to enable the accurate counting of atom spacing?s across a feature in a controlled environment and to subsequently transfer that artifact to other measuring instruments as a structure with atomically known dimensions.  

An essential element of this project is the fabrication of test artifacts and structures for the development of high resolution imaging methods.  It is imperative to enable fabrication methods for sub-10 nm sized features.  Several recent developments in optical microscopy, scatterometry and scanning electron microscopy metrology require test samples with critical dimensions below 10 nm.  These test structures are simply not available at this time.  In this fabrication effort NIST is developing the methods for fabrication of sub-10 nm sized features and etching methods to transfer these patterns into the silicon substrates.

This requirement is to maintain and develop a new ultra high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV STM) system.  There are several key components which have been installed on this new system and their operation needs further verification.  The new system components are commercially available hardware such as the sample heater and tip processing station mounted in the UHV environment which has LEED and Auger surface analysis capabilities.  The completion of this work includes the verification of alignment for the transfer mechanism for sample and tip transfer.  The new atomic resolution STM has a coarse positioning system and an in situ optical setup allowing tip positioning with respect to the sample. The STM system needs performance verification and implementation for positioning silicon samples with etched features or prepared surfaces in appropriate positions within the STM field of view.

III. Specific Tasks:

I.	The contractor shall use the optical vision system and capture images with the vision system as directly mounted on the STM vacuum facility.  The system shall have the capability to see and acquire vision-based images of the STM tip on approach and on nominal relative position of the tip and sample.  The contractor shall use the appropriate samples supplied by NIST to demonstrate this capability in the standard operation of this UHV tunneling microscope.  This will include evaluation of STM calibration.  The contractor shall demonstrate STM and vision system resolution for target positioning and imaging.  The contractor shall test and demonstrate the operational alignment and positioning system to enable the tunneling measurement process in the desired target area.  This is accomplished by verifying the installed positioning components.  Verification and demonstration of STM imaging performance at the atomic scale on silicon samples. The contractor shall provide images and data verifying the system performance.  The contractor shall perform the standard UHV vacuum testing procedures and nitrogen testing procedures used throughout the UHV industry to ensure the vacuum system does not leak to the 10-10 torr level.  

II.	The contractor shall characterize, and calibrate the atomic resolution imaging capability.  The contractor shall demonstrate and acquire atomic resolution images on silicon and wet chemistry prepared samples which verify system performance.  This system shall be tested and evaluated by the contractor in the existing UHV STM environment to ensure performance of the entire system and an acceptable electronic noise floor and vibration floor.  The contractor shall perform STM measurements with the high temperature sample preparation capability which will enable atomic resolution of silicon samples.  The contractor shall verify sample and tip preparation using this approach. The contractor shall image the atomically resolved surfaces and attempt atom counting dimensional measurements.  A detailed evaluation and report of atom counting results shall be provided by the contractor. 

III.	The contractor shall develop improved nanofabrication methods, which yield smaller feature sizes than previously fabricated, which are based on the STM methods in a vacuum environment.  The key deliverable in this work is the development of wet chemistry methods for silicon processing and lithography on the nanometer scale and their subsequent etching.  The deliverable will be a methodology for preparing hydrogen the surfaces as described and for a specific and operational etching technique which has an improved set of etching parameters to extend the lithography technique to beyond sub-10 nm.  The contractor shall develop processing methods to enable etching of silicon features at the sub-10 nm dimension.  The actual patterning results using STM written features will be treated with subsequent external etching by reactive ion etching (RIE).  This work involves the contractor writing features on silicon substrates through the removal of hydrogen from the hydrogen terminated surfaces.  The removal of hydrogen atoms and exploration to improve the understanding of this nanofabrication process is an essential part of this phase.  It is a key aspect of this section to extend the work to the atomic domain using modified silicon surfaces with features written through the removal of hydrogen bonds.  After completion of the lithography process, the contract shall investigate a technique for the etch mask formation and RIE etching process.  The contractor may use an alternative etch mask using alternative termination chemistries such as alcohol bonding.  This aspect will require researching and developing a strategy to create alternative surface lithography chemistry.  The main approach is the improved surface terminations t the atomic scale and subsequent developed of surface preparation and etch mask creation at the atomic scale.  The contractor may use an alternative surface termination in this portion of the effort.    

IV.	The contractor shall publish the results of the nanofabrication and atom counting research in the appropriate scientific forum, such as Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology (JVST) or Applied Physics Letters.  The completion of the above development of nanofabrication methods shall be published in the appropriate scientific forums such as the JVST or The Journal of Applied Physics.  Upon completion of the contract, results shall be provided to NIST for presentation material at one International Sematech metrology workshop.  Also, the contractor shall provide support by means of complete documentation of the data and images and figures of the work completed under this contract for use in any related publications by NIST staff, which arises from the development of and research into silicon surface preparation, silicon step and terrace surface dynamics and nanofabrication.  The contractor shall make available modeling and results showing silicon surface preparation methods which account for the understanding of surface defects encountered in creating suitable atomically flat and ordered silicon surfaces.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for survey of Hawaii based longline fishermen to obtain information regarding cetacean depredation and reporting events in the Hawaii-based longline fishery; Honolulu, Hawaii.
Background

Fisheries depredation (removal of fish from fishing gear) by toothed whales is a widespread problem in many oceans of the world. The negative impacts of depredation include economic losses to fishermen, increased pressure on fish stocks, and injury or mortality of whales caused by deterrent methods, entanglement, or accidental hooking. 

The Hawaii-based longline fishery consists of two separately managed components: the deep-set (tuna-target) fishery and the shallow-set (swordfish-target) fishery.  It is a limited access fishery with 164 permits that are transferable.  In 2006, 127 Hawaii-based longline vessels were active in the deep-set fishery, and 35 vessels were active in the shallow-set fishery.  The deep-set fishery operates year-round.  

The Hawaii-based longline fishery is experiencing increasing interactions and depredation events involving small cetaceans, specifically false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) and pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus).  The goal of this contract is to gather Hawaii-based longline fishermen knowledge regarding these cetacean depredation events, such as methods used to avoid depredation and the locations where depredation more frequently occurs.  This information should be gathered through informal dockside surveys and individual conversations with the fishermen. 

Deliverables 

TASK 1 - DEVELOPMENT OF SURVEY AND REPORT 

Develop initial project survey methodology and general framework of final report for review and approval of NMFS? staff (in order to ensure consistency of expectations for the project).

 
TASK 2 ? SURVEY IMPLEMENTATION    
Conduct informal dockside surveys of Hawaii-based longline fishermen (including various ethnic components thereof) in order to gather full-range of knowledge and experiences regarding cetacean depredation events, such as methods used to avoid depredation and the locations where depredation more frequently occurs.  

TASK 3 ? REPORT    
 
Prepare a worthwhile and appropriate report which summarizes the data and findings of the surveys; report should comport with agreed upon expectations as developed under TASK 1.

Performance Period

TASK 1 - The period of performance for this task is from contract issuance to November 1, 2007.

TASKS 2 and 3 ? The period of performance for these tasks is from November 1, 2007 to April 1, 2007.

NOTE: Dates are approximate and subject to extension at the discretion of NMFS.

NOTE:     Offerors interested in submitting a quote on this acquisition should obtain a copy of (1) Standard Form 1449 (2) Schedule,(3) Representations and Certifications, and (4) Past Performance form. Offers must include with their offer an originally signed SF-1449, a completed schedule, a completed copy of the annual representations and certifications at https://orca.bpn.gov, and past performance form.

This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<SOLNBR>07-148EJB
<RESPDATE>080107
<ARCHDATE>08162007
<CONTACT>Emria Briscoe, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email briscoee@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This amendment is in response to Questions and Answers for RFQ NLM-07-148/EJB
 
1.	Is there an incumbent contractor in place supporting the RCDC efforts to date? 
Answer:  There are no incumbents currently in place for change management activities for the RCDC effort.

2.	Should offerors propose areas for incentives, and performance requirements, or will they be defined in the purchase order? 
Answer:  Offerors should feel free to propose areas for incentives and performance requirements.

3.	Is the RCDC system currently in use, or is the pilot work being done using another IT system? 
Answer:  The RCDC system is currently in use, but the system is still undergoing improvements that are necessary before the system can meet all functionality requirements.

4.	In section 1.0 b, the RFQ indicates an award date of August 17, 2007 and a six-month period of performance for Phase I which would seem to put the end date at January 17, 2008.  The recommended completion date for Phase 1 in section 2.1 is December 31, 2007. Can the Government please clarify the desired period of performance? 
Answer:  The completion date for the tasks of Phase 1 is December 31, 2007 which will allow the government time to request changes, clarifications, or edits before the completion period ending on January 17, 2008.

5.	Will the government provide facilities for the entire project team or should the contractor plan on performing at the contractor?s location with the exception of interviews, meetings and focus group sessions? 
Answer:  The contractor will work at the contractor?s location with the exception of interviews, meetings and focus group sessions.  That said we hope to provide a small number of work spaces (1 to 2) for the contractor when meetings/interviews are required.  Those spaces would not be permanent, full time work spaces.

6.	In section 3.0 Deliverables, ICO Assessments: Chapter Summaries are required 
monthly.  Could you please clarify expectations on the details for the summaries for the Aug 31st, since the project start date is Aug 17th?
Answer:  As the ICO assessments are conducted, the RCDC management requires a summary of the findings; ?chapter summary? consisting of resulting information from each of the ICOs contacted that month for the delivery items in sections 2.1.1 ? 2.1.5.  The goal of the ?Chapter Summary? is a document from which the RCDC team (with input from the contractor) can begin to evaluate and modify the ways in which we conduct business with the ICOs.  

7.  Initial phases of any Change Management effort requires that agency prepare for
Change.  Has a Change Management team been developed?  Has the sponsorship model been developed?
Answer:  No designated ?Change Management? team has been developed, but there are several cross-agency teams and staff that are involved in the RCDC project.  No known formal ?sponsorship model? has been developed.

8.  Is the NIH already working with a systems integrator for the pilot implementation of the RCDC system? If yes, who is that?
Answer:  If you are referring to an IT systems integrator, we have an IT system development team that is working to ensure integration of the tool with other IT enterprise applications.

9. Is the NIH Office of Strategic Management and Planning (OSMP) involved in this project currently? Is their involvement planned? If yes, how will they be involved?
Answer:  No, but they are aware of it.

10. Has any change management work been performed by NIH or external contractor as part of the pilot?
Answer: Yes, but it has been carried out informally by NIH staff.

11. Should our RFP response address Phase II Tasks as well as Phase I?  If the answer is yes, there are two constraints to the response: page count and ability to effectively cost the project with the knowledge that ?Government review of Task I outcomes will determine resource allocation between ICO change management responsibilities and purchase order roles.? Can you provide instruction on how the NIH would like these constraints to be addressed so there is consistency in responses (allowing straight forward comparative evaluation)?
Answer:  The RFP response should only address Phase I Tasks.  A deliverable at the completion of Phase I tasks (2.1.8) is the cost proposal for Phase II.  The Government understands that a true costing of Phase II tasks is not possible without a thorough understanding of the outcome of Phase I Tasks.

<DESC>This solicitation is amended to change the requirement from brand name to brand name or equal pursuant to FAR 52.211-6 and add the following salient characteristics: * The Computer Radiography system must include software tailored specifically for industrial applications that complies with DICOM/DICONDE standards. Software layout must be available to be configured for various classes of users, such as inspectors and su pervisors. Configurable features include: Data Selector and Pictoral Index for rapid image identification; View Port with variable magnifier for reviewing related images and making comparisons to a master image or historical data; Workflow for routing, arc hiving and deleting images; Toolbar and short-cut keys providing access to key functions; user Defined Stamps for streamlined image sentencing. * The CR system must employ re-usable and flexible 14 x 17 inches imaging plates and a CR Reader to capture and digitally redout penetrating radiation. The re-usable imaging plates must consist of storage phosphor coated on a flexible cassetee similar to f ilm and can be used with lead or other suitable intensifiers for various applications. The CR system must be able to create a latent image through an electron trapping process. The latent image should be read by the CR Reader through photo-stimulated lumin escence (PSL) process. The PSL should be electronically measured and a digital phosphor density computed for each position on the screen. The computed image should be viewable and analyzed on the workstation. The scanned imaging plate should be able to be erased with a Phosphor Eraser for re-use. * The CR system must have a Phosphor Scanner that allows to read and erase both standard and custom-sized phosphor imaging plates. The scanner should be a compact, portable tabletop CR scanner. The Phosphor Scanner should be able to scan as low as 50 micro ns and have the widest dynamic range on the market today. The CR scanner should have the ability to scan multiple small-width imaging plates (IPs) simultaneously. The scanner software should be able to recognize when multiple IPs have been loaded and creat e an individual image file for each IP. * In addition the CR system must include: Fully ASTM DICONDE compliant system with 70+ page compliancy statement; Data Sharing ability to send DICONDE files between review stations for remote expert review; Automatic Report Generator functionality, customi zable MS Word gerated reports from images and data collected; Reference Radiographs  ability to input ASTM digital reference radiographs and use for comparison purposes; Ability to burn DICONDE files to CD/DVD in order to be viewable with any DICOM/DICOND E viewer; Two (2) separate software modules  1) One that acquires images and builds important technique and inspection image data and 2) One that receives images from the first module and allows for imaging/analysis review of the images along with opening  workflows for rework and further review; Ability to scan imaging plates and review previous images at the same time from a single workstation. * Delivery, installation and training must be included with this system. * The CR software must be able to perform computer-assisted wall thickness measurement to detect local corrosion in projection radiographs. The measurement results should be saved and a report generated in Microsoft Word. The CR software should allow users  to select an area around a porosity and automatically calculate the loss of material / area measurement of the defect. The software should be able to reproduce the conventional film method of putting two or three different sensitivity films on top of one another and shooting a part, then analyzing the different depths available. This tool should be able to split the dynamic range of the selected radiographic image into two or three exclusive partitions for better visualization and analysis of image feature s. The CR software should be able to detect depth m easurement, allowing users to measure the material loss of a defect, similar to the Wall Thickness penetration measurement. * The CR system should include a report generator module which allows to build customized reports of the findings. All clauses still apply. Offers must be signed, dated and received by 5:00 PM EST, Monday 30 July 2007 via fax at 410-306-3829 or email at robin.donovan@us.army.mil at the US Army Contracting Agency, Directorate of Contracting, ATTN: SFCA-NR-APC-T, 4118 Su squehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, 21005-3013.
