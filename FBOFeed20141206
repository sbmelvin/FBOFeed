<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p>11. STATEMENT OF WORK/POSITION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>I. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>A. Introduction:</p>
<p>The Democracy, Human Rights and Governance sector in Liberia faces a complex set of challenges. Liberia has experienced greater stability and security since 2005 and enjoys considerable freedom of expression and association and a significantly improved human rights environment. However, significant challenges in improving government accountability and rule of law, as well as political accountability and competition remain. The consequences of the lack of accountability manifest themselves in continued corruption and impunity at every level of government, including within the court system, which combined with a general lack of capacity, has resulted in low public confidence in government. Lack of political accountability and competition have resulted in continued executive dominance and the inability of the legislature and judiciary to act as checks on the executive. The citizenry remain uninformed while civil society remains weak, making it difficult for society to address these constraints.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, USAID/Liberia's Democracy, Rights and Governance (DRG) Office supports more effective, accountable and inclusive governance, by strengthening accountable management of public resources, increasing access to justice, strengthening capacity to implement election processes, and building civil society and media's capacity to exercise their advocacy and oversight roles. Land governance is a cross-cutting focus of USAID Liberia, managed by the DRG Office, in close coordination with the Economic Growth (EG) Office, particularly the EG Natural Resource Management Team.</p>
<p>The Democracy, Rights and Governance Office presently has an average annual budget of $30 million and a staff of ten, consisting of six Americans and four Liberians. The office is implementing programs in good governance, rule of law and access to justice, elections and political processes, and civil society and media.</p>
<p>B. Position Objective and Principal Tasks:</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to obtain the services of a Land Governance Advisor to provide technical support to the USAID/Liberia Democracy, Rights and Governance (DRG) Team for the implementation of the Mission's Land Governance Project.</p>
