While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. The required delivery is 150 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong><br />The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <strong>Disposable Patient Clothing on or about January 2013,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.
<p>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of items</strong> being solicited could include, but are not limited to, Disposable Patient Clothing, adult disposable gowns and shorts in sizes ranging from small to 3XL, and pediatric disposable gowns in sizes from infant to adolescent, that are single use, latex free, low linting or lint free, with basic or light fluid resistance. Clothing must be constructed of nontoxic flame resistant material such as cotton and polyester woven fabric, or nonwoven material, available in colors and white. The product line will include at a minimum the specific products listed in Technical/Company Requirements. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $446,498.47.</p>
<p>NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. <strong>Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br /></strong>Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Flight Inspection Services (AJW-393) has a requirement for BE-300 King Air Strip, Prime, and Painting Services.  This is a market survey for BE-300 King Air Strip, Prime, and Painting Services required in accordance with the attached draft statement of work.
The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of fulfilling this requirement. 
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.

The crystals will also be processed under various atmospheres for refining, including running under a reducing Ar+H atmosphere. Containterless zone melting and refining is required to avoid contamination from crucible materials. The technique must result in purity equivalent to or greater than that of the starting alloy. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)   6.302-1, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 5, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic ground testing and data analysis.	This effort consists of planning and conducting experiments to simulate vehicles in flight and to understand the environments imposed on flight vehicles. NASA/JSC intends to purchase this service from Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC).  CUBRC possesses several capabilities that make it unique from other wind tunnel testing facilities.  These capabilities include (1) the ability to instrument test models with very small and densely spaced instrumentation to measure heat transfer rates, (2) the ability to test at enthalpy levels most representative for a ground test facility, (3) the ability to test at free stream Mach numbers up to Mach 30, (4) the ability to test very large model sizes with adequate test duration to allow for flow establishment around the model.  Other testing facilities have one or more of the unique capabilities listed above, however, the CUBRC facilities are unique in that they possess all of the required capabilities. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 8th, 2012.

<DESC>THE PROPOSED CONTRACT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for preparation of Navy and Marine Corps National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other environmental planning related processes/documents.  The primary focus will be for NEPA and other environmental planning projects located in the desert, upland, and mountain environments.  The secondary focus will be for NEPA and other environmental planning related projects located in other environments necessary to meet mission requirements.
  Primary work locations will include California, Nevada, and Arizona; however, the preponderance of work is anticipated to be located within California.  There is the possibility of work being located anywhere in the United States.  Tasks will include data collection, natural resources surveys, and resource effects analysis work related to NEPA and other environmental planning tasks.  Work will include, but is not limited to, the preparation of the following primary NEPA related documents:  Environmental Assessments (EAs); Environmental Impact Statements (EISs); draft Findings of No Significant Impact (FONSIs); and draft Records of Decision (RODs).  These NEPA related documents will address the following resource areas as applicable for each project:  topography, geology, and soils; water resources; biological resources; air quality, greenhouse gasses, and climate change; noise; airspace; cultural resources; socioeconomics (including environmental justice); land use; coastal zone management (Coast Zone Management Act compliance); transportation/traffic; utilities and utility corridors; public health and safety (including hazardous materials, protection of children from environmental health risks and safety risks, and anti-terrorism and force protection); visual quality; public services; and other important resource areas and considerations.

As part of, or in addition to, preparing NEPA related documents, the contractor may conduct other environmental studies and prepare other environmental planning related documents including, but not limited to, the following categories:  Plans, Studies, and Preliminary Designs; Aeronautical Related Studies/Projects; Airfield and Airspace Effects Analyses; Biological Resources Effects Analyses; Topography, Geology, and Soils Effects Analyses; Air Quality/Climate Change Effects Analyses; Noise Effects Analyses; Cultural Resources Effects Analyses; Water Quality and Hydrology Effects Analyses; Socioeconomics and Community Services Effects Analyses; Land Use Effects Analyses; Coastal Resources Effects Analyses; Transportation/Traffic Effects Analyses; Utilities Analyses; Public Health and Safety Effects Analyses; Visual Quality Effects Analyses; Ecological Services and General Ecological Plans; Preliminary Facility and Utility Infrastructure Studies; Project Public Participation Planning and Implementation; and Other Important Considerations.

The contract term is for a one-year base period with four one-year option periods.
  The total amount that may be ordered under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $30 million for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee of $5,000 for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the contract at the sole discretion of the Government.  The maximum order limitation for a single task order issued under the contract will be $5 million.  There will be no dollar limit per year.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping performance periods.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.
  The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Estimated contract start date is October 2013.  The proposed contract is a total small business set-aside; therefore, replies to this notice are requested only from small business concerns.  The applicable NAICS is 541620 with a small business size standard of $14.0 million in average annual gross receipts for the preceding three fiscal years.

Brooks Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures will apply.

  The most credit will be given for relevant specialized experience in California, followed by relevant specialized experience in Nevada and Arizona.  Less credit will be given for specialized experience in other locations in the United States.

Submission Requirements:  Provide a maximum of ten (10) completed or substantially completed projects in Section F of the SF330 that best illustrate relevant specialized experience.  Select NEPA projects that demonstrate the teamâ€™s capability to perform work similar to that required for this contract.  For each project provided, indicate which team members participated in the preparation of the NEPA environmental documents or related tasks, each firmâ€™s role, and an estimate of the percentage of work that was performed by each firm.

CRITERION 2: PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.
  Professional qualifications of the key personnel proposed for this contract, including prime, joint venture, and subcontractor key staff to be assigned to the project.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of the staffâ€™s professional qualifications and relevant experience necessary for performance of the required services, and the depth of proposed staff to ensure continuity of services and ability to meet unexpected project demands.  Firms must demonstrate a minimum of four (4) NEPA Project Managers on staff with direct experience managing multiple large and complex EA and EIS projects, not just sections of the documents.

Submission Requirements:  Provide a brief but complete resume as instructed in Section E of the SF330 for each proposed key person who will participate significantly in the work required for this contract.
  Each resume shall include a maximum of five (5) projects that were completed or substantially completed in the period from October 2007 to October 2012, that best illustrate the individualâ€™s experience relevant to the requirements of this contract.  For biologists, identify the threatened or endangered species for which the individual possesses U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service survey permits, and describe experience surveying plant and animal species in California, Nevada, and Arizona.  Provide resumes only for those key personnel who will actually perform work under the proposed contract.  Complete Section G of the SF330 as instructed to indicate key personnel participation in the example projects from Section F.
  Key personnel identified under this criterion should also be shown with their roles on the Organizational Chart provided under Section D of the SF330.

CRITERION 3: CAPACITY.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Firms will be evaluated based on projected workload and staffing, and ability to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Firms must demonstrate capacity to work on multiple simultaneous Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Assessment projects primarily in California, Nevada, and Arizona.

Submission Requirements (Section H of the SF330):  Indicate the firmâ€™s present and projected workload (including project type, dollar amount, and complexity), staffing plan (including location of staff), and the availability of the proposed team for the specified contract performance period.
  Include information concerning the firmâ€™s ability to obtain security clearance(s) for its key personnel.  Provide any additional information pertinent to the firmâ€™s capacity to meet the FAR 52.219-14 requirement that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  

CRITERION 4: PAST PERFORMANCE.  Past performance on relevant contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F of the SF330.  Firms will be evaluated based on past performance assessments and other available information regarding past performance.

Submission Requirements (Section H of the SF330):  For each project provided as experience in Section F of the SF330, list applicable awards, commendations, and any other performance evaluations, including negative evaluations (do not submit copies).
  Provide information about problems encountered during performance and corrective actions taken.  For each of these projects, also provide a client point of contact, and his/her current telephone number and email address.  All other awards, commendations, and performance evaluations received within the last six years (October 2006 to October 2012) should be listed separately by referencing the issuing agency or company, the date of issuance, and a point of contact with his/her current telephone number and email address.  If received for a federal government contract, state the evaluation type and rating.  If not for a federal contract, provide relevant similar evaluation information.

CRITERION 5: QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM.
   Firms will be evaluated on the validity and strength of their described internal quality control methods and demonstrated knowledge of applicable regulatory requirements related to quality control.

Submission Requirements (Section H of the SF330):  Describe your corporate quality control program, processes and procedures, and assigned authorities.  Submittal of a broad or generic quality control manual is not acceptable.  Provide a description of the specific steps the project team will use for each of the tasks under this contract that relate to management of workload, coordination between team members, assignment of tasks to appropriate personnel, use of appropriate technical methodology, technical and regulatory accuracy, consistency between resource topics in a single document, technical editing by a professional technical editor, word processing by a professional word processor, reviews to ensure revisions per government comments on draft documents are made accurately, correct grammar and spelling, readability of documents, understandability of the NEPA documents to the public reader (compliance with the Plain Writing Act of 2010), and document production scheduling and delivery.
  In addition to technical document preparation, discuss how the project team proposes to provide quality service in terms of understanding government client objectives, following government-provided document formats and templates, providing timely responses to government requests, and reducing government time and effort required to manage the contract.  Illustrate successes in ensuring quality and identify any commendations or evaluations received regarding quality control.  Of special interest are the quality control processes in place that minimize the governmentâ€™s need to perform quality assurance reviews of the A-Eâ€™s work product for errors, omissions, and quality. 

CRITERION 6: LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY.
  Location in the general geographic area of the contract and knowledge of the locality and its natural resources and environmental issues will be evaluated.  Knowledge of the locality is particularly important as it relates to the firmâ€™s biologistsâ€™ abilities to survey local plants and animals in the field.  Also, knowledge of the needs and requirements of state and local federal regulatory agenciesâ€™ consultations and permit requirements is important.  The most credit will be given for location in and knowledge of California, where the majority of performance is expected, followed by location in and knowledge of Nevada and Arizona.  Less credit will be given for other locations in the United States.
  This criterion will be applied only if it leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract.

Submission Requirements (Section H of the SF330):  Provide any additional information regarding location and knowledge of the locality that has not already been provided in another section of the SF 330.

CRITERION 7: VOLUME OF WORK AWARDED.  Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DoD) within the past 12 months.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DoD with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of contracts among qualified A-E firms as appropriate.

Submission Requirements:  None.
  The government has this data, so no additional information is required.

Personal interviews may be scheduled for firms slated as most highly qualified.  Firms slated for interviews may be asked to explain or expand on information contained in the SF 330 submittal.  Elaborate presentations are not desired.

All information must be included in the SF 330 package.  Cover letters, attachments other than the Section D Organizational Chart, and excess numbers of pages will be excluded from the evaluation process.  All contractors are advised that registration in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the DoD CCR database may render your firm ineligible for award.
  Firms must also complete the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  For more information, check the website at https://www.sam.gov.  In accordance with the Brooks Act, the A-E firm must be a registered/licensed architectural and/or engineering firm and will be required to submit proof of this status prior to the interview phase of the selection process.  In states where a firm is not required to be registered under state law, the name of the registered architect or engineer with their state registration number and business license is acceptable.  The A-E firm must be permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering in one or more states within the geographic region covered by the proposed contract.
 

A-E firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement and wish to be considered must submit their completed SF 330 package (original plus 3 electronic copies on separate CDs) marked with the solicitation number to:  Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, 1220 Pacific Highway, Attn:  Carol Hart, Code AQE.CH, Bldg 127, Room 108, San Diego, CA 92132-5190 no later than 2:00 PM local time on 29 November 2012.

<CONTACT>Andrew Jacobs, Contract Specialist, Phone 5106375974, Email Andrew.G.Jacobs@uscg.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard's 140 foot WTGB Ice Breaking Tug class cutters are in need of a service life extension. In order to begin this anticipated extensive maintenance project numerous items/systems are required.
<p>This presolicitation notice concerns the requirement for the boat davit system (boat davit &amp; supporting equipment) for each of the cutters/ships; there are a total of 9 ships which will need this boat davit system. The vendor shall provide all labor and material to provide the boat davit and support equipment and the U.S. Coast Guard will accomplish the installation.</p>
<p>Although the Coast Guard is accomplishing installation of the boat davit system, the vendor will be required to supply on-site technical support at the installation activity to ensure the equipment is installed correctly for start-up, commissioning, and operator training.</p>
<p>Hardware and component items (for each ship) covered by this procurement are as follows:</p>
<p>One (1) single-point lift, A-frame type, davit and supporting foundation. The davit shall be able to launch and retrieve from the water a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) 20 foot in length with a 9 foot beam. The davit shall operate and be certified with a Working Load Limit (WLL) of 4000 pounds. The Working Load Limit includes the weight of the boat, sling, fuel, outfit, and crew.</p>
<p>One (1) hydraulic power unit mounted to the davit supporting foundation.</p>
<p>One (1) control system to operate the davit system and one (1) motor starter panel to start the HPU pump motor.</p>
<p>Engineering and technical support items to be provided by the Vendor specifically covered by this procurement are as follows:</p>
<p>The Vendor shall supply certified technical manuals and drawings describing the davit, hydraulic power unit, control system, and motor controller to provide the United States Coast Guard with sufficient information to produce Cutter specific installation drawings.</p>
<p>The Vendor shall supply sufficient information on the system and components to allow the Coast Guard to produce maintenance procedure cards (MPCs) and other logistical support documentation.</p>
<p>The Vendor shall provide on-site technical support for training, system testing, commissioning, and certification.</p>
<p>The Vendor shall provide maintenance parts lists and a recommended onboard repair parts (OBRP) list for all components.</p>
<p>Any materials and components sub-contracted for shall be the responsibility of the Vendor. The boat davit system shall be provided as a skid mounted, factory assembled and tested system. <br />The drawings listed in paragraph 2.3.2 of the draft specification provide guidance into the potential location for the hull inflatable boat (RHIB), the installation location for the davit and the existing handing system. The Government will be responsible for installing the new davit system on the boats. The draft specification is attached.</p>
<p>This procurement will be accomplished through unrestricted full and open competition with award being made to the responsible offeror whose proposal contains the combination of technical capablility, past performance, &amp; price offering the best overall value to the Government. The applicable NAICS code is 333923.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract vehicle will be a requirements contract with a base year and 4 option years all containing firm fixed unit prices. 1 boat davit system will be awarded in the base contract year. The remaining 8 boat davit systems will be awarded within the following 4 option years when funding becomes available. Although the remaining 8 boat davit systems are called for in option years, all of these remaining 8 boat davit systems are considered essential and a definite Coast Guard need, however funding will not be available until the option year periods. The delivery date for the base year's first boat davit system is anticipated to be within the month of March 2014.</p>
<p>Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and must have an active and complete registration status prior to award, during performance, and through final payments of any contract and/or order resulting from the solicitation. Contractors may obtain information on registration via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>It is anticipated the request for proposal will be available starting October 4th to 12th 2012. Interested parties are hereby notified that this solicitation will be available exclusively on the FedBiz Opps website at www.fbo.gov. The RFP and any attachments and amendments will be published for viewing and printing from the FedBizOpps website. Interested parties will be responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for this information. No paper copies of the solicitation or any attachments or amendments will be distributed.</p>

<DESC>United States Marine Corps effort for systems capability upgrades to Live training Gaps within the Squad Immersive Training Environment (SITE). The Live training toolkit baseline system is Instrumented Tactical Engagement Simulation System II (I-TESS II). The capability enhancements are not currently available within the I-TESS II toolkit. This effort includes all Program Management, Engineering, Testing, and Logistics tasks associated with developing the capability upgrades. In addition to the development of the system capabilities a verification of the training systems to meet the SITE capability gaps will be conducted upon completion of development. The system upgrades will conform to the Instrumented- Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (I-MILES) specification and ensure compliance with the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA is the foundational architecture for the Live Training Transformation Family of Training Systems (LT2-FTS) strategy. CTIA consists of standard architecture services, components and protocols, and it facilitates commonality across the various training instrumentation systems and interoperability across Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) and joint training environments. The Government seeks suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements.
<p>The SITE specific capability enhancements are as follow:<br />1. Mortars - Integrate mortar firing capability, paring sensors, ballistic computer, and forward observer device (M224, 60mm and M252, 81mm) into baseline system.<br />2. Assault-Squads - Integrated MK153 shoulder launched multipurpose assault weapon (SMAW) simulator capability, paring sensors, day/night sighting, and back blast mechanism (non-pyrotechnic) into baseline system.<br />3. Anti-Armor - Integrated M220 TOW and M98A1 Javelin simulator capabilities and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />4. Machine Guns - Integrated MK 19 Instrumented Weapon System (IWS) simulator, Small Arms Transmitter (SAT) and paring sensors into baseline system.<br />5. Close Air Support - Provide a Forward Observer capability to effectively simulate call for fire and provide visual cues to the effect of the munitions. The effect will illustrate persistent CAS weapons impacts. The capability will include audio recordings at the tactical radio for use in the AAR into the baseline system.<br />6. Sniper Marksmanship - Integrated M107 long range sniper rifle (LRSR) and M110 semi-automatic sniper system (SASS)- SAT Sniper rifle capability, paring sensors and the Forward Observers use of existing Fire Control Devices while minimizing laser safety issues into baseline the system.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT COMMIT THE CONTRACTOR OR THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY WAY OR AT ANY TIME INTO ENTERING A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) on behalf of the Project Management Office of the General Fund Enterprise Business System under U.S. Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS) is publishing information for the Army Procurement EXecution (APEX) program, formerly referred to as the Army Contract Writing &amp; Management System (ACWMS). The purpose of this Sources Sought announcement is to notify interested parties of information available on the emerging APEX program.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />Currently, the Army utilizes two contract writing systems to support operational and institutional requirements. The systems, Procurement Automated Data and Document System/Virtual Contracting Enterprise (PADDS/VCE) and Standard Procurement Systems (SPS) support approximately 8000 users at 273 different locations. On 21 October 2011 the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP) issued direction on the sunset (termination) for use of DoD Standard Procurement Systems (SPS). At that time, the services were directed to program, budget for and execute plans to support future contracting capabilities to replace SPS.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the Army Contracting Command (ACC) published a Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information and, as a result of the input received; Contractors who met the screening criteria described in the RFI were invited to a series of industry events. Industry events served as a forum for information gathering and market research that allowed the Government to identify existing industry capabilities. Contractors were invited to respond with a 2-hour live system and product functionality demonstration and briefing. Additionally, Contractors were to validate their system capabilities according to a series of Government-provided high-level requirements statements. Subsequent to the demonstrations and self-certification, the Government conducted a hands-on exercise of a variety of systems according to Government-established scenario based use cases and requested additional information on the technical capabilities of the proposed solution(s). Included with this notice are the documents that were published and used during these events. In summary they are:</p>
<p>1. March 2012 Sources Sought Notice/Request for Information W9124P12RFI99<br />2. Technical Capabilities Questionnaire<br />3. Vendor System Validation Worksheet<br />Government Established Use-Cases:<br />4. Management Use Case v1.1<br />5. Functional Use Case v1.3<br />6. Functional Use Case Expeditionary Contracting v1.4<br />7. Functional Use Case System Administration v1.2<br />8. Functional Use Case Weapons System v1.4</p>
<p>As a result of these events, the Government completed an analysis of alternatives; provided a summary and recommendation for an acquisition strategy to fulfill the APEX requirement. To date, no decision has been made.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS<br />As delineated, the purpose of this notice is to notify interested parties of the above reference d information. A RESPONSE IS NOT REQUIRED.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the information included in this publication may be submitted for Government consideration. Any questions submitted may be publicized. Any questions, information or ideas submitted to the Government may be used in formulating its acquisition strategy or technical approach, therefore permission to use the information for these purposes is inherently granted with the submission.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 7 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.
The U.S. Geological Survey, Missouri Water Science Center-Kansas City Office has entered into a Cooperative Water Science Agreement with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources to examine the effects of conservation practice implementation on water quality in the Lower Grand River Basin over the period 2011-2014. As part of this agreement, the USGS will be collecting periphyton samples for determination of biomass and community structure.
The Phycology Section of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research at The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, PA (PERC) is the only laboratory in the United States to have developed a systematic laboratory approach for periphyton analyses in order to meet USGS criteria for the Ecological National Synthesis Project of the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program.  Such an approach is necessary in order to maintain data comparability between the proposed work and the historical work conducted by NAWQA. Without this approach, one of the principal goals of the project (comparison to previous studies), cannot be met. Additionally, because these samples will be collected over a 3-year period, analytical procedures must be consistent to maintain data comparability within the project.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from PERC, and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business November 5, 2012 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 7 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, WRD, Kansas District, has a requirement to provide data for methods developed on an ultra sensitive Applied Biosystems API 5500 triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (TQMS) system. The U.S. Geological Survey, Kansas Water Science Centers (WSC) Organic Geochemistry Research Laboratory (OGRL), requests award of a non-competitive procurement to AB Sciex for a multiyear agreement to service an API 5500 Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (TQMS) for a base performance period of 23 Sept. 2011 to December 31, 2011, and three option years. The Government intends to seek other sources before exercising the option on this existing order.
For OGRL to fulfill its project obligations the API 5500 TQMS system needs operate continuously.  Thus, proper maintenance and prompt repair is critical for the OGRL to fulfill its mission and obligations to its collaborators. Currently the API 5500 TQMS is covered under a one-year warranty for labor, parts, and two preventive maintenance visits under a one-year warranty service. 
Because the API 5500 TQMS is a relatively new model, ultrasensitive state-of-the-art mass spectrometer with a new design, it is imperative 1) that the instrument be serviced by factory certified engineers with at least four years of experience on the API product line of mass spectrometers and also experience in servicing the API 5500 and API 5500 Q-Trap series mass spectrometers, 2) that access to manufacturer parts is guaranteed, and 3) that the service provider be tied to the instrument manufacturer because new model instruments can have unique issues that cannot be remedied by third party vendors. In addition, researchers at OGRL recently found that the liquid chromatographs (LC) were contaminating its mass spectrometers. Because the API 5500 TQMS system has a bioinert LC on the front end it is currently the only LC/TQMS systems at OGRL that is functioning. Thus, if the API 5500 if the instrument is not properly maintained, or parts cannot be obtained or obtained in a timely manner, or a design problem manifests itself and there is no manufacturer support OGRL will be unable to meet its project obligations, which are substantial and critical to several USGS, other federal agency and other external agency programs. 

Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from AB Sciex and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office 9 (NCO 9) intends to award a sole source contract award to Verizon Wireless, 13100 Columbia Pike, Silver Spring MD. 20904. The Period of Performance for Contract Award will be one (1) twelve (12) month period.

This requirement is for wireless voice and data services and associated devices from Verizon Wireless to replace services currently rendered to Veterans Affairs CBOC Master Account 000975488496.  In addition to voice and data services, other wireless non-voice and data related services are subject to annual renewal.  These services are Global International Roaming, Text/PIX/FLIX Messaging, Tethering, Wireless Priority Service (WPS), and GPS Navigation.

The devices, which include cellular telephones, push-to-talk cellular devices, smart phones (Blackberry, iPhones, Androids), and mobile broadband devices (Cards, MiFi, Cameras, Tablets, iPads), are not available via the contractor's FSS contract and, therefore, will be incorporated as open market items in accordance with FAR 8.402(f).

Due to issues relating to device/network interoperability, device activation, and device pricing, Verizon Wireless is the only vendor capable of providing a comprehensive solution, including access to Verizon Wireless voice and data services, compatible mobile devices, and activation for mobile devices. 

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date and time. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award. Responses are due by October 31, 2012, 12:00 p.m. (EDT). Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to dustin.epperson@va.gov.

<CONTACT>Mark Surina, Email USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil
<DESC><p>FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES POSTING<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p>World-wide Asset Visibility and Tracking Capability for Cargo Containers, Using Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) and/or Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Techniques</p>
<p>Number: <br />USTCTT0113</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking non-federal partners ("Collaborators") in industry or academia for consideration to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) (described in 15 USC 3710a) to:</p>
<p>- Collaboratively explore best practices in container tracking using ALPR/OCR systems and techniques, to develop Concepts of Operation (CONOPS), understanding of integration requirements, economic factors (procurement, lifecycle costs, and predicted return on investment), system considerations (training, security, maintenance procedures, etc.). A list and brief discussion of USTRANSCOM areas of interest are included below in this RFI.</p>
<p>- Potentially conduct field trials of the pertinent ALPR/OCR hardware, software, supporting communications and information architectures, security measures, and user interfaces to assess utility in addressing the inefficiencies (e.g., lack of visibility) leading to unnecessary DOD expense in managing containers.</p>
<p>The products of the collaborative research will be paper studies and/or field trials on ALPR/OCR-enabled container tracking, feasibility, maturity for use in USTRANSCOM, proposed CONOPS, costs, and risks.</p>
<p>Small businesses may respond to this announcement. Potential Collaborators may team with other qualified non-federal parties. Tracking system providers, as well as commercial logistics providers (including entities which track items outside of DOD or to support DOD) such as shipping companies, fourth- or third-party logistics providers, etc.), or academic organizations may team or respond independently.</p>
<p>Working definitions are:</p>
<p>Container - Joint Publication 1-02 definitions a container as: "An article of transport equipment that meets American National Standards Institute/ International Organization for Standardization standards that is designed to be transported by various modes of transportation. These containers are also designed to facilitate and optimize the carriage of goods by one or more modes of transportation without intermediate handling of the contents and equipped with features permitting ready handling and transfer from one mode to another. Containers may be fully enclosed with one or more doors, open top, refrigerated, tank, open rack, gondola, flatrack, and other designs." <br />Further, MIL HDBK 138B defines a container as "any commercially owned or military owned intermodal container meeting the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and certified under the provisions of the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC)".<br />Tracking - Capability to identify specific containers and their current geographic location with a high degree of detail, accuracy, and reliability<br />Tracking System - The full complement of hardware, software, decision support tools, applications, user interfaces, procedures, training capabilities, maintenance systems, data capture, storage and transmission, personnel, and other elements of a capability to track items worldwide.<br />Visibility - Availability of accurate and timely information about selected container location and/or status at all specified management levels and locations.<br /><br />Areas of investigation under the CRADA may include the following list of system features. Responses to this RFI do not need to address all listed features, and it may not be practical to explore all areas during a CRADA; actual development/demonstration goals will be determined during discussions prior to CRADA signature and during the life of the CRADA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Features of greatest interest:<br /><br />- Theoretical reliability and expected reliability/accuracy in use<br />Has the system been used in a realistic environment and what are the reliability and accuracy in that environment? What practices in operation increase reliability and accuracy? What conditions impede reliability and accuracy including dust, fog, damaged or obscured number plates? What are the limitations imposed by the image capture system's field of view/offset angle? Does the system operate effectively at night? What velocity between the reader and the number plate can be accommodated? What is the reliability and accuracy in stacked container environments?</p>
<p>- Equipment portability/size/weight; ease of deployability and associated manpower/time requirements<br />Is the system easy to move/set up by a small unit or a few personnel; is there need for Material Handling Equipment (MHE)? The manpower/time requirements refer to the length of time required to set up the equipment for operation or to break it down for transport. What are the requirements to set up the system? Will training be necessary? Are there circumstances precluding DOD personnel from the set up or break down of the equipment?</p>
<p>- Usability in fixed, semi-fixed, or portable applications, in garrison or at forward operating locations or in austere conditions<br />Can the system be used in a semi-permanent basis in garrison or transported for temporary use in forward operating bases or in austere environments, for example, in support of humanitarian missions, such as earthquake relief?</p>
<p>- Cost/affordability/lifecycle cost (cost for equipment, installation, maintenance and expected sustained costs for use during the system's life cycle) if purchased or if leased, in various quantities<br />What are the costs to include all equipment needed to operate, set up, and sustain the tracking capability? Describe expected costs for the DOD to own versus lease the system.</p>
<p>- Information security/information assurance features, including encryption capability<br />Can the data capture techniques exclude additional information or imagery which may be operationally sensitive? For example, is there a way that the system will read and capture only the container number without other surroundings?</p>
<p>Other features of interest:</p>
<p>- Company's experience with ALPR/OCR or other tracking capability as applied to a realistic/actual user environment; agencies using the company's products<br />This information may be presented from the perspective of manufacturers/vendors of ALPR/OCR technology or by agencies who have actually used this technology.</p>
<p>- Accuracy vs. rate of data acquisition tradeoffs<br />Is there a point at which more rapid acquisition of data degrades accuracy or reliability?</p>
<p>- Compatibility with other tracking or tagging techniques<br />How is data transmitted and used outside the ALPR/OCR system? Are there limits in what formats the data can be captured, stored, and read? Will DOD information/tracking systems require changes to use the information?</p>
<p>- Automation capability or person-in-the-loop requirements<br />How efficient is the system in operation in terms of manpower requirements? What personnel numbers and skill levels are required to operate the system and use the information?</p>
<p>- Recommended methods or stimuli required to trigger the data acquisition procedure and alternate triggers<br />Does the technology recognize, capture and store just the container number, or will the image capture system detect and capture every object moving in front of it?</p>
<p>- Data error-checking methods<br />Is manpower required to check errors? Does the system reject erroneous data or automatically perform error-checking?</p>
<p>- Tamper-resistance features<br />What features resist tampering, theft of hardware and theft of data?<br /><br />- Operating cycle time imposed by power supply or other features<br />How long will the system operate? Will it require a battery? Can it be solar-powered or use other power sources?</p>
<p>- Training and maintenance concepts<br />Who will maintain the OCR unit? Need it be contracted out or would the government be responsible? How much maintenance will be needed? How do operators and maintainers obtain skills? How much training is required?</p>
<p>- Information architecture/communications protocols<br />Can the data capture, storage and transmission meet DOD information security requirements? How will the data be sent? Will a text file be sent? Will a picture of the container be included? Will it be possible to steal sensitive data by stealing the image capture system or other components?</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM or any other government agency in this area.</p>
<p>Multiple federal agencies may participate on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM, including Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (MSDDC, US Army), other Federal Laboratories, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, as the U.S. Government deems appropriate.</p>
<p>Supporting information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities should remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level. If classified information exchange is proposed by the Collaborator, Collaborator personnel must be appropriately cleared at the outset of the CRADA at no cost to the government.</p>
<p>Outputs of the collaboration will be shared information on the concept of operations, characteristics, economics, experiences in field trials, and feasibility of cargo tracking methods as applied to the Department of Defense supply chain.</p>
<p>CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, provides personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources with or without reimbursement (but not funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property, or other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."</p>
<p>CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a 1-year period, although duration can be tailored to suit the parties' needs before or even after work begins, by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>USTRANSCOM and other designated government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow). Based on Collaborator experience/capability to innovate in this area, technical qualifications of Collaborator and assigned personnel, past experience in tracking concept development and engineering, experience in developing tracking concepts of operation and support, economic analysis capability, and Government interest and capacity to enter into such agreements, USTRANSCOM will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers and so notify the respondents.</p>
<p>Initial selection of white papers and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.</p>
<p>After initial selection, discussions will ensue separately with each Government-selected Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement between USTRANSCOM and the Collaborator(s) on objectives, duration, intellectual property, and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA(s). The government may choose to visit pertinent facilities for a tour of Collaborator capabilities prior to final selection. The government may choose to hold an industry day near Scott AFB, Illinois for down-selected providers of white papers.</p>
<p>No funding is available from the government to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits or any other Collaborator costs of preparation or participation in a CRADA.</p>
<p>The USTRANSCOM template CRADA is available for download at http://www.transcom.mil/tccs/ORTA.cfm so potential Collaborators may understand its terms. The Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will draft and seek to finalize specific CRADA objectives and language collaboratively via discussions/mutual agreement after government white paper selection.</p>
<p>Interested parties may respond with white papers not later than NLT 28 Nov 2012 0000 (12:00 midnight Central time) by unclassified e-mail to USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil by submitting an UNCLASSIFIED written white paper in following format. Hardcopy submittal is not allowed.</p>
<p>Submittals not following this format will not be considered:</p>
<p>- Microsoft Word or .pdf format of not more than 8 pages in length, on standard 8&frac12; by 11-inch page, with 1-inch margins at top, bottom, left and right, in Times New Roman font of not less than 12-point size, with not more than 6 lines per inch. <br />- Pages numbered sequentially in the bottom footer including company name and identification of proprietary information as appropriate on each page. <br />- Clearly marked/identified proprietary information, photos, or diagrams. <br />- Include the following information (within the 8-page limit): <br />-- Title (no separate title page needed; use space for useful white paper information).<br />-- Company name and state of incorporation, and incorporation of any parent entity. Companies with foreign ownership or parentage must identify the nation of incorporation of the non-U.S. entity. <br />-- How your company meets USTRANSCOM's interests and could contribute to the formation of a CRADA partnership in this area: capability to innovate, ability to analyze user needs, develop advanced tracking concepts, understand and design the entire system of tracking, not just the tracking hardware itself; work to mitigate risks of development, production, or operations; simulate, model, author reports, host meetings and exercises, perform economic analysis, and otherwise apply resources and expertise pertinent to collaborative development of tracking concepts and systems.<br />-- Capability to address and by collaborative research explore the "areas of investigation" listed above and other system characteristics determined to be of interest.<br />-- Resources to be supplied by the Collaborator (facilities, overall personnel expertise, information systems, proprietary materials, prototypes, etc.).<br />-- Describe any open source software and any third party software to be provided by the Collaborator. <br />-- Resources requested from USTRANSCOM (personnel skillsets, data, test/demo facilities, etc.; no DOD-provided funding is permitted).<br />-- Background/experience in tracking system development, engineering, integration with existing systems and infrastructures, economic and other analysis, test, and operation, (with DOD points of contact and address/phone numbers as references, if available).<br />-- Points of contact (name, point of contact, address, e-mail, and phone) for notification of selection/non-selection and follow-on discussions/visits (if chosen). <br />USTRANSCOM and other government entities participating in white paper review and actual collaborative work under CRADAs may include in-house support contractors and members of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). Non-disclosure agreements will be signed as required by the Parties to incorporate these participants. <br />Proposals not selected for further discussion will be archived by the government and appropriately protected.<br />The USTRANSCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) manager (coordinator of USTRANSCOM Technology Transfer activities) is a member of the MITRE Corporation, an FFRDC. <br />Primary Point of Contact: Mr. Mark Surina, MITRE Corporation, Manager, USTRANSCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications, USTRANSCOM TCCS-ORTA, 508 Scott Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5357, e-mail: USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil.</p>

United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking non-federal partners ("Collaborators") from industry and academia for consideration to enter into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) (described in 15 USC 3710a) to:</p>
<p>- Collaboratively explore best practices and various approaches (technical, doctrinal, procedural, etc.) to worldwide PMI equipment tracking</p>
<p>- Develop concepts of operations (CONOPS)</p>
<p>- Examine systems and data integration into existing AMC information programs of record (POR);</p>
<p>- Evaluate economic factors (e.g., procurement, lifecycle costs, predicted return on investment, payback period, etc.)</p>
<p>- Consider attendant issues such as training, security, reliability, etc.</p>
<p>- Potentially conduct field trials of techniques and systems</p>
<p>Working definitions are:</p>
<p>Patient Movement Items (PMI) - Medical supplies and equipment (electrical and mechanical) supporting enroute continuum of care missions which can be used in/on multi-modal platforms (rotary and fixed wing aircraft, ships, rail, and automobile, etc). Examples: Stacking Litter System, Wound Vacuum Devices, Defibrillator, Ventilator, Monitor, Pulse Oximeter.</p>
<p>Tracking - Real-time knowledge of PMI location including visual display of geographic location and important data elements (e.g. equipment type, serial number, latest inspection date, location history, battery life status/charge remaining) with enough accuracy, reliability, etc., to manage continuous global equipment recycling to support patient movement/care.</p>
<p>Tracking System -the full complement of hardware, software, decision support tools, applications, user interfaces, procedures, training capabilities, maintenance systems, data, personnel, integration capabilities, and other elements of a capability to track items worldwide for the above stated purposes.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM or any other Government agency in this area.</p>
<p>Small and large businesses and universities may respond to this announcement. Respondents (potential Collaborators) may team with other qualified non-federal parties. Commercial logistics providers, such as shippers, systems/equipment managers, and third/fourth-party logistics firms, may also team or respond independently.</p>
<p>Multiple federal agencies may participate in this collaborative project on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM, including AMC, other federal laboratories, and other agencies as the U.S. Government deems appropriate.</p>
<p>Information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities are proposed to remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level. If classified information exchange is indicated, Collaborator personnel must provide, at no cost to the Government, clearance documentation prior to classified data/information exchange.</p>
<p>Results and products of this collaborative effort may be reports, presentations, simulations, field trials, and analyses of feasibility, technical maturity, costs, risks, etc., as well as (but not limited to) doctrine, training, CONOPS, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) information.</p>
<p>CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property and other resources with or without reimbursement (excluding funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties may provide personnel, services, facilities, equipment, data, information, intellectual property, funds, and other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."</p>
<p>CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a 1-year period, although duration can be tailored to suit both parties' needs, by mutual agreement, before or after work begins.</p>
<p>USTRANSCOM and other Government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow), based on Collaborator demonstrated applicable experience, technical qualifications, resources offered, etc. Government resources available for collaboration will also be considered. USTRANSCOM will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers and so notify respondents.</p>
<p>Initial white paper selection and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.</p>
<p>After initial Government white paper selection, discussions will ensue separately with each potential Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement between USTRANSCOM and the Collaborator(s) on objectives, duration, intellectual property, and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA(s). The Government may choose to visit applicable facilities to observe Collaborator capabilities prior to final selection. The Government may choose to hold an Industry Day or similar activity, at or near Scott AFB, Illinois either before or after initial white paper selection.</p>
<p>No Government funding is available to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits, or any other Collaborator costs of preparation or participation in a CRADA.</p>
<p>The USTRANSCOM CRADA template is available for download at http://www.ustranscom.mil/about/org/tccs/Model_USTRANSCOM_CRADA.pdf for potential Collaborator familiarization. Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will cooperatively draft and finalize specific CRADA scope, objectives, commitments, and language through discussions/and mutual agreement after Collaborator selection.</p>
<p>Interested parties must submit white papers not later than 28 Nov 2012 2359 hrs via e-mail to USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil in following format. Hardcopy submittals will not be considered. White papers submitted to other than the above e-mail address will not be considered.</p>
<p>Submittals not adhering to the following prescribed format will not be considered.</p>
<p>- Microsoft Word or .pdf format of not more than 8 pages in length, on standard 8&frac12; by 11-inch page, with 1-inch margins at top, bottom, left and right, in Times New Roman font of not less than 12-point size, with not more than 6 lines per inch. <br />- Pages numbered sequentially in the bottom footer including company/university/organization name on each page. <br />- Clearly marked/identified Proprietary Information; photos, diagrams, etc.<br />- Include the following information (within the 8-page limit): <br />-- Title (no separate title page needed)<br />-- Company name and state of incorporation, plus incorporation of any parent entity.

An optional brief video overview of facilities/capabilities (approx. 5 megabytes or less), in addition to the 8-page textual white paper, is acceptable.<br />-- Discussion of how potential Collaborator meets USTRANSCOM's stated interests and will contribute to a CRADA partnership in the subject area. Description of innovation capability, ability to analyze and understand user needs, develop advanced concepts, design systems compatible with existing Government systems, mitigate risks of development, production, integration, etc., model, simulate, produce reports, host meetings, exercises, or experiments, perform economic analyses, and otherwise apply resources and expertise to collaborative development of pertinent concepts and systems.<br />-- Resources to be supplied by the Collaborator (facilities, overall personnel expertise, information systems, proprietary materials, prototypes, etc.).<br />-- Open source software and any third party software to be provided by the Collaborator. <br />-- Resources requested from USTRANSCOM (personnel, skill sets, data, information, facilities, access, etc.)<br />-- Background/experience in applicable/related system development, engineering, integration with existing systems and infrastructures, economic and other analysis, testing, operation, etc. Provide DOD points of contact with addresses/phone numbers as references, if available.<br />-- Collaborator(s) points of contact (name, address, e-mail, and phone) for notification of selection/non-selection and follow-on actions (if chosen). <br />USTRANSCOM and other Government agency personnel participating in white paper review and follow-on collaborative work under CRADA may include in-house support contractors and members of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC). Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) will be accomplished wherever needed to protect respondent intellectual property. The USTRANSCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA), which orchestrates all USTRANSCOM Technology Transfer activities, is managed by members of the MITRE Corporation's National Security Engineering Center FFRDC. White papers from respondents that do not become CRADA collaborators will be retained in TCCS-ORTA records and all clearly marked proprietary information will be protected.</p>

<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

POC: SFC DeLeon Kelly, (760) 380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Clarification for Attachment 1 Statement of Work: The word &ldquo;install&rdquo; refers to the point in which the generator has been delivered and cables have been pulled and handed over to the lessor. Once cables are passed to the lessor, &ldquo;install&rdquo; on vendor&rsquo;s part has been completed. The vendor shall assist the lessor with the running of cable for installation of the connection to the power source of the facility where applicable, as this may be needed at the MD NPSC. However, this type of installation is not part of the definition in our subject of purpose to &ldquo;deliver and install&rdquo; as this assistance may not be needed at both sites.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester shall file a formal agency protest to both the contracting officer and the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />Commandant, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />2100 2nd St SW Stop 7112<br />Washington, DC 20593-7112<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p><br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station intends to initiate a Request for Proposal (RFP) procurement action and award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Collection of Light Detection and Ranging Data (LiDAR) in the New Jersey Pinelands. The Contractor shall provide all equipment, labor, and materials necessary to map forest structure in open canopy pine and oak forests using LiDAR, ALS technology
<p>The acquisition will be solicited using the procurement process prescribed in Part 12, Commercial Items, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award prescribed in Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; and Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. A Firm-Fixed-Price contract will be awarded for a Base Period and two (2) Option Periods (if exercised) and will be from approximately November 2012 to April 2014. The Government will award the contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be the Best Value to the Government. The award may be made to a superior offeror which is not the lowest offered price, but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of a higher price. Proposals will be reviewed for completeness and evaluated for acceptability against the following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance: 1) Experience and Qualifications of Contractor Key Personnel [and Subcontractors, if applicable]; 2) Past Performance and 3) Price Reasonableness. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal weighting and are significantly more important than price; however price will contribute substantially to the selection decision. Award of the contract will be made as a whole to the offeror whose proposal conforms to all requirements of the specifications and is the "greatest value" to the Government, cost and other factors considered. The Government may elect to conduct discussions with offerors whose proposals are technically acceptable (or which may be expected to be made acceptable by moderate modification) and fall within the competitive price range. The Government reserves the right, however, to award a contract based on initial offers without conducting discussions. Therefore, each proposal should be submitted from the offeror's most favorable technical and price standpoints.</p>
<p>Solicitation documents, plans and specifications will only be available via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) homepage located at https://www.fbo.gov/ An electronic copy of Solicitation Number AG-3604-S-13-0002 will be posted on this site on or about October 16, 2012.

<RESPDATE>111612
<CONTACT>Chad M. Hepp, Phone 303-497-3443, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of four (4) Transmitter Control and Monitoring circuit cards and associated backplane in its 175 NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radars (WSR-88D). The NWS plans on developing and acquiring a new transmitter control and monitoring system. The current four card design is based on mid 1980's TTL technology. The current circuit cards and backplane are becoming obsolete. The NWS desires to develop a single circuit card and backplane using modern technology that can be installed in the current transmitter. The new card will be modular and will plug into the new backplane. The NWS requires the services of a reengineering and specification development organization. The organization must be capable of analyzing complex electronic function and designing circuits and systems capable of controlling a transmitter. The organization must be capable of prototype development, testing and fine tuning of a final design. Upon completion of a successful prototype, the organization must be capable of producing an acquisition specification. The specification would include all necessary drawings, bill-of-materials, design and manufacturing specifications and automated manufacturing data such as Gerber files that would support the government's procurement, of sufficient quantities of circuit cards and backplanes to support the radar fleet. Any procurement of productions quantities of this design would be done using a different contract vehicle. The government requires unlimited rights to the resulting design.
<p>A brief description of the logic and functionality of the existing cards is as follows: The Control and Monitoring circuit cards consist of the Control Adaptor, Control Logic, Control Interface, and Remote Monitoring Subsystem (RMS) Interface. Operation of the transmitter is controlled by the control and monitoring circuit cards. These circuits provide front panel metering for voltages and currents, fault monitoring status indications, transmitter status, and external interfacing with the main data processor. Timing triggers and remote control commands received by the main data processor are distributed in the transmitter by the control and monitoring circuit cards and associated backplane.</p>
<p>A brief description of the backplane is as follows: The Backplane is based on wire-wrap technology mounted to an aluminum support structure, approximately 18 x 14 inches in size. The 27 50-pin connectors used are obsolete and need to be upgraded to more common style connectors. The majority of signals are TTL with a few low current voltage lines. Additional information regarding the current design can be found at:&nbsp; <a href="http://webfiles.roc.noaa.gov/Transmitter_CC_Backplane/">http://webfiles.roc.noaa.gov/Transmitter_CC_Backplane/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A NEW LINK.<br /></strong><br />RESPONSES: Responses to this RFI must contain sufficient information to clearly demonstrate that the responding organization has sufficient experience and capability to modernize the current design as described, and document that design sufficiently to support manufacture. The information must include the history, level of complexity and customer points of contact for past similar contracts. The information must include a description of the responding organization's facility and personnel resources available with specific attention given to design analysis, circuit card design, and prototyping capabilities. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, request for proposal, or request for quote and there is no related solicitation posted. Accordingly, respondents will not be reimbursed for any expenses incurred in providing a response. Any questions regarding this RFI should be addressed in writing to the NWS Project Engineer, Mr. Glenn Secrest (<a href="mailto:glenn.s.secrest@noaa.gov">glenn.s.secrest@noaa.gov</a>) with a courtesy copy provided to Contracting Officer, Chad Hepp at <a href="mailto:Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov">Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov</a>.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) and PMW 770, the Undersea Integration Program Office, intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for continued development, maintenance, and sustainment of the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) Control and Management (C&M) software for submarine and other platforms.
The CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.
The technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.
Software code and specification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  The Government anticipates providing updated software code and documents periodically through the procurement process.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site entitled, "Bidder's Repository NDA" and provide the e- mail address and phone number for up to two users to Patricia Ponce-Feliu patricia.poncefeliu@navy.mil.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA-issued PKI certificate, contact Mike Philbrook for further instruction.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.
The Government anticipates issuing a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330- Engineering Services.
The estimated date for solicitation release is October 2012.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FebBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for a supply IDIQ requirement entitled: " Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags".<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: The US Army Corps of Engineers plans to purchase passive integrated transponder (PIT) (134 - 136 kHz) tags for the next three years for research purposes associated with the Northwestern Division's Anadromous Fish Evaluation Program (AFEP). A PIT tag is classified as a sonar reading tag under the Standard Industrial Code #3812 and is subject to radio frequency licensing. The PIT tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic device measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter for the large smolts and 8.5-9.0 mm long by 2.0-2.1 mm in diameter for the small smolts. The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes. As the tagged fish out-migration occurs, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at seven permanent juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.<br /><br />Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and uniquely coded passive integrated transponder tag designed for all detection devices on the Columbia River Basin. Each tag must satisfy the Corps's requirements (without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range), new design of the Corner Collector technology, or compromised reliability). National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a series of tests to evaluate how well new tag models would perform in the current network of interrogation systems. The type of test performed on the PIT tags are physical and electrical parameters (measurements, weight, resonant frequency, turn-on voltage), read ranges under different noise levels, maximum read speed under different noise levels, and impact of tag grouping on reading efficiencies (how close different groups of tags could be to each other without interfering with the transceiver's ability to detect the individual tags). Performance test are held in a controlled laboratory environment as well as under field conditions. PIT tags must have been tested by Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and approved by the PIT Tag Steering Committee which consists of members of various regional fisheries organizations.<br /><br />PIT tags cannot interfere with other manufacture products that are already in use. There can be no measureable effect on other manufacturer's products already used in the Columbia River Basin.<br /><br />The supplier must be able to produce and provide large quantities of PIT tags in a short time frame in order to meet delivery dates driven by the timing of out-migrating juvenile salmonids and research activities.<br /><br />Other Information: The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site (www.fbo.gov) when released. Solicitation is scheduled to be issued as an IDIQ contract. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. <br /><br />Conducting Business with the Government: In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov. By submission of a quote, a vendor acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation. No CD's or hard copies will be available. The Government is not responsible for any loss of interest, connectivity, or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website. <br /><br />Please indicate your interest by submitting a detailed statement of your firm's capabilities to supply the required items in a timely manner.<br /><br />
