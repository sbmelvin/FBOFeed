<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE DRAFT SOLICITATION AND SITE VISIT AND IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A PROPOSAL</strong>.
<p>This is a pre-solicitation/synopsis notice for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback concerning the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and Site Visit. Response to the request for questions is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a Final Solicitation is released. However, we highly encourage you to reply. The request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>This requirement is to provide a Performance-Based Remediation (PBR) approach for Site Closeout (SC) involving remedial action efforts at Joint Base (JB) Charleston in South Carolina. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the Period of Performance (POP) in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental construction and engineering activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the corresponding DRAFT Statement of Objective (SOO), dated 15 October 2014. The POP is estimated at 120 months from date of award if all options are exercised.</p>
<p><strong>Request for Questions</strong>: The Government anticipates a Final Solicitation to be released in early December 2014. This notification is provided to allow early review of DRAFT solicitation documentation for this requirement. <strong>Questions concerning the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) and attachments as well as any questions pertaining to the site visit are due by 11:00 AM CT on 3 November 2014. Submit all questions in a Microsoft Word compatible format. Questions that are not submitted by the deadline may not be answered. </strong>The Government intends to post answers to all questions on FedBizOpps. Draft RFP documentation will remain open on FedBizOpps until such time as a final RFP is released or the procurement is cancelled.</p>
<p>NOTE: If your firm elects to participate in the proposal process for this requirement and the projects are not funded, you shall not be entitled to submit any claim for bid and/or proposal costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract<br /><br />General Information<br />Document Type: PreSolicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: <br />Posted Date: TBD<br />Original Response Date: TBD<br />Current Response Date: TBD<br />Original Archive Date: Automatic, 15 days after response date<br />Current Archive Date: Automatic, on specified date<br />Classification Code: A - Research &amp; Development<br />Set Aside: N/A<br />NAICS Code: 541- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services/541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)
<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Threat Reduction Agency, ATTN: J4CRT, 8725 John J. Kingman, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6201<br />Description<br />The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate and award a Contract on a sole-source basis to the National Academy of Sciences, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001, for an effort entitled "TRACK II Nuclear Treaty Verification Technology Dialogues." The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.</p>
<p>The scope of this effort is to support a set of formal dialogues with the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Science Group, to include a maximum of 3 per year, to address complex and evolving science and technology (S&amp;T) challenges, to implement current and emerging applications and approaches, and to provide confidence building measures to assure reciprocal information gathering and implementation.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences is the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement. The NAS and the Soviet Academy of Sciences began cooperating on scientific matters of mutual interest in the late 1950s. CISAC began its security dialogue with the Soviet Academy in 1981, when prominent academy members in both countries who had access at the highest levels of their governments concluded that the lack of government-to-government communication on nuclear weapons issues served neither countries interests. From the Cold War to the present day with the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) as its partner, CISAC has helped to promote mutual understanding. CISAC stays in close contact with U.S. leadership on nuclear issues, explores issues at the frontiers of what the governments can do on an official basis, and develops opportunities for bilateral cooperation. CISAC seeks to transition those opportunities to official channels (e.g., NAS-RAS CISAC ideas for fissile material disposition, research reactor conversion, and other matters were briefed to the highest levels of the two governments and resulted in joint programs). The topics of the CISAC dialogue meetings in this project have been developed between the NAS and RAS groups with suggestions and consultations with their governments, and focus on key security questions on the path toward verifiable reductions of nuclear arms, a strengthened nuclear nonproliferation regime, and a better secured world nuclear enterprise to prevent nuclear terrorism.</p>
<p>As a result of its long history of engagement in scientist-to-scientist level exchanges with foreign governmental bodies on behalf of the United States government, the NAS is the only entity which is capable of assuring "audience acceptance" of the intended foreign interlocutors. Thus it is determined that NAS is the only available U.S. entity that can empanel foreign government scientists in bilateral dialogues without the formal diplomatic and other constraints relating to information sharing.</p>
<p>This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal request for quotation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract, on a sole-source basis, to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Indianapolis, IN for the production of Lot One of the Common Aircraft Armament Test Set (CAATS) and the Pure Air Generator (PAG) Adapter Set (PAS) to test and troubleshoot bomb racks, missile launchers, pylons and emerging weapons carriage devices across most aircraft weapons systems. The PAS interfaces with the CAATS to test the LAU-7 and LAU-127 Hi-Pressure Pure Air Generator (HiPPAG) Launchers. The CAATS, which includes the PAS, will replace the legacy A/E37T-35A Common Rack and Launcher Test Set (CRALTS) which has reliability and obsolescence issues as well as design limitations that impact its ability to support future weapons carriage requirements.<br /><br />SAIC will sustain all drawings, configuration management, logistics, release and control requirements, design, manufacturing, testing, and calibration throughout the first lot of production of the CAATS and PAS. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), SAIC possesses the required expertise to finalize the production drawing package to facilitate a competitive procurement for the follow-on production requirements. Concurrently producing the first lot, while accomplishing the physical configuration audit and drawing package completion, will allow the program to meet the fleet's fielding requirements for the CAATS and PAS test gear.<br /><br />The Government does not possess the rights to the drawings for the CAATS and PAS. SAIC is the OEM of the CAATS, and PAS,&nbsp;and has proprietary ownership of the drawings, therefore SAIC is the only firm with the knowledge of the technical requirements to manufacture the CAATS/PAS without a disruption in schedule or additional cost to the program.<br /><br />Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<SUBJECT>69--Hawaiian Island Database (HIDB) for the H-1 program
<SOLNBR>N6134015R2416
<CONTACT>Ebone Neal 407-380-4409
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of a Hawaiian Island Database (HIDB) for the H-1 program under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.    
This acquisition is to integrate a HIDB into the existing UH-1Y Flight Training Device (FTD) 2F196B S/N 3 located at Marine Corp Air Station (MCAS) Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii (K-Bay).  This approach ensures that the HIDB will be in the correct run-time format and configuration to integrate and operate with the existing FTDs systems.
  Additionally, this approach ensures HIDB features, functionality, and integration with the FTDs existing systems will meet H-1 aircrew flight training requirements and eliminates negative training and safety issues resulting from incorrect HIDB functionality and format.
In order for a suitable HIDB to be installed on the trainer if must be in the Vital 1100 run-time format for the visual system to properly display dynamic and moving models (rocket fire, ground personnel, own ship, etc.), aircraft, vehicles, cultural features, airports, landing zones, and weather patterns/effects that are all essential to training aircrew.   There currently exists only one known source for equipment and tools necessary for developing and installing visual databases in the Flight Safety International (FSI) propriety Vital 1100 series format.
  The Vital 1100 format and the database generation systems were developed exclusively by FSI to support its commercial and military aircraft business units.  The Government neither has possession nor rights to systems and resources capable of developing and installing a Vital 1100 HIDB in the 2F196B-3.  Furthermore, FSI is the lead integrator and installer of all databases into the 2F196B-3 visual system.  Since the FTD is a new procurement, no other source of technically trained and experienced individuals exists that could successfully install and integrate the new HIDB.  The lack of equipment and skill sets available from any other source prevents the Government from procuring and installing a HIDB into the FTD.
    
FAR Part 6.302-1(2) states that When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or, for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.  Since market research has yielded no evidence that an alternative source exists that is capable of effectively developing the HIDB in the correct run-time format and integrating it into the existing FTD systems, this acquisition will be sole source.
This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Flight Safety International.
 Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Ebon Neal, ebone.neal@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2010, no later than 30 October 2014 at 1400 EST. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J and A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated.  If conducted as sole source procurement with Flight Safety International, no further synopsis will be provided.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of Mission Computer spare parts to support the E-2D Tactics Trainer, Device 15F14, in Norfolk, VA. 
The contract is planned for Raytheon of Marlborough, MA under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
Raytheon, cage code 70SQ8, is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to continue production of these aircraft parts, since Raytheon is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the E-2D Aircraft Mission Computer.
 The anticipated award date is May 2015 with deliveries in 2016.  The anticipated contract value for this procurement is $800K.
Raytheon designed these spare parts to aircraft specifications and remains as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) who can meet the form, fit, function requirements necessary for timely delivery.  Ongoing market research performed by the Government supports there does not exist a commercially available item or non-developmental item to satisfy the Governments requirement.  Additionally, the Small Business Office concurred with the decision to sole source to the OEM (Raytheon). 

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice outlining the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Raytheon.
  Interested sources are solicited to provide their written technical capabilities.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Interested sources must submit detailed written technical capabilities to deliver E-2D Mission Computer spares for the Tactics Trainer to meet the needs of the Government.  Detailed written capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Romy Roman-Conway (romy.roman-conway@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with MS Word, no later than close of business on 04 November 2014. Verbal submissions via phone will not be honored. 
All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.
 Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no written challenge to this synopsis is received, a justification and approval (J and A) for other than full and open competition in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C.
 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated. If conducted as a sole source procurement, a separate synopsis will not follow. This synopsis will satisfy the intent of the requirements under FAR 5.201 and 5.204. In accordance with FAR 5.102(e), copies of the solicitation will be available upon request.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement: <br />Defense Threat Reduction (DTRA) Language Services Support.
<p>Date: October 20, 2014 <br /><br />Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement</p>
<p>Synopsis:<br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis Announcement (SSSA). The SSSAs are issued to assist the Government in performing market research to determine industry interest and sourcing capabilities. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICIATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. This is not a guarantee of a future Request For Proposal (RFP) or an award. This document should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S Government. Any information provided to the Government in response to this document will become DTRA property and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse contractors for any costs associate with responding to this Sources Sought notice.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SSSA is to identify potential sources with the requisite experience and skill sets required to provide language services (consecutive and/or simultaneous interpreting) to support meetings, negotiations, technical demonstrations, conferences and other types of international interactions that will be held in the United States, its territories, and Foreign Countries. DTRA will require the translation of all manner of documents (written and electronic) and content of video and/or audio media (compact disc, .wav files, etc.). Source material documents will contain legal, business, contractual, medical, biological research and military terminology and concepts, including those dealing with arms control and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological). Given the complexity and technical nature of DTRA's programs, a high level of interpreting/translation expertise is important to ensure the provision of the most accurate and highest quality language support possible.</p>
<p>Potential sources, either alone or with appropriate teaming partners, must demonstrate expertise and capability to perform worldwide in all physical and operational environments as detailed in the attached DRAFT Statement of Objective (SOO) and Statement of Work (SOW).</p>

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only. This announcement is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the products/services stated herein. All businesses, large and small businesses (8(a), SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is seeking vendors who are a capable of manufacturing Neutron Guides. NCNR is a large laboratory facility consisting of a suite of instruments that measure the interaction of radiation with various materials to study their structure and properties. The NCNR maintains a wide variety of instruments that allow great flexibility in the type of samples and phenomena that can be studied and measured.</p>
<p>The majority of these instruments use neutrons with energies at the low end of the energy spectrum called cold neutrons. These cold neutrons must be delivered from the neutron source to the instruments and neutron guides are used for this purpose. In much the same manner as a fiber optic cable carries light rays, the neutron guides channel the neutrons away from the source and carry them to a location where they are used to probe matter in one of the many neutron-scattering spectrometers at the NCNR. The interior of the guides is coated with a neutron-reflective material to maximize the transmission of neutrons by allowing those making contact with the interior surfaces at incident angles below a characteristic angle to be reflected and continue downstream toward the desired destination. The characteristic angle and reflection efficiency are functions of the reflective surface and coating properties and the energy of the incident neutron. In order to remain a state-of-the-art neutron scattering facility, the NCNR continues to evolve by adding new instrumentation and upgrading existing instrumentation.</p>
<p>Sources that have the ability to provide this instrument are asked to respond to this notice with a corporate capability statement of a maximum of ten (10) pages to provide a clear and complete narrative of current capabilities to meet the requirements as detailed above. Those sources are requested to respond to this notice and in so doing, provide the following information: organization information to include company name and address, size of business as it relates to NAICS code 334516 (Small Business size standard of 500 employees), current point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), list of current GSA federal supply schedules (if applicable) under which your company can provide the products described in this notice, and a list of contracts within the past three (3) years in which a similar instrument was provided. All responses shall be emailed to Lynda.Roark@nist.gov so that they are received no later than 3:00 pm EST October 31, 2014.</p>

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research. This is a Request for Information only. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified&nbsp;in the draft statement of work.<br /><br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.</p>
<p>Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.<br />PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Project Title</p>
<p>National Library of Medicine Discovery and Delivery Platform</p>
<p>Background Information</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is constantly striving to maximize the visibility, use, and value of the overall collections and make access to the library resources seamless and simple for patrons to use. LocatorPlus, NLM's online public access catalog (OPAC), has been the front-end search interface to many NLM resources managed in the Voyager integrated library system (ILS) since 1999. However, as information concepts and technology advance, the underlying technology, functionality, and user interface of conventional OPACs become obsolete and are therefore no longer aligned with user expectations. LocatorPlus is no exception.</p>
<p>In an age when most users are accustomed to powerful search engines, NLM needs to offer a modern, comprehensive discovery and delivery interface that enables users to quickly and seamlessly access the rich bibliographic data, electronic resources, and full text content of the wide range of NLM collections. This procurement intends to enhance the NLM's search interface by replacing LocatorPlus with a state-of-the-art discovery and delivery solution produced by the library information system industry.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>NLM is issuing this Statement of Work (SOW) for purchasing web-based discovery and delivery software. The Library seeks to acquire the software hosted by a vendor with the technical expertise, resources, and experience to provide NLM with an industry-leading search platform.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>The scope of this procurement is the acquisition of web-based discovery and delivery software as well as the technical, management, and support services for implementing and maintaining the platform.</p>
<p>Description of Work</p>
<p>The vendor shall host discovery and delivery software that provides a single, modern, and intuitive search platform for NLM's physical, electronic, and digital resources. It must interoperate with the library's ILS to enable users to remain in the search platform for research and traditional OPAC functionality such as requests for physical materials in the NLM collections. The software architecture should be open and extensively configurable, customizable, and expandable for incorporation of additional collection resources and for further NLM development in response to future needs. The vendor must establish security policies, procedures, and practices that meet the relevant security requirements set forth by the U.S. Federal Government.</p>
<p>A draft of the Statement of Work is attached.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of Information</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.227-14(b), the contractor shall guarantee strict confidentiality of the information/data that it is provided by the Government during the performance of the contract. The Government has determined that the information/data that the Contractor will be provided during the performance of the contract is of a sensitive nature and cannot be disclosed in any manner.</p>
<p>The Contractor, in whole or in part, can only make disclosure of the information/data, after the Contractor receives prior written approval from the Contracting Officer. Whenever the Contractor is uncertain with regard to the proper handling of information/data under the contract, the Contractor shall obtain a written determination from the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br />United States Marshals Service, Judicial Services Division, Office of Security Contracts
<p>1.0 Description</p>
<p>1.1 The United States Marshals Service (USMS) in support of the Judicial Services Division (JSD), Office of Security Contracts (OSC) is seeking information on costs associated with performing medical reviews of over 5,200 contract employees who serve in a Court Security Officer (CSO) profession.</p>
<p>The requirement consists of providing medical reviews of physical suitability for contracted employees to serve in a security officer capacity. The medical assessment duties include an in-depth review of the USMS CSO Form 229 (ATT A), in accordance with the medical requirements established in the Medical Requirements for Court Security Officers and the CSO Statement of Work Physical and Medical Standards Section C.9 (ATT B). The Reviewing Medical Physician (RMO) is responsible for requesting any additional medical information needed in order to complete the individualized assessment of the CSOs ability to meet these medical requirements and make a final medical qualification determination.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the USMS is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>The USMS JSD is committed to the protection of the judicial process - by ensuring the safe and secure conduct of judicial proceedings and protecting federal judges, jurors and other members of the federal judiciary. This mission is accomplished by anticipating and deterring threats to the judiciary. Senior Inspectors, Deputy Marshals and Court Security Officers provide security for federal court facilities in each of the 94 judicial districts and the District of Columbia Superior Court. The USMS contracts with private security companies to provide CSOs to federal judicial facilities. During 2014, JSD staff managed contracts providing over 5,200 CSOs throughout the United States and territories.</p>
<p>All CSO Applicants are required to pass an initial medical exam prior to performing on the contract. CSO Incumbents are required to undergo and pass subsequent medical exams annually while performing under the contract. This includes the review of CSO medical examinations in conjunction with Federal Occupational Health Law Enforcement Medical Programs/Department of Health &amp; Human Services, as well as coordination with applicable private security contract companies concerning CSO supplemental medical information and the tracking of medical qualifications.</p>
<p>Currently, the USMS in conjunction with the Federal Occupational Health Law Enforcement Medical Program (FOH) MRO is responsible for implementing a number of medical standards and requirements in order for an individual to qualify as a CSO. First, an incumbent CSO must submit a CSO-229 (ATT A), Certificate of Medical Examination for Court Security Officers, performed by a Contractor approved designated physician. Upon review of the CSO 229 by the MRO, a medical determination is made as to whether an individual will be able to perform the essential functions of the CSO position. Once admitted into the Court Security Program, an individual is required to submit and pass an annual physical exam performed by a USMS approved designated physician every year during his or her tenure as a CSO.</p>
<p><br />3.0 Requested Information</p>
<p>The USMS wants to determine if the private sector can assume the role of the Reviewing Medical Officer, including all costs assumed with this role. *Medical Exams will continue to be performed by the designated physician of the CSO Contracting Vendor.</p>
<p>The review process would be performed in accordance with the medical requirements established by the USMS, FOH, and the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM).</p>
<p>Currently, the CSOs must medically qualify on an annual basis. Responders must also include the ability to medically qualify the CSO on a bi-annual basis.</p>
<p>Additionally, define the turnaround time to perform and review the information on the CSO 229. (ATT A)</p>
<p><br />4.0 Instructions</p>
<p>The CSO Statement of Work Physical and Medical Standards Section C.9, along with the CSO Form 229 are attached for your review. After reviewing the material, submit your response as indicated below. Responders must include the following information for submittals:</p>
<p>A) Name of Company, Point of Contact Name, Company Mailing Address, Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail Address of designated point of contact.<br />B) DUNS Number of Company and NAICS Codes.<br />C) Brief narrative describing your firm's current business and include a brief description of experience and services offered;<br />D) Capabilities of company, including past performances providing similar services within the past three years, recent or current contracts.<br />E) Recommended Strategy - Company's ability to provide services for the United States, including territories;<br />F) Ability of company to respond with associated time frames;<br />G) Include pricing schedule for MRO services.</p>

<p>Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information.</p>
<p>Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>5.0 Industry Discussions</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, that is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note: If a proposal receives an "Unacceptable" rating after initial evaluation and will require revisions in order to meet the technical requirement, the Government reserves the right to exclude the offeror from the competitive range.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in the following relative order of importance: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>1. Price, 2. Technical Acceptability, and 3. Past Performance. Technical and past performances, when combined, are of significantly more important that cost or price. The technical and past performance evaluations will be performed beginning with the lowest priced offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the lowest priced offeror is technically acceptable, has acceptable past performance and meets all other requirements of this solicitation, the evaluation will stop and award will be made to that offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>1) Price: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A price evaluation will be performed on all offerors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors will be ranked from lowest to highest price based on the Total Evaluated Price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>2) Technical Acceptability: Technical acceptability will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Acceptable ratings will be given when the offerors proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of this combined synopsis solicitation. An unacceptable rating will be given when offerors proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the combined synopsis solicitation. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Offerors proposals will be rated on technical acceptability using the attached drawings and <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">capability to fabricate and assemble the F-22 Tail Section Work Stand</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors should pay attention careful to address all SOW requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>3) Past Performance: Past performance information may be gathered from both Government and Commercial sources. Past Performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. An "acceptable" rating is given when based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (see note below). An "unacceptable" rating is given when based on the offeror's performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Records of adverse past performance will be addressed IAW the FAR 15.306</p>

Appendix C
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE
1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S.
to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when
an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
f. Contractor will comply with VA Handbook 6500.6 that states they will ensure VA sensitive information will be protected

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written
agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not
destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated
and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business
Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for
performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the Program Manager.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
a. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.

b. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
 	(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
 (4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
c. The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
d. Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
e. A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

4.  SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the Program Manager and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-days' notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

TRAINING
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA
information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
 (1) Successfully complete the VA Privacy and Information Security and Rules of Behavior Training.
(2) Contractor will acknowledge and sign the VA Privacy for Personnel without Access to VA Computer Systems or Direct Access or Use to VA Sensitive Information

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

This BAA is for use by MHS components outside of Defense Health Agency (DHA).  This BAA can serve as a separate agreement or may be used to modify an existing contract or other agreement between the MHS component and the business associate.  It is also appropriate for new contracts or agreements.  In each case, the MHS component should consult with the Contracting Officer or other POC and the Service-level privacy officials for completing and/or modifying this BAA as may be appropriate.  At several points, bracketed language indicates where additional or different language may be needed, including specifics regarding breach response.    <br> This BAA is NOT to be used in contracts for components of DHA.  Those components should request contract language from the DHA Procurement Directorate.  Contact ContractPolicyDivision@dha.mil. <br>  <br>  <br> Business Associate Agreement <br>  <br> Introduction <br>  <br> In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(2) and 164.504(e) and paragraph C.3.4.1.3 of DoD 6025.18-R,  quote mark DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation, quote mark  January 24, 2003 [replace with corresponding paragraph in the pending successor issuance, DoDI 6025.18, Enclosure 3, when published], this document serves as a business associate agreement (BAA) between the signatory parties for purposes of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the  quote mark HITECH Act quote mark  amendments thereof, as implemented by the HIPAA Rules and DoD HIPAA Issuances (both defined below).  The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate.  The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates.  Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) [replace with corresponding paragraph in the pending successor issuance, DoDI 6025.18, Enclosure 3, when published] provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.   <br>  <br> (a) Catchall Definition.  Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use. <br>  <br> 	Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII  (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected.  The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein. <br>  <br> 	Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term  quote mark business associate quote mark  in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA]. <br>  <br> 	Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA. <br>  <br> 	Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term  quote mark covered entity quote mark  in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA]. <br>  <br> 	DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office.  The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD). <br>  <br> 	DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS).  These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007). [These citations should be replaced with citations to the pending successor issuances when those are published.] <br>  <br> 	DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).  [The latter citation should be replaced with a citation to the pending successor issuance when it is published.] <br>  <br> 	HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402. <br>  <br> 	HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the  quote mark HITECH Act quote mark  provisions of Pub. L. 111-5.  See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)).  Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules. <br> 	 <br> 	Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.  [This definition may need tailoring to the service-specific organizational structure.]   <br>  <br>  I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate <br>  <br> (a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law. <br>  <br> (b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement. <br>  <br> (c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement.  If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.     <br>  <br> (d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI. [When the pending successor issuances are published, then the preceding sentence should begin as follows:   quote mark In accordance with DoDI 6025.18, Enclosure 3, paragraph ___, DoDI 8580.02, Enclosure 3, paragraph __, and 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ... quote mark ] <br>  <br> (e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.   <br>  <br> (f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.  <br>  <br> (g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.   <br>  <br> 	(h)  To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and <br>  <br> 	(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules. <br>  <br> II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate <br>  <br> (a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law.  The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de-identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity. <br>  <br> (b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule  quote mark minimum necessary quote mark  standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.   <br>  <br> (c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.  <br>  <br> (d)  Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph. <br>  <br> (e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached. <br>  <br> (f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations. <br>  <br> III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions <br>  <br> (a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.  <br>  <br> (b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI. <br>  <br> (c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI. <br>  <br> IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity <br>  <br> The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA. <br>  <br> V. Breach Response <br>  <br> (a) In general. <br>  <br> In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable.  If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements.  A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach.  If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations.  In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances. <br>  <br> If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components.  If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office. The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.  The following provisions of Part V set forth the Business Associate's Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements for all breaches, including but not limited to HHS breaches.   <br>  <br> This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances.  In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable.  Because DoD defines  quote mark breach quote mark  to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach. <br>  <br> (b) Government Reporting Provisions <br>  <br> The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. . The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach (suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.   <br> 	 <br> The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number.  Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html. The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either.  Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US-CERT office. <br>  <br> The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil (I do not know if John has a mailbox for Privacy).    <br>  <br> If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that  quote mark single event quote mark  breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.  <br>  <br> When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text. Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc.  The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available.  Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances. <br>  <br> In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed. <br>  <br> (c) Individual Notification Provisions <br>  <br> If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted. <br>  <br> The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V(a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following: <br>  <br> -The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been breached. <br>  <br> -The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred. <br>  <br> -The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261. <br>  <br> -The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information. <br>  <br> Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g.,  quote mark Data Breach Information Enclosed, quote mark  and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach.  The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address. <br>  <br> If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval. <br>  <br> The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.  <br>  <br> Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber-security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.   <br>  <br> VI. Termination <br>  <br> (a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement. <br>  <br> (b) Effect of Termination. <br>  <br> (1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below.  If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction. <br>  <br> (2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI. <br>  <br> (3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI. <br>  <br>  VII. Miscellaneous <br>  <br> (a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the  quote mark Effect of Termination quote mark  provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement. <br>  <br> (b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules. <br>  <br> (End of clause) <br>  <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard has a requirement for contractor support services to obtain external accreditation services for a total of 35 Coast Guard ambulatory health care clinics located across the USCG enterprise in the United States and applicable territories.
<p>Services will include, but will not be limited to: providing advice and expertise; conducting surveys; providing written reports of each clinic survey based on established standards set forth in the contract organizations standards handbook; providing certification documentation and providing training to selected clinic/organizational staff in person or via webcast annually as determined by the USCG Health, Safety, and Work-Life Service Center (HSWL SC). The contractor shall furnish all necessary personnel, facilities, and material/equipment to conduct the External Accreditation Surveys for Ambulatory Health Care Clinics in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), which is attached.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with <br />the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes only the solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-15-R-P1C000 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This RFP incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-76. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 813920 with a small business size standard of $15M and is issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. The deadline for submitting a proposal package is: Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 2:00 PM, local time.</p>
<p>It is DHS policy that pricing for competitive negotiations should be based on adequate price competition. However, in the event only once responsible offeror is obtained as a result of this solicitation, that offeror may be required to submit either Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-4) or Data Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.403-3) to support price negotiations.</p>
<p>NOTE: The clinics are surveyed typically on three year rotations. Locations of health care clinics and approximate timeframes for surveys are available in the attached spreadsheet, which is to be used for pricing as well. All contract line items shall be Firm-Fixed Price (FFP). The period of performance will be one year from date of award with four one year option periods. The anticipated contract start is January 2015.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation: (1) FAR 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (FEB 1998). This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.arnet.gov. A completed copy of the provision, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009) should be included with the offer. Offerors are required to submit on-line Reps &amp; Certs (see https://orca.bpn.gov/).</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in their latest editions apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Apr 2014). The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause:</p>
<p>Note 1: The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(End of addendum)</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: In accordance with FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1) FACTOR 1: Technical Approach - will be evaluated to determine the offeror's ability to perform the requirements of the PWS (to include the dispute management process) with trained and experienced personnel in conducting surveys at US Coast Guard Health Care facilities.</p>
<p>2) FACTOR 2: Relevant Past Performance - will be evaluated for relevance and extent of previous contracts, quality and conformance of supplies/services to contract requirements, timely delivery/performance, and customer satisfaction. Past performance information (PPI) utilized in the evaluation will be obtained from contractor references, as well as any other sources which may have relevant information. Contractor references that cannot be contacted will not be considered. Greater weight (both positive and/or negative) will be given for performance under previous contracts that are more similar in scope, size and complexity to this procurement. Those offerors with no relevant past performance information will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, however, an offer with no relevant past performance history may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.</p>
<p>3) Price: The offeror's proposed price will be evaluated but not rated.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)</p>
<p>The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: <br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (May 2014)</p>
<p>The following terms and conditions are added as an addendum to this clause: <br />52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) <br />52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (Mar 1989)<br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) (insert 30 days)<br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (insert 10 days, 15 days, <br />5 years);</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI's Niger program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy objectives in Niger through support that targets drivers of instability in Niger and the region. Drivers may include, but are not limited to, political and economic exclusion, particularly among youth and marginalized groups, reintegration of returned workers and ex-combatants, the presence of extremist organizations, lack of state presence and/or good governance coupled with a lack of opportunities for political participation. OTI intends to address these critical issues through a flexible, small-grants mechanism that tailors approaches to the varied needs of communities in Niger. The program may utilize both "soft" (e.g. cultural and recreational activities, media and strategic communications) and "hard" (e.g. small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities, local actors, and the Nigerien government and to increase community cohesion. The program may also support national level activities, such as elections in 2016 or other emerging transition needs.</p>
<p>The Country Representative - Niger is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. The Country Representative's principle responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Niger program. The Country Representative will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general.  Knowledge of the sub-region is also desirable. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee, the Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees), ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI programs and activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned feed into ongoing or future activities.</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to the in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative - Niger will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, as well as the Niger Mission Director. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>While in Niger, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [x], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>Questions must be submitted by 10:00 AM PST on 20 October 2014 Any questions submitted after that time will not be taken. Please provide 24 hrs for a response. Answers will be submitted on an attachment to the reposting of the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Partial bids are not permitted in the FedBid Marketplace. Partial bid means a bid submitted through the website by a seller, which does not qualify as an acceptable bid under a Reverse Auction because it does not include all required line items or other specifications. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [XX], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMCLevel Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Brothers&nbsp;Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI's Niger program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy objectives in Niger through support that targets drivers of instability in Niger and the region. Drivers may include, but are not limited to, political and economic exclusion, particularly among youth and marginalized groups, reintegration of returned workers and ex-combatants, the presence of extremist organizations, lack of state presence and/or good governance coupled with a lack of opportunities for political participation. OTI intends to address these critical issues through a flexible, small-grants mechanism that tailors approaches to the varied needs of communities in Niger. The program may utilize both "soft" (e.g. cultural and recreational activities, media and strategic communications) and "hard" (e.g. small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities, local actors, and the Nigerien government and to increase community cohesion. The program may also support national level activities, such as elections in 2016 or other emerging transition needs.</p>
<p>The Country Representative - Niger is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. The Country Representative's principle responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Niger program. The Country Representative will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general.  Knowledge of the sub-region is also desirable. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee, the Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees), ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI programs and activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned feed into ongoing or future activities.</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to the in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative - Niger will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, as well as the Niger Mission Director. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>

This project will provide spot repairs along two hiking trails, as well as replace pedestrian bridge structures damaged in a 2013 flood event.<br /><br />Design-build has been selected as the procurement method for this project due to the extreme access and weather conditions at the project site, accelerated construction timeline necessitated by the monsoon season and flash flood threat, and design and fitting requirements of major pedestrian structures. <br /><br />The major work elements include debris removal, trail restoration, construction of a suspended Catwalk Trail bridge section, and various pedestrian bridges. The majority of work will take place in a confined slot canyon with limited access to equipment and personnel. Construction within the canyon must be substantially complete before the monsoon season (June 30), only providing a construction weather window of approximately 3 months. The Catwalk Trail bridge section consists of a pedestrian bridge suspended or supported along the irregular cliff face of the slot canyon, requiring detailed measurements and shop drawings for a proper fit. <br /><br />The proposed project is for spot repairs and reconstruction at damaged sites, at an estimated cost between $3M and $5M. The primary scopes of work include debris removal, trail restoration, construction of Catwalk Trail bridge structure and overlooks, and construction of various pedestrian bridges. Significant quantities include:<br /><br />Trail Restoraiton 3000 LNFT<br />Catwalk Bridge Trail Structure 600 LNFT<br />Pedestrian Bridges 3 EACH

<DESC><div>The US Agency for International Development (USAID) Zambia intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract for the principal malaria control activity acquired by the USAID/Zambia Mission directly. &nbsp;USAID/Zambia intends to support the GRZ&rsquo;s Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health (MCDMCH) by providing support to the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) efforts in the prevention and control of malaria. &nbsp;USAID/Zambia, through an implementing partner, intends to provide technical support to 1) strengthen malaria prevention and case management activities at health facilities and community level, 2) build management capacity of the district and provincial level to provide oversight/ supervision of malaria interventions, 3) improve data reporting, analysis, and use for decision-making by strengthening the Health Management Information System (HMIS), and 4) empower communities to take ownership of the malaria problem and work with governmental and non-governmental entities to control malaria in their communities.&nbsp;</div>
<div>USAID/Zambia previously provided similar support to the GRZ through the Health Systems Strengthening Program (HSSP) from 2005 to 2010 and the Zambia Integrated Systems Strengthening Program (ZISSP) from 2010 to 2014.&nbsp;The incumbent contractor is Abt Associates, Inc. a large for-profit U.S. business, under a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract identified as Task Order No. AID-GHS-I-11-07-00003 covering the period of 06/15/2010 through 12/13/2014.</div>
<div>The Program for the Advancement of Malaria Outcomes (PAMO) will be the flagship malaria activity for PMI in Zambia. The purpose of the PAMO is to contribute to reducing malaria mortality by two-thirds, malaria incidence by three-fourths, and malaria parasitemia in children under age five by one-half in targeted provinces in alignment with the Project Appraisal Document (Improving the Health Status of Zambians FY 2014-2019). This will be achieved by increasing access to and uptake of quality malaria control interventions. The activity will align strategically with the National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP) 2011-2016 to support the national vision of &ldquo;a malaria-free Zambia by 2030.&rdquo; &nbsp;PAMO will be a key partner in PMI&rsquo;s endeavor to support malaria control in Zambia. &nbsp;PAMO will strengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Community Development Mother and Child Health&rsquo;s (MCDMCH) capacity to implement the NMSP at provincial, district, and community levels. The project will build strong effective partnerships with communities, civil society, health facilities, District Community Medical Offices (DCMO), Provincial Medical Offices (PMO), the private sector, and cooperating partners to scale-up and maintain internationally accepted strategies to fight malaria.&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span></div>

<p>Background<br />Federal government agencies, in conjunction with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), have the responsibility to prohibit discrimination within the civil service on the basis of race, color, religion or religious accommodation, sex, national origin, age, disability or disability accommodation, genetic information, reprisal for opposition to discrimination or participation in the complaint process, and sexual orientation.<br />Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service are not covered under the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws or subject to the provisions of Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) &sect;1614.  However, Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" establishes the rights of Commissioned Corps Officers to be free from discrimination and retaliation.<br />Complaints of EEO discrimination alleged by employees of federal agencies or applicants for federal employment covered by Title 29 C.F.R. &sect; 1614 and any subsequent law, statute, regulation, or directive are included within the scope of this Statement of Work (SOW).  Commissioned Corps Officers of the U.S. Public Health Service covered by the Commissioned Corps Personnel Manual, INSTRUCTION 6, Subchapter CC26.1, "Equal Opportunity: Discrimination Complaints Processing" are also included within the scope of this Statement of Work. <br />Objectives</p>
<p>Title 29 CFR Part 1614 requires federal agencies to develop and implement equal employment opportunity programs and complaint processing procedures.  EEOC Management Directive EEO MD-110 implements the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1614.  Federal agencies perform a portion of the required EEO services in house.  This statement of work will outline the roles and responsibilities of each party when the Ordering Agency (Agency) needs to contract out investigative, EEO counseling, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and drafting Final Agency Decision (FAD) functions.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>Investigations of Formal EEO Complaints<br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor.  Three types of discrimination complaints may be investigated; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.

Three types of discrimination complaints may be counseled; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the EEO Counseling is usually performed in four major phases: (a) Interviewing the Counselee, Responsible Management Official(s) (RMO), and witnesses; (b) framing the claims and drafting management's and witnesses' responses to the claims; (c) obtaining documentary evidence and statistical information; and (d) preparing the counseling report and related documents.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)<br />The Agency will determine when an aggrieved person or complainant is to be referred to the Contractor for ADR services.  Three types of discrimination complaints may be referred; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is usually performed in six major phases: (a) Reviewing the Agency dispute file; (b) Developing an ADR Action Plan; (c) Setting up Meetings/Caucuses between the Parties; (d) Reviewing the ADR process with the Parties; (e) Identifying the issues; and either (f) Assisting the Parties in putting a proposed settlement agreement in writing and develop a draft settlement agreement or notifying the Parties if efforts to settle the dispute have been unsuccessful.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.</p>
<p>Drafting a Final Agency Decision <br />The Agency will issue the case assignment to the Contractor.  Three types of discrimination complaints may require written FADs; the categories are: individual, consolidated, and class complaints.  Regardless of the type of discrimination complaint, the FAD is usually performed in four major phases: (a) reviewing the Report of Investigation (ROI); (b) Drafting a presentation of facts; (c) conducting and drafting a legal analysis of the claims based on the information and evidence in the ROI; and (d) drafting recommended findings, conclusions, and, if applicable, appropriate remedies.  The Contractor shall perform work in accordance with the revised and most current editions of applicable laws, regulations, and executive orders that pertain to each case assignment issued under this contract and provided by the Agency to the Contractor.  The Contractor will also use, unless otherwise indicated by the COR, documents and forms provided by the Agency.<br />Investigation of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Reports of Investigation<br />The purpose of this subsection is to obtain Reports of Investigation in conformance with the standards established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  Investigations shall be performed to identify and obtain evidence from all relevant sources and gather sufficient information, relevant to the accepted issues in the complaint, to determine the validity of the allegations.  If the Agency determines a violation of the applicable laws occurred, the Report of Investigation must provide the Agency with a sufficient factual basis from which to fashion an appropriate remedy.<br />Investigations shall include a thorough review of the circumstances under which the alleged discrimination occurred and the treatment of others not of the complainant's class in the organizational segment.  Additionally, the investigation shall require a review of any policies and practices related to the alleged discrimination.  <br />1.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS), Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint and the number of issues contained in each complaint.  Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint and/or number of issues, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.  If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2. EEO Counseling of Discrimination Complaints and Preparation of Counseling Reports<br />2.1 Purpose<br />The purpose of the EEO Counseling inquiry is to obtain information regarding the claim(s), address jurisdictional questions, and attempt to facilitate a resolution to the Counselee's requested remedy.  The EEO Counselor should interview persons who can provide information that is relevant to the claim(s), settlement, and jurisdictional questions.  The EEO counseling inquiry is not an "investigation" nor is it intended to resolve disputed facts; rather, it is simply gathering information necessary for the EEO Counselor to assist the parties in resolving the matter.  The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency.  Documents generated through EEO Counseling should adhere to Agency formats, style guide requirements, and unless approved in writing, use Agency-provided forms and materials.<br />2.2 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the  Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint.  Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.  If disagreements cannot be resolved, the Agency reserves the right to terminate the case assignment.<br />2.3 Requirements of the Contractor<br />To perform EEO counseling, the Contractor shall:<br />Provide to the ACP within 2 business days from receipt of case assignment the name, contact information, and, if not previously provided, documentation of current counseling certification. <br />Furnish all essential equipment, materials, personnel, and supplies necessary to perform all of the work detailed herein, including conducting EEO counseling and preparing the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor will immediately notify the ACP in writing providing details sufficient for the ACP to advise Agency leadership if any of the following occurs:<br />Any individual involved in the EEO Counseling process advises that he/she needs a reasonable accommodation or is unable to perform work duties due to a disability.<br />Any individual involved in the EEO counseling process advises that he/she is a threat to himself or others, or words to that effect, or that any other employee or contractor is a threat to self or others or words to that effect.<br />Conduct EEO Counseling via telephonic interviews, unless otherwise impracticable, at which point in-person interviews are permitted with prior written authorization from the COR.  Any alternate method for conducting EEO Counseling must be approved in writing and in advance, of the EEO counseling, by the COR.<br />The EEO Counselor shall contact the Counselee within three (3) days of assignment to schedule the Initial interview.<br />The Initial interview with the Counselee should be conducted as soon as possible after receiving assignment, but no later than eight (8) days of assignment.  If the Counselee has provided documentation of representation using the Agency-provided form, the EEO Counselor must include the representative in all correspondence, email, telephone conversations, interviews, and any other contact with the Counselee.  Unusual circumstances that may prevent conducting the interview immediately; e.g., illness, emergency leave, priority assignments, must be brought to the attention of the ACP.<br />The EEO Counselor should request , within two (2) business days of the initial interview with Counselee, any documents from the ACP and/or the COR that the EEO Counselor believes are relevant to the limited inquiry.  <br />The EEO Counselor must request all relevant documentation regarding the matters raised in counseling from the ACP and the Counselee only (all requests for documents, except for requests to the Counselee, must be made to the ACP or COR). <br />The EEO Counselor must instruct the Counselee to submit all requested/offered documents to the ACP and instruct all witnesses to submit any documents they offer in support of their interviews to the ACP EEO Counselor.  The EEO Counselor will review the documents and determine they are to be included in the EEO Counselor's Report within three (3) business days of receipt from the Counselee/witnesses. If the EEO Counselor has any questions regarding the inclusion of the submitted documents with the EEO Counselor's Report, then the EEO Counselor shall check with the ACP for guidance on the matter.  <br />The EEO Counselor shall interview all witnesses, including the RMO, within twenty (20) days of the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency. Prior to contacting anyone other than the Counselee, and if applicable, the Counselee's representative, the EEO Counselor must obtain written authorization from the ACP or COR.<br />The Contractor must notify the ACP immediately if a Counselee or witness refuses to cooperate with the limited inquiry.  The ACP will take appropriate steps to secure the witness' cooperation and remind the witness of his/her duty to cooperate with the inquiry.  If the Counselee and/or witness ultimately fail to cooperate with the EEO Counselor, the EEO Counselor must document all attempts to secure the cooperation of that uncooperative witness or Counselee in the Counseling Report and attach any documentation, such as emails, to the Report. <br />The EEO Counselor must control the inquiry at all times and seek guidance and assistance from the Agency.  <br />The EEO Counselor shall write-up each interview after completion, and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />The EEO Counselor shall review and summarize all documents relevant to the claim(s) and incorporate the information into the Counselor's Report.<br />If the EEO Counselor believes the inquiry is deficient procedurally, or in content or scope, he/she shall immediately notify the COR.<br />By the 26th day after the Counselee's Initial contact with the Agency, if the EEO Counselor has not completed the counseling process, the EEO Counselor should contact the Counselee regarding obtaining an extension.<br />A Counselee may agree, in writing, to postpone the Final Interview and extend the period for pre-complaint counseling for up to or less than sixty (60) additional calendar days from the date of the Initial contact.<br />Any extension of counseling must be requested by the EEO Counselor to the ACP and/or COR prior to the expiration of the initial thirty (30) day period.<br />Because timely completion of Pre-complaint counseling increases the probability of informal resolution and minimizes the negative impact that protracted inquiries have on the work environment, requests for extensions of EEO Counseling should be requested from the COR and/or ACP only in the following instances:</p>
<p>With the written consent of the Counselee; or<br />Requested by the Counselee; or<br />Unusual circumstances which prevented completion of the counseling inquiry during the initial thirty (30) day period, i.e., illness, travel, or emergency leave of the Counselee, a primary witness; or<br />When the Agency believes that informal resolution is likely or imminent, and a short additional counseling period is necessary to consummate an agreement.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor should attempt to facilitate a resolution of the pre-complaint.  If the Counselee and the Agency agree to an informal resolution of the dispute during the course of the EEO counseling inquiry, the terms of the informal resolution should be reduced to writing, and provided to the ACP or COR, and sent to the EEO Office for final review and approval by the EEO Office for form and compliance purposes. The EEO Counselor may not provide said document to anyone other than the ACP or COR.</p>
<p>If the Counselee elects to withdraw the Pre-complaint, the withdrawal must be obtained in writing using Agency-provided forms.</p>
<p>The EEO Counselor is responsible for submitting a final Counselor's Report, regardless of whether the Pre-complaint is withdrawn, settled, resolved, went to ADR or is completed in any other manner, along with all paperwork gathered during the counseling process to the EEO office within three (3) days of conducting the Final Interview, within three (3) days of the conclusion of EEO Counseling, whether by final interview or otherwise, but no later than the 29th day from the Counselor's Initial contact with the Agency, unless the Counselee has authorized an extension using Agency-provided forms.  If such an extension was granted, the Counseling materials are due no later than seven (7) days before the end of the extension period.</p>
<p><br />Submit a weekly status report of all open EEO Counseling cases to the COR; or submit a status report of any and all open EEO Counseling cases upon the request of the COR in a format acceptable to the COR.</p>
<p>Perform EEO Counseling and have access to data related to any complaint only after providing a signed Nondisclosure Agreement for all personnel assigned under this Statement of Work.<br />Review all relevant personnel records and statistical data and make copies as needed for inclusion in the Counselor's Report.<br />3.

Preparation of Final Agency Decisions<br />4.1 Agency and Agency Contact Person <br />The Contractor will be provided an Agency Contact Person (ACP) at the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity Staff (DM &amp; EEO).  The ACP is to be determined when the service is ordered and specified on the case assignment by the Agency.  The ACP will make the determination of the category of the complaint.   Disagreements between the Agency and the Contractor should be resolved by discussion between the ACP and the Contractor.  If a modification to the original case assignment is required as a result of discussions between the ACP and the Contractor, the ACP shall revise the case assignment to reflect the agreed upon category of complaint, and send the revised case assignment to the Contractor.

The Government was not able to issue a full and open competitive solicitation because IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial has had a five year exclusive agreement with Lockheed Martin, the OEM for the JSF, for the JSF tools and toolboxes, and continue to work closely with the Lockheed Martin procurement and tool management personnel. IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial independently developed and created the Design Control Activity for this program.

<p>"Source Selection Information - see FAR 2.101 and 3.104"</p>
<p>1. Identification of the agency and contracting activity. <br />a. Federal agency and contracting activity. National Institutes of Health<br /><br />b. Sponsoring organization. <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR),<br />Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular<br />Biology (LBMB)<br /><br />c. Project Officer information. <br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br /><br />a. Acquisition purpose and objectives. <br />The Telomere Biology section within the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (LBMB) plans to procure on a sole source basis the DeltaVision Elite Imaging research microscope system for the purpose of conducting cutting-edge microscopy to investigate the underlying mechanisms of chromosome biology, including heterochromatin formation, chromosome segregation, chromosome organization, and telomere maintenance, and to discover the causative effect of defects in these fundamental processes, in particular as they pertain to the initiation of cancer cell states.</p>
<p>b. Project background. <br />The Telomere Biology section investigates many aspects of chromosome biology, including heterochromatin formation, chromosome segregation, regulation of genome stability, and maintenance of telomeres. Particularly relevant to this acquisition is our focus on the cell biology of chromosome structure and telomere biology.</p>
<p>Telomeres are specialized protein-DNA structures located at the ends of chromosomes. Proper telomere maintenance is critical for many fundamental cellular processes, such as chromosome segregation, stem cell proliferation, and prevention of translocations that can lead to cancer. In order to investigate telomere function as well as other aspects of chromosome biology, such as chromosome organization, compaction, and structure, a high speed, super-resolution microscope capable of multiple imaging applications is needed to meet the goals of the laboratory. These microscope systems will be used by members of Telomere Biology to image live cells in 3D at high speed and with high resolution.</p>
<p>3. Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). <br /><br />A. Project title. DeltaVision Elite Research Microscope System<br /><br />B. Project description. <br />The Telomere Biology section within LBMB investigates the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome biology. LBMB laboratories study how chromosomes are accurately segregated, how they are organized, how compacted domains are formed, how gene expression patterns are regulated, and how structure contributes to the maintenance of genome stability. We also investigate the biology of telomeres. Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes in eukaryotic cells and are critical for maintaining the stability and function of the genome. Disruptions in telomere function can critically impair cellular function, and lead to undesirable translocations and genome instability that can result in development of cancers. The lab takes a multidisciplinary approach, leveraging the power of yeast genetics, biochemistry, and cutting edge cell biological techniques, in the investigation of the biology surrounding chromosomes and the many mechanisms that ensure their stable maintenance.</p>

Acquisition identification number. Requisition number: 3437993 Presolicitation number: N02RC42599-83<br /><br />d. Total estimated dollar value and performance/delivery period. <br />The total cost, including delivery, set up and training, is estimated to be<br />$. Delivery estimate is 90 days.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br />a. Acquisition Authority</p>
<p>&bull; . This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(__) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302- __.</p>
<p>&#61694;X This acquisition is conducted under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) <br /><br />b. Demonstration that the proposed contractor(s) unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br />&bull; Name and address of the proposed contractor(s). <br />GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, 800 Centennial Ave.,<br />Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327<br />&bull; Nature of the acquisition and proposed unique qualifications of the contractor(s). <br />NCI has the need of an advanced microscope imaging system capable of high resolution microscopy. The system LBMB seeks to acquire consists of the DeltaVision Elite Imaging Systems, from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences. This system comprises revolutionary and cutting edge technology that combine to deliver a product capable of super high resolution live cell imaging. Listed below are some of the required features that are provided exclusively on the DeltaVision Imaging Systems:</p>
<p>1. TruLight Illumination, developed and offered exclusively on the DeltaVision Elite system, eliminates the need for excitation filters, providing instead a 7 channel box. This allows for extremely rapid automated switching between illumination channels, and between viewing and imaging modes. This reduces the exposure time needed for imaging. TruLight allows detection and imaging of small organelles due to reduced signal to noise and concentration of light to the sample. This feature is particularly important for structural imaging of fission yeast.</p>
<p>2. Ultimate Focus technology that maintains the Z-series focus throughout long time lapses within 25nm. This technology is exclusive to DeltaVision Elite system and is a patent pending design. The absolute accuracy of the stage system is &lt;1 Oum per 25mm (x,y), and &lt;.6um per 13 um (z). This also ensures superior repeatability in all planes (0.2um in x,y and 0.1 um in z axes).</p>
<p>3. Stage control with patented NanoMotion III Precision Control motors allows precise control and stability for 3D imaging, offered exclusively on the DeltaVision Elite system.</p>
<p>4. Environmental control that is required for long term imaging experiments, allowing control of temperature and C02 conditions throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>5. Ability to do point-visiting within a single or time-lapse experiment (up to 4,000 user designated points can be imaged in a single experiment). We need the ability to combine high temporal resolution with the high structural and spatial resolution provided by the combined technology offered with the DeltaVision system.</p>
<p>6. Deconvolution of acquired stacked images, allowing improved image resolution and contrast. Applied Precision offers the best deconvolution system currently on the market.</p>
<p>7. Optical Axis Integration, allowing rapid acquisition of a Z axis defined range with lower total light exposure, preserving the sample integrity while gathering the total cellular image.</p>
<p>8. The CMOS camera for the DeltaVision Elite offers an expanded field of view (2k x 2k pixels) and has only 1 e- of read noise. It can be run at over 400 frames per second.</p>
<p>5. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost/price to the Government will be fair and reasonable. <br />The NCI contract specialist will consider the independent government estimate and previous purchase order prices as a determining factor for reasonableness. Based on the aforementioned, there is no reason to believe that price will not be fair and reasonable to the Government. A final determination will be conducted prior to the award of this contract.</p>
<p>6. Description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>To the knowledge of the Contracting Officer's Representative, GE Healthcare is the sole US manufacture of the DeltaVision Elite. NCI has discussed LCMB research needs with colleagues, at universities and at the NIH, and with company representatives to determine the state of technology on the market and how DeltaVision compares. As a result, LCMB research has led to the following conclusions: 1) no other company or small business manufactures these systems, 2) no other company makes a device or system that can perform similarly, or at least achieve comparable imaging results, and 3) no other company offers a device or system with the necessary features to achieve similar or superior results. In particular, the TruLight Illumination, Ultimate Focus technology and ability to do point-visiting (marking up to 4,000 locations for imaging), as well as the inclusion of the sCMOS camera capable of an expanded field of view with low noise capable of over 400 frames per second are unique to the DeltaVision system. These features are described in Section 4b. Thus, LCMB have concluded from our research that the DeltaVision Elite systems offer the unique features that we require for our research.</p>
<p>7. Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable. Indicate whether a FedBizOpps notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies. <br /><br />A sources sought notice was posted on September 12, 2014 with a response date of September 18, 2014. A combined synopsis/ solicitation notice was posted on FedBizOpps on September 18, 2014 with a response date of September 24, 2014; 11:00 am EST. No responses were received in response to the sources sought notice and combined synopsis/ solicitation notice.<br /><br />8. Any other facts supporting the justification. None.<br /><br />9. Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the required supplies or services. <br />a. Removal of barriers to competition. There are no future plans to acquire this device again.</p>
<p>b. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed an interest, in writing, in the acquisition. No other sources expressed interest in this acquisition.</p>

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($3K to $150K)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 20, for the Puget Sound VA Medical Center under purchase request 663-15-1-213-0006

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed:  A new firm-fixed contract will be awarded for Neuro Kinetics software and maintenance support of I-Portal/NOTC audiology equipment. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
Purchase Request number 663-15-1-213-0006, for annual full service maintenance and repair contract on I-Portal Audiology equipment. The services consist of semi-annual preventative maintenance and an associated comprehensive service report. Any replacement parts will be new with similar features and functionality. Neuro Kinetics is the manufacturer of the I-Portal NOTC and VNG systems, and all critical software and hardware.  

The estimated value of the base year is $21,000.00. The estimated total contract value is $105,000.00 for a base and four option years contract. Estimated Period of Performance for the base year is December 15, 2014 through December 14, 2015.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is the selected vendor, Neuro Kinetics, has sole proprietary rights to perform the required service. Per FAR Part 6.302-1(b)(2), "The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copy rights, or secret processes or similar circumstances make the services available from only one source." As this time, no other vendor has the capability of fulfilling the requirement.  
 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Neuro Kinetics, Inc. (NKI) is the sole manufacturer and marketer of the I?Portal family of products. These products include NKI's VEST software, I-Portal software, and I-Portal hardware, and are protected by wide range of trademarks, copyrights, patents and pending patents in the US and other countries.

Software and Service Agreements provide updates to Neuro Kinetics proprietary VEST software.  Neuro Kinetics, Inc. is the sole designer, manufacturer, and seller of the I?Portal NOTC system and the VEST software platform. VEST software can only work on NKI's I-Portal products. NKI products, software, software updates, and support are only available directly from Neuro Kinetics, Inc.


6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
The contract specialist posted a special notice on FBO to publicize the VA's intent to solicit from a single source. The notice was available on October 20, 2014.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
The anticipated cost to the Government is $105,000.00 for a base and three option years. Price reasonableness is based on a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases of similar requirements. VA purchase order number VA260-13-P-2866, in the amount of $16,000.00, was a service contract on the same equipment, however only issued for a single upgrade as opposed to a base year plus four optional years of service. Pricing was also determined to be fair and reasonable by comparing the independent government estimate to similar published pricing. Additionally, the price offer is very comparable to the Government cost estimate. If the Government was to forego a preventive maintenance contract, individual repairs, parts, and maintenance of the equipment could be higher than the yearly cost of the service agreement. The cost to the Government is considered fair and reasonable based on a comparison of prices found reasonable on previous purchases. 


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
a.	Procurement List Ability One was checked via "I-Portal" and returned no results
b.	Unicor was checked with the same search word with no results
c.	No available companies were found via a GSA FSS search.
d.	Market research was conducted by reviewing past procurements for I-Portal software (VA260-13-P-2866)
e.	Equipment uses software which is copyrighted and considered to be intellectual property of Nuero Kinetics. The VA equipment requires software upgrades only available from the manufacturer. Per a letter from the manufacturer, "Neuro Kinetics, Inc. is the sole designer, manufacturer, and seller of the I?Portal NOTC system and the VEST software platform. VEST software can only work on NKI's I-Portal products."


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
No other facts beyond what has been described above are available to support restricting competition. 
	

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
No vendors expressed interest in writing at this time. 



11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
Before awarding any subsequent actions, market research will be conducted to determine if outside vendor are then able to provide the required service.

12.	 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c) :

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

13.	Approvals IAW VHAPM, Volume Six, Chapter VI, SOP 3.2.1 and VHAPM, Volume 6, Chapter VI: OFOC SOP:
