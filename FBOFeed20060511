Inc. to develop and provide a Satellite Based Augmentation System/Wide Area Augmentation System (SBAS/WAAS)receiver that will be simultaneously certified to TSO-C145a Beta-3/TSO-C146a Delta 4.  CMC has previously completed the first part of developing this receiver under a separate FAA contract.  This development included a PDR and a successful demonstration of a bench tested working prototype and the FAA considered these activities  successful and complete.  The FAA's best interest is to acquire subject receiver from CFC for the following reasons:  (1) The prototype built in the first phase is a proprietary design developed by CMC and only their developers know the prototype's design and they are the only providers that can successfully take the prototype from bench test to a certified unit, and (2) The original contract included two phases the first of which culminated with a bench test of a prototype receiver.  However, the FAA did not exercise the second part of the contract which was for the delivery of two certified SBAS/WAAS receivers.  Should the reader of this notice choose to challenge the above statements, please send notice to the contracting officer at jose.benitez@faa.gov.  A telephone call or a mere statement of qualification will not be sufficient.  The challenger to this notice will have to send detailed information of its capabilities to satisfy this requirement.

<DESC>In accordance with AMS policy 3.2.2.4, the FAA is notifying the public of its intent to make a single source award to EtQ, for their proprietary software system.  A competitive purchase of EtQ software was solicited in 2003 for use.  EtQ developed a system for tracking Corrective Action Requests (CARS) and Flight Standards Evaluation Program (FSEP) transmittals.  EtQ has the requisite knowledge and experience needed for the level of programming for projects in accordance with this software.  A review of Internet sites that referenced EtQ listed only the company's and company related sites.  A search of GSA Advantage provided lists of senior process analyst/consultants, but none had EtQ programming experience.  The hourly rate was in line with other senior process analyst/consultants. The period of performance for this contract is one base year and three one-year options.  The total estimated potential value of this contract is not expected to exceed: $774,100.00.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION SERVICES for the Upgrades to the HVAC System at the Paul H. Findley Federal Building located at 600 East Monroe, Springfield, Illinois. 

The project includes replacing the heating and cooling, energy management, and ceiling systems.  Most of the HVAC system units are over 45 years old and have the following problems: insufficient cooling for computers & modern office equipment; inadequate fresh air; improper zoning; and frequent breakdowns.  Work must be phased to allow for tenants to swing from their current space to a temporary location, and then back.  The building will be fully occupied during construction.  There is limited swing space for tenant moves.  The construction contractor will be mindful of tenant disruptions, schedule and noise.  The construction contractor will communicate with building management, advising schedule plans at least two weeks in advance.  The swing space will need some alterations to accommodate the various tenants electrical and data/phone needs.  Some of the work will be performed after normal business hours (6:00pm-6:00am, weekends, and holidays) allowing the smaller tenants to remain in their space and not impact tenant operations.  Noisy and with offensive odor construction activities will be required to occur after normal business hours.  Existing furniture may need to be temporarily removed to accommodate construction.  The estimated cost of this project falls within the range of $5.0 million to $10.0 million with an anticipated project duration of approximately 700 calendar days.  Funds are currently available for this acquisition.  A firm-fixed price contract is contemplated.  Contractor selection will be made in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), Part 15 for Source Selection Procedures, using the “best value” procurement procedures.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the “best value” to the Government, considering both the technical factors and the evaluated price.  For this procurement, the technical factors will be equally important as price.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  Following the technical and price evaluations, oral presentations (interviews) will be conducted.  Offerors may be afforded the opportunity for proposal revisions.  The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 238220.  In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns.  Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate.  In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.  In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract.  Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 238220.  Potential offerors having the capabilities to perform the services described herein are invited to respond by submitting the following information: a one-page letter on company letterhead stating interest in the project; a copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the State or local jurisdiction to conduct business (containing at a minimum the following information- name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company); a valid DUNS number for the business whose license is presented (If a company does not have a Duns number please contact Dun & Bradstreet at (1-800-362-3425); a valid IRS Tax ID number for the business whose license is presented; and a valid picture state drivers license of the person(s) to whom the documentation is to be entrusted.  Firms providing this information will be provided a copy of the Request for Proposals (RFP) package (specifications and drawings).  The tentative date for release of the RFP is May 26, 2006.  The RFP will provide additional information regarding the proposal submission format.  Letters of interest and support documentation should be mailed to Ms. Johnnie A. Gaskew, Contracting Officer, GSA, PBS, Property Development Division - 5PE, 230 S. Dearborn Street, Room 3512, Mail Stop 35-12, Chicago, Illinois, 60604, or Faxed to (312) 886-4103.  Once GSA has received the proper information, each contractor will be faxed a Document Security Form (2 pages) in which they must sign and fax back.  Failure to sign and return by fax will delay your company from receiving the RFP.  

NOTICE: A Pre-Proposal meeting and Site-Visit will be held.  The exact time and date will be posted later in FedBizOpps.

Any further announcements regarding this solicitation will be posted in FedBizzOpps at www.eps.gov.

Sample collection and data analyses will be coordinated to provide states with sufficient data for the Clean Water Act.  The University of Kansas has previously conducted assessment using EMAP methods.  Continued use of the University of Kansas for this service will maintain continuity in approach from previous assessments and promote the integration of EMAP data into state river monitoring programs.

The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" at this time.  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.

<RESPDATE>052606
<ARCHDATE>06262006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Joshua Bowers, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2104
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Strategic Vision for a Vehicle Experience Study for the years 2004 - 2006.  EPA has recently proposed revisions to how fuel economy estimates are calculated for the fuel economy window stickers.   The goal of EPA's new window sticker calculations is to derive fuel economy estimates that reflect real-world conditions better than the current method, thus  resulting in mile-per-gallon estimates that better approximate the actual values achieved by consumers.  There is only limited data to date regarding real-world fuel economy achieved by consumers.   Strategic Vision conducts the Vehicle Experience Study (VES), a syndicated study of new car and  truck buyers which is conducted annually for the OEM's, suppliers, agencies and others involved with the automotive industry.  EPA/OTAQ intends to purchase study results that includes consumer responses regarding their actual and expected fuel economy.  Over 120,000 respondents reported data  regarding fuel economy survey questions during the years of data that EPA/OTAQ is purchasing (2004-2006).   Further, the study provides information concerning buyer characteristics, behaviors and experiences.  Many automotive manufacturers use this study as their primary source of buyer  information.   The VES survey questionnaires include a subset of questions related to fuel economy that are of particular interest to EPA/OTAQ. These questions gather the following information: Vehicle purchased (by make/model/series); Key automotive segmentations;	 Fuel, engine and vehicle body  type characteristics (e.g. fuel type, transmission, # cylinders, etc.); Mileage (City/Highway - Actual/Expected); Location (State, Region, County, Zip).   These data, collected in the quantity and manner as is done by Strategic Vision, are entirely unique.  The VES survey has more than 90,000  respondents annually, with over 10 years of history available, amounting to over one million potential data points.   The survey tracks vehicle models down to the trim level, and the questionnaire content consists of all parts of the vehicle ownership experience, from the values and attitudes of  the buyer to how the vehicle performs months after the vehicle is purchased.  No other known single survey can provide this depth and breadth of data.  Strategic Vision owns the Vehicle Experience Study and is therefore the only possible source for the data. This data will result in direct benefits  to EPA.   Purchase of this study includes: (1) Large overall total annual sample of new vehicle buyers. (2) Three years of VES history (2004 - 2006). (3) Data access by mTAB, an analytical software package. (4) Names provided by most manufacturers ensuring more accurate samples. (5) Extensive  samples available by series - e.g. X5 series broken out by 3.0i, 4.4i, and 4.6i. (6) Access to consultation and training on key issues designated as important by the EPA. (7) A study that is used in various ways and accepted by every automotive manufacture, for most as their primary source of buyer  information. EPA market research indicates that Strategic Vision is uniquely qualified to provide this study. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of providing such data.  Such documentation must be  submitted in writing to the EPA Point of Contact within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice, prior to Friday, May 26, 2006 at 10:00 AM eastern time. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Submit technical documentation  referencing RFQ-OH-06-00128 via email to bowers.joshua@epa.gov or via fax at 513-487-2107. For questions related to this procurement, please contact Mr. Josh Bowers at 513-487-2104.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a noncompetitive basis to University of Houston to develop anatomical high-resolution models of an adult and a child. The models will be generated from scans of MR images using the novel Total Imaging Matrix (TIM) system from Siemens. Once the MRI images are obtained, the different organ and tissue regions on the MR images will be identified by an expert team of physicians and biologists with the help of semi-automated software. Based on these data, three-dimensional Computer Aided Design (CAD) models will be generated using interpolation techniques to avoid the staircased transition between the MR images. The final models will consist of multiple CAD objects with smooth surfaces. These models will be used by FDA scientists, using software currently available to them, to calculate the effects of various radiological exposures to specific parts of the human body. A crucial part of this work is to perform MR images segmentation and develop CAD model using the Amira 4.0 software package. The contractor will lead two graduate students working with physicians to develop such CAD models. They will also import these models directly into electromagnetic simulation software packages and perform preliminary electromagnetic dosimetry simulation to test the developed models. The selected group at University of Houston has extensive experience in developing human subject CAD models for electromagnetic related dosimetry research. This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. FDA intends to make an award fifteen (15) days following the date of this notice. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>WILLIAM TENZ, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2885
<DESC>The US Army, TACOM-Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny, NJ anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal(RFP)for  the production of the Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze  Setter (EPIAFS).  The RFP will be for one production year with options  for an additional four production years, for a total five production  years. The EPIAFS system will be capable of setting the XM982  Excalibur projectiles and all NATO standard inductive fuzes.  The EPIAFS system consists of three electronic components: A  Platform Integration Kit (PIK), a handheld Setter, and a setter  to gun Cable.  The PIK is a gun-mounted data processor that sends  and manages the data stream from multiple interfaces. The setter  is a handheld device which inductively couples data and power to  either the Excalibur projectile or applicable fuzes.  When used  alone, the Setter must replicate the functionality of the M1155  PIAFS.  When connected with the Cable to a Howitzer with an  automated fire control system, such as the Light Weight (LW)  155 Towed Howitzer M777A2 or the M109A6 Paladin Digital Fire  Control System, the EPIAFS can receive and inductively supply a  stream of data, power, and timing pulses to initialize a precision  guided GPS projectile such as Excalibur.  Excalibur is a GPS  Precision Guided Munition which requires power and Gun, Target,  Fuze, and GPS data to be sent over an inductive interface to  initialize the projectile. Funds are available for this acquisition.   The request for Proposal will address a requirement to propose  the entire system or to allow for a breakout of the cable and  will be posted on or about June 1, 2006.  A secret security  clearance is required for this effort.  Point of contact for  this requirement is Mr. William D. Tenz, AMSTA-AQ-APH, Bldg.  9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

It does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the  future.   Responses to this notice shall not be construed as offers and cannot  be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The U.S. Government  will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to  this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at  the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI will not preclude  participation in any future RFP if issued. Release of reference technical documentation is limited to United States  corporations and United States citizens.    2.0  Background The Department of Defense established the JTRS program to provide a family of  software programmable radios based on the Software Communications Architecture  (SCA).  As such, the JTRS will provide reliable secure multi-channel voice,  data, imagery, and video communications and eliminate communications problems  caused by stovepipe legacy systems.  The JTRS will achieve these objectives  through the procurement and fielding of a digital, programmable, modular  communication system based on software-defined radio technology. JTRS will provide interoperability through the capacity to communicate with  current tactical communications systems in the near term.  In the future, JTRS  will provide integrated information sharing through new waveforms to support  joint operations.  This interoperability will help meet the demands of U.S.  Military forces and Joint/Coalition allies. As part of this waveform initiative, the JTRS program is evaluating the means by  which they can establish a transformational UHF-based satellite communications  capability within the JTRS family of communications products.  This RFI solicits  industrys views on the state of UHF satellite radio technologies and uses,  insights into methodologies for developing a JTRS IW capability that will be  interoperable with current and projected DoD UHF satellite radio communications,  and comments on issues that could affect the affordability, reliability, and  maintainability of the JTRS IW waveform.  3.0  Requested Information This RFI requests information from industry regarding the JTRS IW waveform  requirements as well as information regarding possib le acquisition strategies  (i.e., phasing plans, characteristic groupings, etc.).  The questions below  provide a starting point for information input. 3.1  Identification of current possible solutions: Are there any existing technologies that could satisfy the JTRS IW waveform  requirements?  Please quantify and explain any required modifications where  possible.   3.2  Technology Information: 3.2.1  Based on the requirements of the related MIL-STANDARD documents, which  requirement(s) will be the primary cost and schedule drivers in the development  of the IW waveform?   3.2.2 Are there specified modes in the MIL-STANDARDs that are not operationally  used today? 3.3  Programmatic Information 3.3.1  What acquisition strategies may be available that could reduce  implementation technical, schedule, and/or cost risk? 3.3.2  What strategies may be available that could support post-production  software support for the IW waveform? 4.0  Technical References. 4.1  SCA:  Electronic copies of the Software Communications Architecture  (Version 2.2.2) may be requested thru the JTRS JWPO.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Mammal Laboratory intends to procure on a sole source basis with North Pacific Wildlife Consulting, LLC located in Anchorage, Alaska to conduct photo-id and biopsy of Humpback Whales and other cetaceans in the waters of the Russan Far East during the period June through December 2006.

Background and objectives. 

Management of marine mammal populations falls within the jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 and, for some species, under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973.  The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction, and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery, and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  In the northeastern U.S., the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is responsible for overseeing and partially funding research on marine mammals, notably those populations listed as Strategic Stocks.
   Little is known about the distribution, abundance and population structure of humpback whales in the western North Pacific, notably in the waters of the Russian Far East (the Kurils, Kamchatka, the Commander Islands and the Chukotka Peninsula).  The collection of individual identification photographs and biopsy samples from humpback whales would provide valuable information from this geographical region.  The comparison of photographs of individual whales against existing photographic catalogues in the North Pacific would provide valuable insights into the movements/ranges of these animals.  In particular, comparison to the huge collection from the ocean-basin-wide collaborative study known as SPLASH is expected to clarify migratory destinations and other issues relating to population structure for the Russian whales.
   The work described here consists of a cost-efficient “piggyback” project which will allow collection of photos and samples from humpback whales and other cetaceans during existing Steller sea lion surveys, as well as a dedicated study of humpback whales off the Chukotka Peninsula.

Objectives. 

The main objectives of the project are:

1. Obtain individual identification photographs and biopsy samples of humpback whales from selected waters of the Russian Far East;

2. Obtain similar materials and data from other cetacean species, as practicable.


Work Breakdown Structure. 

Kurils/Kamchatka/Commanders. 

The Contractor shall supply all the necessary equipment and staff for the project.  The schedule for this portion of the work will be as follows:

June 2006:  Deploy field camps to Kuril Islands and Medny Island (Commanders).  Observers will be placed on five Steller sea lion rookeries located on Medny, Antsiferov, Lovushki, Raykoke, and Brat Chrpoev Islands.

June 20-30, 2006: A vessel survey of Steller sea lion rookeries and haulouts will be conducted along the eastern coast of Kamchatka, the western Bering Sea, and the Commander Islands.

July 1- 20, 2006: A vessel survey of Steller sea lion rookeries will be conducted in the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, and the vessel will pick up the observers from four rookeries in the Kuril Islands placed in May.

As practicable in all of this work, humpback whales and other cetaceans will be photographed and biopsy sampled, and basic sighting information on all cetaceans will be recorded.  Directed small-boat work will be conducted on humpback whales from the field camp on Medny Island.

This project requires Russian nationals to conduct the work, since it is impossible for foreigners to obtain the necessary permits.  In addition, because interaction and logistical coordination with local people is required, fluent Russian speakers are essential in this project. This work allows for cost-efficient piggy-backing onto an existing study, and the two projects will result in invaluable data from an unknown region at relatively little cost.
This notice may represent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement, incorporating all previous modifications, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following changes:  (a) update the funding opportunity description, including revisions to: (1) technical focus area for the submission of white papers in FY07, (2) white paper submission instructions, (3) evaluation criteria, and (4) anticipated award information for FY07.  All other information remains the same.

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. James R. Milligan, AFRL/IFSE, telephone: (315) 330-1491, email: James.Milligan@rl.af.mil. Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. 

The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for application demonstrations of information transformation technologies, including (but not limited to) fuselet technology. Information transformation can be defined as a facet of information management that involves the processing of elementary forms of information into rich interoperable decision making knowledge structures for human, enterprise, and machine learning and growth.  Specific information about fuselet technology can be found at http://www.fuselet.org, but essentially fuselets are managed, light-weight, reusable software components that publish value-added information through the manipulation of existing data.  Added value is defined as either providing operators access to decision quality information or overall system capabilities that they never had before, or providing more flexible and/or affordable machine-to-machine interoperability than an existing interface governed by a rigid and costly Interface Control Document (ICD); or both.  

Applications of information transformation technologies are sought which demonstrate net-centric solutions to United States Air Force (USAF) interoperability and warfighter decision making impediments in the context of joint and combined military operations.  The objectives of this BAA in FY07 are to design, develop and demonstrate controlled execution of software components (e.g., fuselets) that utilize one or more managed information spaces, or Community of Interest (COI) Infospheres (COIIs), to improve warfighter effectiveness through the provisioning of decision quality information that is facilitated by the cross-domain information exchange, human understanding, and application interoperability afforded by information transformation software components.  

Military application domains of particular interest include Command, Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) operations and systems. Offorers should describe the conceptual net-centric advancements over current military operational processes as a result of the proposed application of information transformation software components and execution environment. 

Final demonstrations are expected to be conducted at one or more Government facilities. Strongest consideration will be given to those offerors clearly indicating coordination with an end user, especially concerning specific information transformation solutions with respect to end user interoperability and decision making impediments. The goal should be to deliver a demonstration of the technology to the end user.  Offerors should be positioned to provide integration support among the specified military systems and domains to achieve the stated objectives. As part of any awarded effort, the Contractor shall identify and document of transition opportunities and strategies for information transformation services to meet warfighter needs, and describe approaches that balance the co-evolution of current military tactics, techniques, and procedures and systems of record in a manner that addresses critical accreditation, common operating environment, security, survivability, system administration, long-term maintenance and other issues that historically plague designers of to-be-fielded systems.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit a white paper no longer than ten (10) pages in length.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission. 

All responses to this announcement must either be electronically mailed to James.Milligan@rl.af.mil and reference BAA-03-08-IFKA in the subject line. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. To be considered for potential awards in FY07, white papers must be received before the end of 15 Jun 2006.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited. 

Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. 

The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: 

(1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the innovation of the proposed technology, the technical approach, and the operational relevance of the demonstration to address current and future Air Force net-centric interoperability requirements and technology transition objectives,
(2) Related Experience -- The extent to which the offeror demonstrates intellect, technical expertise, and domain knowledge,
(3) Openness/Maturity of Solution – The extent to which existing capabilities and open system standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and
(4) Best Value -- Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).

Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered. 

Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions. 

Anticipated contract awards beginning in FY07 are expected to be 12 months in duration and to range from $250K to $750K. The total cumulative dollar value of all awards will not exceed $4.9M under this BAA.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned. 

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Foreign allied participation is excluded at the prime contractor level. 

Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Lori Smith, telephone (315) 330-1955 or e-mail Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition. A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Aug 2005, may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.doc. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. 

This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 2007.

DESC:  The National Institutes of Health is doing a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of:

•	Hubzone 
•	Service-disabled veteran owned 
•	8(a) and
•	small businesses. 

The NIH would like to also determine of the below required services are commercially available. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a large biomedical research facility with approximately 2500 radioactive materials laboratories and a 350-bed research hospital. The NIH is licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to use a wide variety and appreciable quantities of radioactive materials in biomedical research and medical diagnosis and treatment.  The NIH is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of businesses interested in helping NIH ensure compliance with regulations and policies governing the use of radioactive materials and radiation-producing equipment for biomedical research.   

The majority of the radioactive material laboratories and equipment are located in Bethesda, MD; however, some are located at other licensed locations in Gaithersburg, MD, Rockville, MD, Kensington, MD, Poolesville, MD, Frederick, MD, and Baltimore, MD.  In addition to routine radioactive materials laboratories, NIH has a number of special-use laboratories in the Nuclear Medicine and PET Departments, in the Building 21 hot lab facility, and in the cyclotron facility.  

The purpose of this procurement is to contract for qualified technical assistance to be provided to assist NIH in ensuring compliance with pertinent regulations and policies.
The scope of the work is in the following areas:
&#61507;	About 5000 comprehensive (24 radiation safety compliance items to be evaluated) surveys per year

&#61507;	Monthly surveys of about 250 labs

&#61507;	Bi-monthly checks on security of radioactive materials based on a computer-generated list that specifies areas to be checked weekdays, some to be checked weekday evenings (between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.), and some to be checked on weekends.

&#61507;	Inspection of radiation-producing equipment (about 15 radiographic units, 15 fluoroscopic units, 5 bone densitometers, 15 dental radiographic units, 20 cabinet x-ray units, 6 x-ray diffraction units; 25 electron microscopes, 6 CT scanners) 
&#61507;	MARSSIM type final status surveys: the time frame for completing final status surveys (approximately 2 times per year) will vary depending on the size and condition of the site and the evacuation and demolition schedules. The Contractor shall negotiate the time frame with and directly bill the NIH representative coordinating the decommissioning of that particular facility.
	
		&#61507;	Monitoring and decontamination of personnel and areas: weekdays between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., the Contractor shall deploy a Surveyor for emergency response to the area designated by the NIH Project Officer or DRS emergency responder within 30 minutes (1 hour for satellite facilities) of notification.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide to the Project Officer a list of qualified personnel who can be contacted for after-hours emergency (monitoring/decontamination) assistance.  After-hours, the Contractor shall deploy a Surveyor to the area designated by the NIH Project Officer or Designated Alternate within 1 hour of notification.
&#61507;	Preparation and decontamination of I-131 therapy rooms: Complete decontamination of the I-131 therapy room for release as an unrestricted area typically takes 16 person-hours.  Ordinarily decontamination can be completed over 2 or 3 days.  However, it shall be completed within 1 work day if directed by the Project Officer. Complete decontamination is required approximately four times per year.  Decontamination/preparation of the I-131 therapy room between I-131 therapy patients is required approximately 30 times per year and needs to be completed within 1 work day of notification.

&#61507;	Annual field calibration of about 2000 survey meters, e.g., GM, NaI, and ZnS used for contamination monitoring

	&#61507;	Annual calibration of about 40 instruments used to measure exposure or dose equivalent rates. Most of these instruments can be taken off-site for calibration. However, a few are non-portable instruments, e.g., wall-mounted alarms that must be calibrated on-site.

&#61507;	The Contractor shall provide daily administrative support, e.g., data entry on NIH-provided database, photocopying, filing, scheduling, and preparing memos and reports.  
&#61507;	The Contractor shall provide a full-time on-site Project Manager to oversee work performed under the contract and respond to requests from the Project Officer or Designated Alternate.
&#61507;	All swipes from comprehensive and monthly surveys shall be analyzed for beta and gamma emissions at an off-site, Contractor-provided laboratory licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State.  Swipes from certain areas shall be analyzed for alphas as well.  Results must be available so that the survey reports are submitted by noon of the second day following the survey.

12.	DESCRIPTION: 
This is a request from the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SY) for Statements of Capability (SOCs) from industry to identify companies who are interested and qualified to participate in a late FY06 Research and Development contract to procure a Counter Communications System (CCS) signal processing capability enhancement, the “Counter Space Pod (CSP).”  The intent is to release a cost type contract for the operational procurement of four CSPs.  The Government will pursue a Pre KDP-C development effort with the intent of procuring a commercial off the shelf (COTS) based, state of the art, hardware and software solution that is capable of hosting previously developed and validated mission area capabilities.  The contractor will be expected to provide the 1st unit, to include logistics documentation, ready for developmental test to the government within a very short design period of approximately 12 months.  The Government intends to award this development effort to 1 contractor.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort is tentatively scheduled to be released on or around 26 June 2006.  Small business is encouraged to participate.  The applicable NAICS code for this sources-sought synopsis is 335999 with a size standard of 500 employees.  All interested parties must be cleared to handle government information and equipment up to, and including, Top Secret – SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret – SCI accredited SCIF to build and test this effort in.

All interested parties are requested to submit a written SOC no later than 3:00 p.m. PDT, 23 May 2006.  All responders must indicate whether they are a large or small business.  An Industry Day is scheduled to be held on or about 14 June 2006.  Interested parties, meeting security requirements, will be invited to attend the Industry Days to discuss requirements and contract strategy.  All contractors will be limited initially to 4-6 persons, one of whom has to be a security professional.  Each contractor will submit a SF86 for each person along with proof of a current TS/SCI access.  SCI obtained via other agencies will be accepted.  If a contractor has personnel currently accessed to an Air Force SAP and the TS/SSBI is current, then a blank Personnel Access Request (PAR) will suffice. Contractors who wish to participate must contact Mr. Gerald Crafton, GG13, via email at gerald.crafton@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 416-1591 to determine facility requirements and processes to obtain certification/accreditation of facilities and networks.  Each contractor desiring to participate in the industry day is reminded of the urgency regarding submission of personnel access information.  Persons not approved for access by 24 May will not be authorized to attend. 

CSP BACKGROUND:  Capability enhancements are being developed for CCS in the offensive counter space (OCS) mission area.  The CCS CSP enhancement will have the primary priority of delivering a “state of the art” hardware and software signal processing solution to integrate into the CCS system.  The CCS CSP enhancement will have the secondary priority of incorporating a hardware design/architecture that is scalable and flexible to facilitate the addition of greater CSP capability.  The government intends to operationally deliver the CSP in second quarter FY08, thus, leveraging information gained from past technology efforts and from other applicable mission areas will be looked upon favorably.  

Please ensure that the following format requirements are met:

Microsoft Word file format
10 pages maximum (8.5”x11”) 
1-page security management appendix
10-point typeface minimum (single-spaced)
1” margin minimum (top, bottom, left, and right)
Nested spreadsheets, images, tables, etc are permitted, but must still comply with minimum type and margin requirements.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR XM-326 SUPPORT The Marine corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying the engineering and testing support services in support of the XM 326 Actuator System development identified herein that may be procured in the near future. This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. Information on capable sources are sought for the follow requirements:  1.0	SCOPE.  This Statement of Work (SOW) delineates the tasks to be performed to support the continued engineering testing support of the XM-326 Dragon Fire II (DF II) to refine and prepare the system to achieve full functionality for all charges, all directions in a tactical environment. General Dynamics-Ordnance and Tactical System (GD-OTS) is the designer and fabricator of the experimental electric actuator system for the XM-326. The XM-326 is being tested as a dedicated counterfire response system for the United States Army Counter-Rockets, Artillery, and Mortars (C-RAM) system and this testing must be completed as soon as possible to make the XM-326 available for force protection.  2.0	BACKGROUND.  The 120 millimeter XM-326 DF II is being developed as a concept demonstrator system to explore the benefits of advanced technology for indirect fire systems. Based on the seven years’ of experimentation with Dragon Fire I, certain new technologies were shown to improve precision and responsiveness of artillery systems; however, a new system had to be designed to encompass the operational “lessons learned” from the first design.  As an example of this, the weight of the Mobile Fire Support System (MFSS) was 6,900 pounds and has proven to be too heavy to safely tow behind the High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV).  The new weapon is completed and based on its design capabilities for very fast response and high precision, it is being tested as a potential dedicated counterfire system for the Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) system and to serve as an advanced technology counterfire system in combat. 3.0 CONTRACTOR SUPPORT.  The XM-326 requires the support of engineers and technicians to support, prepare and maintain the XM-326 during the safety and engineering tests being conducted at Yuma Proving Ground AZ during June 2006. 3.1	Provide engineering support for the electric actuator system of the XM-326 during engineering and safety testing. 3.1.1	Test and prepare the XM-326 electric actuator systems at a site to be determined prior to the firing tests at Yuma Proving Ground.

<DESC>SUBJECT: MARKET RESEARCH FOR RADAR TRANSMITTER MODULATOR SWITCH REPLACEMENT 

DESC: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of the High Energy semiconductor switch used in the Line Modulator circuitry of the transmitter within the NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The switch, when triggered to the “On” state, discharges the Pulse Forming Network within the modulator which has previously been charged to 5200 Volts maximum. The large current which results brings a Klystron into conduction. The existing switch is made with Reverse Biased Diode Thyristors (RBDT’s) which are becoming obsolete. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from radar hardware manufacturers relating to the availability of suitable high energy semiconductor switches in the commercial market.
     
    The following are the salient characteristics of the existing 
RBDT switches: Ten each RBDT’s are stacked in series with suitable compression clamp hardware. Each switch has a minimum forward biased holdoff voltage of 1100 volts giving the entire stack a hold off voltage of 11000 volts minimum. The normal forward biased stack voltage is 5200 volts maximum with an over voltage protection threshold of 5600 volts nominal. Provisions are made for proper operation with one RBDT shorted accompanied by the setting of a “Maintenance Required” alarm which alerts the operator of the problem. Due to the stringent availability requirements (96%) and unmanned nature of the NEXRAD transmitter, this feature is essential, especially in storm season.  The Modulator is designed to operate with a maximum duty cycle of 0.004. The Modulator is capable of operation in two modes: Short pulse (1304 pulses per second maximum with a Pulse Width of 3 usec) and Long pulse (452 pulses per sec maximum with a pulse width of 6 usec). The switch must support this operation. The peak current per pulse is 896 amps maximum during the entire pulse width. Cooling air is supplied to the Modulator. Cooling requirements of the switch shall be stated in any responses to this request. The space available for the switch assembly is approximately 8 inches X 8 inches X 8 inches.  

  The NWS will not fund the development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey should only include items that support all stated requirements in a current commercially available configuration, or a configuration that could be made fully compliant through minor modifications.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability, a statement describing any required modifications and interface requirements, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. Should the results of this market research indicate feasibility of a High Energy semiconductor switch replacement with an existing commercial product; the NWS will consider retrofit options for its nationwide network of 175 RDAs as a potential follow-on product improvement project.  All information should be submitted to the following: Rhonda Nelson, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/MRAD, Acquisition Division, 325 Broadway, MC3, Boulder, CO  80305.  Responses should be received no later than June 12, 2006.  No telephone calls will be accepted or returned.

Method for Freeforming Objects with Low-Binder Slurry (US Patent 6,401,795)

Technology Transfer Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed patented processes for fabricating products from fine powders such as, but not limited to, ceramic parts, particulate filters, and synthetic bone grafts.  These processes can be used to rapidly produce prototypes or manufacture parts in large quantities. 

A slurry of the material containing between 0.5 and 10 percent binder is deposited on a substrate to fabricate parts directly from fine particle powders without the use of molds.  The solid freeform fabrication technique for fine particles uses computer controlled layer-wise extrusion of colloidal slurries.  Particle sizes are typically 0.5 to 5 µm, and the slurry solids content ranges between 50 and 60 volume percent solids, depending on the particle size distribution and morphology.  The liquid carrier is usually water.  The rheology of the slurry mixture is modified with minor additions of dispersants and organic binders to form pastes with a plastic consistency suitable for extrusion.  Orifice sizes range between 200 and 2000 µm, and parts may be built at rates on the order of 1 cm3 per minute.  Materials demonstrated include Al2O3, ZrO2, Si3N4, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), W, and Ag.  Since the process is essentially binderless (less than 1% organics) parts can be dried, and completely sintered into dense, strong parts in less than 24 hours.

This method has been applied to forming a three-dimensional, biocompatible, porous scaffold structure using a solid freeform fabrication technique (referred to herein as robocasting) that can be used as a medical implant into a living organism, such as a human or other mammal using materials such as hydroxyapatite.  Imaging technology and analysis is first used to determine the three-dimensional design required for the medical implant, such as a bone implant or graft, fashioned as a three-dimensional, biocompatible scaffold structure.  The robocasting technique is used to either directly produce the three-dimensional, porous scaffold structure or to produce an over-sized three-dimensional, porous scaffold lattice which can be machined to produce the designed three-dimensional, porous scaffold structure for implantation

Sandia is making these technologies available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near term and/or future applications via licensing, including up to exclusive field of use licenses, or cooperative development agreements.  For further information, please respond by email or fax to Glenn Baird no later than June 30, 2006, at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0114, P. O.

<SUBJECT>R -- State Title V Performance Indicator and Nees Assesment
<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate - on a sole source basis -- with Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill of North Carolina.  This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Contract by Negotiation Procedures as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.  


The purpose of this acquisition is to provide for the contractor to assist the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) with the identification and compilation of national Maternal and Child Health (MCH) priorities – in an effective manner – based upon the documentation provided in the 2005 State Title V MCH Needs Assessments. 

Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina of Chapel Hill has developed such a degree of in-depth knowledge of the Title V Block Grant Program’s national practices, performance measures, reporting process, review process and grant recipients makes them unique.


The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing dynamics and influential affiliations between MCHB, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and other MCH partners, which would be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replicate.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  This would cause substantial duplication of cost, dwarfing the size of this procurement.  The MCHB would not recover this duplicated cost through competition.  Therefore, HRSA determined Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina of Chapel Hill is the only responsible source under the authority found in 41 USC 253 (c) (i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2).  


THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  It is a notification of our intent to contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   The Solicitation No. is AB133F-06-RP-0125.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 05-09.
	
Objective:  The objective of this study is to determine the individual and aggregate capacity of the longline, and pole and line fleets operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean  that fish for yellowfin, albacore, skipkack or bigeye tunas and swordfish. 

Background:  The information collected for this project / report will contribute to the deliberations of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission’s next annual meeting to be convened in Apia Samoa, the week of December 15 2006.  The issue of capacity has been the subject of several resolutions by the precursors of the WCPFC, as well as at its most recent meeting (December 2005-see attached). There are a variety of conservation and management issues that have emerged during the course of the Commission’s deliberations regarding maximum or optimal fishing vessel capacity levels in the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO).  Related to these discussions have been considerable debate and question as to what is the actual level of aggregate fishing capacity in the WCPO. These questions are in part based on the rapid growth of the highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries over the last 20 years, as well as the lack of comprehensive records on regional fishing fleets.  More recently there has some examination and understanding of the size of the region’s purse seine fleet and its capacity (some of which was supported by the Pacific Islands Regional Office ), however, there is essentially no reliable summary information for the other two major gear-types known to fish for tunas and swordfish in the WCPO. 

The lack of a vessel participation / documentation list for the Western and Central Pacific has been to some degree ameliorated with the development of vessel registries at the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), and more recently with the establishment of a record of vessels authorized to fish within the high seas area of application of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention.  Yet none of these lists are believed to be complete or provide all the information required to estimate current, much less previous, vessel inventories or capacities.  Additionally, although some vessels may appear on regional registers, many longline and pole and longline vessels operate under local or bilateral access agreements and may not appear on WCPO regional databases and be only known to national authorities, or in some cases only municipal authorities.   For example, neither the FFA nor WCPFC registers include vessels fishing solely within their own EEZ. 
 
The product of this project will be a report of a survey that will provide an estimate of WCPO longline and pole and line vessel fleet sizes.  It will work toward estimating longline and pole and line fishing capacity with its various definitions/permutations.  It will explore the considerations involved in obtaining more detailed/quantitative/technical estimates of capacity.

Work Element(s):

TASKS:  Compile list of longline and pole and line vessel fleets in the western and central Pacific 

 
The offeror shall compile available information for the current period (no further back than calendar 2004).  This shall include a breakdown by nationality of the number of distant water, foreign-flagged locally based and Pacific Island registered longline and pole and line vessels.

The offeror, shall where possible, provide physical characteristics for the large scale longline fleets (large scale being over >24 meters) and for those fleets composed of vessels below 24m,  a vessel classification system shall be provided along with the number of vessels in each vessel class.  The relevant physical information shall be provided on vessels typical for each class of
vessel identified. At a minimum all vessels over 15 meters shall be included. 

Physical parameters (e.g., length overall, hold size, gross register tons, horse power) of the vessels in each fleet or class should be provided to the degree possible.  Ideally this would be standardized or convertible metrics. The offeror shall, where possible, also compile information on physical measures that can be used as proxies for standard capacity measures B such, but not limited to, vessel hold dimensions, vessel dimensions such as gross registered tons or length (overall) and or horsepower.  Provide vessel crew size where possible.  

In the case of long line fleets previous estimates of global longline fishing capacity rely heavily on (a) various lists, many which are of dubious quality, (b) previous studies, many of which rely on other studies of unknown quality or the same dubious lists. To avoid perpetrating inaccuracies, the offeror shall critically scrutinize those lists, use industry contacts, make site visits, and ground truth the information received.

The offeror shall assemble available information from all relevant WCPFC national registries (members and cooperating non-members), and well as those from multilateral organizations such as FFA and IATTC that are in the public domain, or to which NMFS can obtain permission to summarize.  

The offeror shall assemble available information from the WCPFC record of authorized vessels.

The offeror shall assemble available information on longline and pole and line participation in the western and central Pacific from the data holdings of the Oceanic Fisheries Program of the Pacific Community for the most current complete data available. 

The offeror shall document to the degree possible longline fleets that have periodically fished in the WCPFC area (within the last 10 years)– including those relevant fleets from Asian Nations including Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.

The offeror shall identify key gaps in the available information and give the considerations involved in obtaining more detailed/quantitative/technical estimates of characteristics that affect longline and pole and line capacity. For example the offeror shall, but would not be limited to, an analysis of the costs and practicality (and benefits) of obtaining more precise (quantitative) estimates of WCPO longline and pole and line capacity.

NOAA Fisheries will request the permission or concurrence for access to the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Inter- American Tropical Tuna Commission’s Regional Registers and the WCPFC record of vessels authorized to fish prior to the initiation of work by the offeror. 

NOAA Fisheries will obtain the permission or concurrence for access to the Pacific Community’s Oceanic Fisheries Program prior to the initiation of work by the offeror.   

NOAA Fisheries will provide access to relevant data bases with information for WCPO US longline and pole and line fleets.    

 
Deliverable(s):  The final work product will be a comprehensive report, addressing all Task(s) detailed items above, as well as any others that the contractor believes are relevant.

The Report:  An agreed upon electronic version of a draft report will be submitted to the COTR for review 90 days after the date of award of the contract.  The report will be reviewed by the COTR and returned with written comments or suggested revisions to the contractor within 21 days.

The final draft report addressing the COTR comments shall be submitted 30 days thereafter. 

The final report shall be submitted in both hard copy and electronic form (MSWord).  
The final report should include such visual aids as are appropriate to illustrate the findings, i.e. maps, figures, tables.

The final report shall include endnotes referencing the documents consulted and the people interviewed.
Timetable:
Day x Contract begins
Day 90 - Interim Report Due.  
Day 141- Final Report Due.
Award should run no longer than 5 months.

The personal protective equipment shall remain the property of the Contractor.
8.  PRE-ABATEMENT MEETING:  Prior to beginning work, the Contractor, the asbestos supervisor, shall meet to discuss in detail the asbestos plan, including work procedures and safety precautions.
9.  WORK PROCEDURES DURING ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES:  Perform asbestos – related work in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.1101 for Class 1, II, and III asbestos work, and as specified herein. Use wet removal procedures.  Additional Asbestos Control Area Requirements: The construction of an enclosed asbestos regulated area is impractical for the removal of ACM located on roof. Provide a ground level roped-off perimeter 40-feet larger in diameter than the area where the asbestos handling procedures are performed and provide an 8-feet tall vision barrier at roof level around the actual perimeter of the work area. Also, maintain other requirements for asbestos regulated areas. Conduct personal and area monitoring of airborne asbestos fibers during the work shift at the designated limits downwind of the asbestos work area at a frequency recommended by the industrial hygienist, but not less than once every 4-hours. If the quantity of airborne asbestos fibers monitored at the designated limits at any time is greater than or equal to 0.1 fibers (longer than 5-micrometers) per cubic centimeter of air, stop work, correct the condition(s) causing the increase, and notify the Government representative immediately. If adjacent areas are contaminated, clean the contaminated areas, monitor, and visually inspect the areas as specified herein.
10.  ASBESTOS HANDLING PROCEDURES: 
10.1.  General Procedures:  Wet asbestos material with a fine spray of amended water, other approved wetting agent, or a removal encapsulant during removal, cutting, or other handling to reduce the emission of airborne fibers. Remove material and immediately place in sealed impermeable bags constructed of 6-mil plastic sheets. Where unusual circumstances prohibit the use of sealed impermeable bags, the industrial hygienist shall submit for approval, in the asbestos plan, an alternate proposal for removal of asbestos materials and containment of asbestos fibers. All removed asbestos shall be sealed in containers which can be loaded and unloaded from a truck by hand without damage.
10.2.  Monitoring: Monitoring of airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers shall be in accordance with 29 CFR 1926.1101, and as specified herein. Air monitoring, testing, and reporting shall be performed by a Certified laboratory. The Government will have the option to perform independent monitoring.
10.3.  Monitoring Results: Fiber counting shall be completed and results reviewed by the independent industrial hygienist within 16-hours.
10.4.  Site Inspection: While performing asbestos removal work, the Contractor shall be subject to on site inspections by the Government representative, who may be assisted by safety, health, or environmental personnel. If the work is in violation of specification and drawing requirements, the Government representative will issue a stop work order to be in effect immediately and until the violation is resolved. Standby time and expense required to resolve the violation shall be at the Contractor's expense. 
11.  CLEANUP AND DISPOSAL:
11.1.  Cleanup: The industrial hygienist shall certify, in writing, that the concentration of airborne asbestos in the regulated area and the waste container removal system are less than 0.01 fibers (longer than 5-micrometers) per cubic centimeter of air and that there are no visible accumulation of dust. Do not remove the asbestos regulated area enclosure (or roped-off perimeter) and warning signs prior to the Government representative's receipt of the industrial hygienist's certification. The Government representative will visually inspect the affected surfaces for residual asbestos material and accumulated dust before and after the removal of the asbestos regulated area. The Contractor shall re-clean areas showing dust or residual asbestos materials. If re-cleaning is required, monitor the asbestos airborne concentration after re-cleaning. Notify the Government representative before unrestricted entry is permitted. The Government shall have the option to perform independent monitoring to certify the areas are safe before entry is permitted.
11.2.  Removal of Asbestos Waste Containers: Asbestos waste containers shall not be removed through the change rooms. The waste containers removal system shall consist of a wash-down station inside the asbestos regulated area, a washroom, and a waste container holding
regulated areas. The waste container removal systems shall be a temporary unit constructed to prevent the escape of asbestos fibers from the area. The system shall be physically attached to the asbestos regulated area. Personnel entering the waste container removal system shall wear personal protective equipment. The system shall not be used to enter or exit the work site. Access to outside the waste container removal system shall be sealed except during the removal of asbestos waste containers. Perform cleanup of the waste container removal system as specified herein for enclosed asbestos regulated areas. Do not remove the waste container removal system enclosure and warning signs prior to the Government representative's receipt of the industrial hygienist's cleanup certification.
11.3.  Disposal of Asbestos: Once the bags of asbestos containing materials have been removed from the work area, they shall be loaded into an enclosed truck for transportation to a state and federal approved landfill. Waste containers shall be placed on the ground at the disposal site, not pushed or thrown out of enclosed trucks. Procedures for hauling and disposal shall comply with 40 CFR 61, Subpart M, and state standards. Damaged bags shall remain in the covered vehicle and re-bagged prior to removing from the covered vehicle.  Workers unloading sealed bags shall wear appropriate respirators and personnel protective equipment when handling asbestos materials at the disposal site as directed by the Certified asbestos supervisor.

12.  Required Hazardous Material Specification (OCT 2001)

12.1  In accordance with Air Force Instruction 32-7086 and Holloman AFB Instruction 32-11, ALL material determined to be hazardous as defined by Federal Standard 313, Paragraph 3.2, must be authorized for use via the AF Form 3952 approval process.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT:
1.0	**OVERVIEW: ** This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the tasks required to develop and certify a modernized replacement for the current AC system for the HU-25 fleet of aircraft. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has in service three types of HU-25 aircraft, they are the HU-25 A, C and D.  The primary Alternating Current power source for these aircraft is the 20 KVA AC generator.  The hydraulically driven 20 KVA generator provides 115 VAC; three phase 400 cycles to the main AC bus.  The current electrical system (for mission avionics) experiences numerous failures, low Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), requires extensive maintenance, and includes components that are obsolete and unserviceable.  The Constant Speed Drive (CSD) system components have become some of the most significant mission readiness degraders on the airframe.  Failures of the Constant Speed Motor (CSM) and AC generator are expensive and result in the HU-25 being out of commission while the units are located and replaced.  A modern AC power Generation system will enhance HU-25 mission readiness and reduce life cycle costs. The CSD system consists of three primary components: The two engine driven hydraulic pumps, the constant speed drive Motor (CSM) and the main AC generator.  The CSM, AC generator, hydraulic plumbing, and wiring are located in the aft compartment of the aircraft.  The total weight of the system located in the aft compartment is approximately 150 lbs, this estimate takes in consideration all equipment, wiring, hydraulic tubing and fluids.  The current center of gravity of the aircraft is critical and reduction in weight of the system is desirable.

2.0	  **SCOPE: ** The USCG is seeking a System to replace the current CSD system which generates alternating current (AC) electrical power on its fleet of HU-25 aircraft.  A “Commercial-Off-The Shelf” (COTS) System is desired.  The prospective contractor shall be a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center having the engineering, analysis, development certifications, and integration expertise to provide the services required.  The design shall specify all industry recognized standards for equipment and hardware which will be incorporated into each aircraft to generate clean, safe MIL-STD-704F AC electrical power.  The USCG estimates that 12KVA, 400 cycles, three-phases is the minimum power requirement.  The prospective contractor shall perform a baseline load analysis to confirm the USCG’s 12 KVA, 400 cycle, three-phase loads requirement.  The quote shall include a complete description of the proposed system, associated drawings, schematics, and manuals required for installation and maintenance.  Quotes must specify MTBF of the equipment. Copies of relevant documentation shall accompany the System package. Award will be based on a solid technical quote, past performance, and Firm Fixed Price.

Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While Factor 3-Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price factors (1 and 2) are significantly more important than the price factor.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-851); 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606; Washington, D. C. 20593; Telephone (202) 267-2285; Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-807, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339112 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), requires a vendor to build and commission three respiratory chambers that will be located in the Hatfield Clinical Research Center at NIH. 

These respiratory chambers are critical to the conduct of research in the area of obesity and are used to determine the metabolic rate of research subjects.  In contrast to conventional respiratory chambers, requirements for the three NIH respiratory chambers include:

 1) Size large enough to accommodate obese subjects up to 600 lbs;
2) Modifications to allow procurement of research samples during the 24 hour metabolic studies;
3) Integration of all components to assure high sensitivity and high-resolution data acquisition so that metabolic changes can be assessed rapidly;
4) Take no more than 18 months to set up, integrate and commission three chambers.

The vendor will assure that the necessary materials and equipment including high-precision sensors, high-end gas– sampling and conditioning devices and high-resolution data-acquisition hardware are used according to design.  The vendor will set-up, mount, and integrate all chamber hardware components, sensors, plumbing, and accessories according to design.  The vendor will integrate all sensors (pressure, temperature, humidity, activity and flow) to the data acquisition board and verify accuracy of the data.  The vendor will perform zero and span calibration, and quantify noise level on oxygen and carbon dioxide analyzers.  The vendor will design the gas sampling configuration and customize the analysis software to achieve proper noise suppression for rapid resolution of metabolic changes.  The vendor will determine the accuracy of the chamber using a series of propane burns and varying noise suppression windows down to 15 minute while keeping error to 2% or less.  Optimization of the noise suppression window and validation of the time resolution of the chamber must be performed by injecting mixed gas (20% CO2, 80%N2) for various intervals.  Chamber measurements need to be conducted on human volunteers to measure resting energy expenditure and metabolic changes with exercise.  The vendor will work with investigators at the NIH to conduct 24 hour chamber measurement in 10 human volunteers for reproducibility of 24 hour energy expenditure, 24 hour respiratory quotient, and short term energy expenditure and respiratory quotient.  The vendor will provide NIH investigators with an operating manual, and on-site training for staff.  The vendor must supply sufficient warranty for labor and technical support for a period of 6 months after completion to assure proper functioning of the chambers.  Each chamber measures about 11’ 7” x 12’ 6-1/2” which is approximately a total of 438 square feet.  These are freestanding chambers surrounded by a “buffer zone” of approximately 1-2 feet.  The rooms where the chambers are located are approximately 13’ x 14’ not including a separate area for the instrumentation that services the chambers.  

The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items with its offer.  The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercials Items, applies to this acquisition.  The addenda to the clause reads as follows:  The offeror must include in their quotations, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.  The FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items – Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions, applies to this acquisition.  The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the service specified in this synopsis should submit their quotation to the below address.  Quotations will be due fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis or May 26, 2006.  The quotation must reference “Solicitation number” NIH-NIDDK-06-807.  Quotations must be submitted in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 775, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, Attention:  Patricia Haun.  FAXED COPIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Brand Name:  Magnacide H, Salient Characteristics are:  Rapidly degrades leaving no residue, does not bind or stay in soil as a result there is no build up, reacts through hydration which decreases toxicity, kills aquatic pond weeds & algae which begins to break down within hours after application, application extends 8-10 miles (application is not labor intensive).  Brand Name or Equal Justification:  Magnacide H performs the minimum needs of the Government by killing aquatic pond weeds and algae keeping irrigation canals clear so that farmer’s fields are watered through the summer.  The following justifies the use of the above salient characteristics.  The product must rapidly degrade and leave no residue to insure that crops are not damaged and the ecology is not harmed.  The product must kill aquatic pond weeds and algae to insure that the water flow in canals is not disturbed so that irrigation customers will get the water needed for crops. Maintaining clear canals is especially important when water levels are lower toward the end of the summer and drought years.  The application needs to extend 8-10 miles because efficiencies are improved by reducing man hours in the application process and over all cost of application and materials needed.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6027. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 dated 4/19/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 2(two) lots of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be approximately 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of it’s kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  This is an 40(forty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) Lots of RML custom gene chips, at ~45 chips per lot.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

16.Operators will be able to enter all valid DCN data through a keyboard or touch screen.

17.Equipment must feed and number documents correctly 99% of the time.

18.Sequential Number:  This is the only number that will change from document to document within a given block.  Blocks will consist of 500 documents or less.  The first document of the first Block will always have a value of 00001 except for CTRs.  The first CTR document will be 60001.  For each subsequent document in this block, this value will increase by one.

   A] A Block consists of 500 or less individual documents for a 
   single document type.  Numbering may be the same for Blocks 
   processed on the same day for different form types.  
   For example, the first SAR processed may be numbered:     
   200606700001; and the first MSB SAR processed may also be
   numbered 200606700001.  The first CTR processed on the same  
   day would be numbered 200606760001.  

   B] When the number of documents [500] for a block has been 
   reached, the operator will be queried if they want to start a 
   new block with the same year and Julian Date.  If yes, the 
   numbering machine will start a new block with the Sequential 
   Number set at 501.  If no, the machine will wait for further   
   instructions.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6027. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09 dated 4/19/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 2(two) lots of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be approximately 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of it’s kind exists. These gene chips are a one-time-use-only consumable and will be consumed in RML experiments.  This is an 40(forty) day, one time work effort, where the final product will be 2(two) Lots of RML custom gene chips, at ~45 chips per lot.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section.

<CONTACT>Frank.Flutter@va.gov
<DESC>1.	Question: What steps, if any, will the VA take to ensure that affiliated firms do not obtain more than one contract award under this procurement? Answer: The representations and certifications clause incorporated into the solicitation (FAR 52.212-3) requires the quoter to reveal if it is owned by a common parent.  In addition the solicitation states: "The Government shall make only one award to any quoter." This should be understood to mean that the Government will award only one contract to one company inclusive of any affiliates in any category. An affiliate is defined in FAR 19.101. The Government may require signed statements or certifications from prospective awardees regarding this matter prior to award. 2.	Question: A contradiction exists regarding the weight of the Duck cloth used for the Header. Page one states, Weight, Ounces per square yard (Minimum) for the Duck to be 8.5. Paragraph 2.1.5 states the weight shall be between 7 ounces and 8.25 ounces. Current and previous requirements for the Duck cloth is 8.25 ounces minimum. Please confirm that Duck cloth conforming to 8.25 minimum ounces per square yards remains acceptable. Answer: Yes, it is acceptable. 3.	Question: Regarding the looper thread, the specification used prior to the commercial item description (416E) calls for the looper thread on the white portion of Flag. The current commercial item description, as modified, requires the looper thread to be on the red and white portion of the flag.  Please clarify.   	Answer: The commercial item description is modified such that the looper thread must be on the white portion of the interment flag. 4.	Question: Regarding the fly hem, the specification used prior to the commercial item description (416E) calls for the Fly hem to be sewn using EFB-4. The current commercial item description, as modified, does not specify and implies that 2 needle machine should be used. Answer: A two needle machine may be used. 5. Question: Please confirm the number of Amendments. There appear to be seven amendments to the combined synopsis/solicitation. Answer: As stated in previous answers to questions, the Department of Veterans Affairs automated procurement system is not completely compatible with FBO and treats multiple documents as additional amendments and numbers them accordingly.  When the FBO posting for the interment flag Request For Quote is opened, one will see (including this one) eight amendments and the combined synopsis/solicitation itself.  They are numbered at the top of the page from one to eight. Search under archived documents for the February 23, 2006 posting.
