<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item identified below, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number 14-3k47-03, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-12. The NAICS code is 334516, with a small business standard of 500 employees.  The Government intends to negotiate non-competitively with MACS , Dr. William McClure, North Carolina University Raleigh, North Carolina 27695-7625, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253© (1) when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by  one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy the agency requirement. The Portable NIR meter (PNIRM) System and components are sole source because no other companies have been located that build instruments of this type that are filter based, near-infrared covering a range up to 2500 nm of this size.  The MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS for the PNIRM are as follows: develop a portable NIR meter (PNIRM) for determining nitrogen levels in manure samples.  The PNIRM is an intermediate development leading to a small hand-held NIR meter.   This phase is needed to adapt the gap-second derivative technology for manure samples (including circuit design, wavelength selection, calibration, software embedding, and sample preparation and field evaluation). The PNIRM must be calibrated in the laboratory and have the capability to be hooked to a computer for storing calibration data for calibration.  Once the calibration is downloaded, the PNIRM may be disconnected from the computer for field operation.  The primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the Gap-second derivative technique for determining nitrogen in manure samples. The PNIRM, unlike other filter instruments, must be able to accommodate up to 10 filters permitting the calculation of a minimum of three calibration gap-second derivatives.  The potential exists for additional gap-second derivatives depending on the sensitivity of wavelength information.  The PNIRM must be able to utilize an evacuated and cooled lead sulfide (PbS) and be able to operate in the reflection mode.  Selection of wavelengths (filters) for the instrument will be based on analysis of spectra already acquired by the Animal Manure and By-Products Laboratory of USDA.  Circuitry is needed to determine the filter positions, read each filter and store the intensity data to be used in calculating the gap-second derivatives. The PNIRM requires both interface and embedded software to operate in the “calibration” (CM) and “stand alone” (SAM) modes. In the CM, the PNIRM must be able to be connected to a computer for uploading data and downloading calibrations.  This must be accommodated via. RS232 protocol.  Once the calibration equation is downloaded, the PNIRM must be able to determine and store the nitrogen content of manure samples, operating independently of the computer. It must have the capability to store up to 107 manure samples for calibrating and testing.  The total data set will need to be divided as follows: 107 samples for calibration and additional samples will be acquired for validation.  Performance of the meter must be reported in terms of the standard error of calibration (SEC), standard error of validation (SEV), coefficient of variability (CV) and bias.  The delivery is FOB destination (including inside delivery) to Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland.  Delivery is required one year after award.  This solicitation incorporates the following FAR clauses, provisions, and addendums: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items; and 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination.

(b) An offeror who checks “has not” may not be awarded a contract until the required report is filed.  Section 508 Accessibility Compliance Clause: All Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) procured through this contract must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.  Viewable at http:www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm-PART 1194.

<DESC>The RESULTS National Contracting Service expects to give vendors an opportunity to qualify for inclusion in the RESULTS Qualified Vendors List (QVL) by reopening the QVL during the summer of 2003.  Reopening our QVL accomplishes several things including: Increase and improve opportunities for qualified vendors to do business with the Government. Bring additional capabilities to FAA and other Government Program Managers to better satisfy their complex requirements. Make incidental but important administrative updates to Basic Ordering Agreement language. While the RESULTS national Contracting Service cannot specify QVL reopening dates at this time, we expect to use this site to notify vendors and others of QVL reopening status changes.  Interested vendors should periodically view this site for the latest news.  Phone inquiries to the RESULTS office about the QVL reopening will be directed to this site, and therefore, are discouraged at this time.

<SOLNBR>71930
<RESPDATE>051903
<ARCHDATE>04242004
<CONTACT>Anna M. Brown Contract Specialist 7037871369     Anna.Brown@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), intends to competitively award a contract entitled "Update of Select Environmental Information for Norton Basin, Chukchi/Hope Basin, and Cook Inlet Planning Areas" for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be eighteen (18) months with an estimated cost range of $130,000 to $147,500.  Background:  In the Final Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2002-2007, (July 2002), the MMS proposes lease sales in the Norton Basin, Chukchi/Hope Basin, and Cook Inlet Planning Area (see Figure 1).  Although a Draft Environmental Impact Statement has recently been published for Cook Inlet, it has been several years, or longer, since Environmental Impact Statements were written to describe potential developments in the other two areas. Consequently, MMS literature compilations are somewhat out of date.  Updated literature surveys would potentially benefit MMS analysts, representatives of other agencies and organizations, and the general public in efforts to conduct environmental assessment analyses for proposed Outer Continental Shelf offshore oil and gas leases in the above planning areas.  The primary goals of this study are to conduct specialized literature surveys and related annotated bibliographies of new scientific information within the past five to ten years on fish, marine mammals, marine birds, ecosystems, and human social systems that might be affected by oil and gas development on the Alaskan Outer Continental Shelf.  Statement of Work:  Task 1 - Norton Sound Protected Species Literature Update (1991-2003).  (a) Identify new literature or other available information on endangered and threatened species in the Norton Sound Region.  The contractor is requested to contact appropriate sources at the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, and/or other sources to identify new information on species status, critical habitats, and responses of sensitive species to development, and prepare related annotated bibliographic information.  The review will need to cover new information since that available for the most recent OCS Environmental Impact Statement for the area, OCS EIS/EA MMS 90-0009, Norton Sound OCS Mining Program Final Environmental Impact Statement, March 1991.  The literature survey should include new scientific information on fish, marine mammals, marine birds, ecosystems, and human social systems that might be affected by oil and gas development in the OCS.  Potential sources of information include, but are not limited to: 1. Primary scientific literature and books. 2. Unpublished reports, analyses, and other accessible documents. 3. Other sources such as internet homepages and accessible data bases. (b) Prepare an annotated ProCite or ProCite-compatible bibliography of the new scientific information obtained in Task 1(a) above.  Task 2 - Chukchi Sea and Hope Basin - Literature Update (1991-2003).  (a) Conduct a survey of new literature or other available scientific information on fish, marine mammals, marine birds, ecosystems, and human social systems that might be affected by oil and gas development in the Chukchi Sea and Hope Basin OCS.  The survey should concentrate on new information since that available for the most recent OCS Environmental Impact Statement for the area, OCS EIS/EA MMS 90-0095, Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 126 Final Environmental Impact Statement, January 1991. (b) Prepare an annotated ProCite or ProCite-compatible bibliography of the new scientific information obtained in Task 2(a) above.  Task 3 - Cook Inlet Region Fisheries Literature Update (1998-2005).  (a) Conduct a survey of new literature or other available scientific information on fisheries that might be affected by oil and gas development in the Cook Inlet OCS.  The survey should concentrate on new information since that available for OCS EIS/EA MMS 2002-065, Cook Inlet Planning Area Oil and Gas Lease Sales 191 and 199 Draft Environmental Impact Statement, December 2002.  Identify new literature or other available information on Cook Inlet-specific topics with particular emphasis on the following:  1. Geographic and seasonal distribution and abundance of fish in Cook Inlet with emphasis on identifying sources of information that can be incorporated by MMS into GIS layers for modeling effects of oil spills.  2. Geographic and water column locations of Cook Inlet salmon between smolt and returning adult.  3. Socioeconomics of commercial fishing in Cook Inlet, including relationships to offshore oil and gas development.  (b) Prepare an annotated ProCite or ProCite-compatible bibliography of the new scientific information obtained in Task 3(a) above.  Task 4 - Reporting.  For each Task, brief draft and final narrative reports of survey goals, methods, major information sources, contacts with information sources, and any problems encountered shall be prepared.  The reports shall summarize/list any expected but currently unavailable pertinent reports, journal articles or other in-press material of which the MMS Alaska OCS Region should be aware and of which the contractor has learned as part of the search.  The reports will explain any special background, features, classifications within, considerations, or limitations of annotated bibliographies prepared.  How to Respond: In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate they are qualified to perform the work by providing, not later than 4:30 PM, Monday, May 19, 2003, a Capabilities Statement describing in detail:(A)The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for 3 months of Configuration Management for the International Space Station Program.  The  3 months requirement is only an option and may or may not be exercised. The award of the option will depend upon any delays of the contracts currently being competed under the ISS Contract Strategy.  A delay in award of these contracts would result in exercising of this option. A copy of the ISS Contract Strategy may be viewed at;      http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/     NASA/JSC intends to award a 3-month extension to Johnson Engineering, under contract NAS9-00125.  The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage.  Any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by cost and time delays since it is only a short extension of 3 months.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See Note 22. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.	See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to negotiate a sole source award for Code 2732 of SPAWAR System Center San Diego to Synergy Microsystems. The contractor shall provide the following: DSP VME - Quad PPC - 7400 @ 366 Mhz p/n DSP/VSS4-QA36QS-FXPBSNA3 (quantity = 6). SSC ? SD Code 2732 has been tasked to build receiver systems for the Distant Sentinel Program (satellite receive program). Under this program SSC-SD requires a single-board Array Processor system. ( An array processor is a mini computer with four (4) processor chips integrated for greatly enhanced processing speed.) The intended use of the board is to perform signal processing, system control, and interface for the Distant Sentinel system. The board must utilize a VME64 (VERSA module Euro card) interface and provide enough processing power for highspeed DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithmic computations. SSC-SD requires an Array Processor system that consists of two SCSI interface ports, two RS-232 Serial interfaces, an Ethernet 10/100 Base-T interface, and a PCI Mezzanine interface. The Array Processor must meet the performance minimum of 3.5 GFLOPS and support the LINUX operating system. The board?s physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions. Synergy Microsystems is the only manufacturer who produces a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Array Processor board that satisfies the Distant Sentinel processing, size, and interface requirements. The VSS4VME Quad PPC 750 DSP and Array Processing board meets all the unique requirements for the Distant Sentinel Program. The VSS4 board provides four super scalar PowerPC 750 processors performing at 3.7 GFLOPS. The VSS4 board provides all of the necessary interface requirements including the VME bus interface as well as supporting the LINUX operating system. This justification warrants the use of the VSS4VME Quad PPC 750 DSP and Array Processing board. The SIC Code is 3571 and the NAICS Code is 334111. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement. Capability statements shall include evidence that the firm has previous experience in providing this requirement. Please provide the statements via e-mail only to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov and sally.savaglio@gsa.gov by May 12, 2003; 4:30 p.m. Local Pacific Time. This notice is not a solicitation nor is it a formal Request for Proposal. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In the absence of responses from firms that believe they have the capability to provide these services, GSA intends to negotiate with Synergy Microsystems, 9605 Scranton Road, Suite 700, San Diego, CA  92121.

Product specifics are the following: The sub rack assembly is a custom design which houses a card cage with three slots for 6U X 160mm VME64X cards and two removable hard drives, all accessible and removable at the front panel. The chassis assembly is of rugged design and construction to perform in a field environment and meets stringent volume requirements. The front panel has removable mounting flanges to allow a shipping volumetric envelope measuring 5 ? X 17 X 22 inches. It is equipped with an international AC voltage power supply that provides +3.3VDC, +5VDC, and ?12VDC per VME64X requirements at the required current and power levels. Cooling fans maintain sufficient airflow to allow operation in an ambient temperature of 50?C. A sensor, an audible alarm and a warning light (LED) provide indication of a high-temperature condition. These requirements dictate that the chassis have a custom design. AP Labs can fulfill the requirements of this task order are based upon the following: The supplier provided the chassis for the first generations Communication Sub rack Assembly, 0204911-1, and successfully demonstrated having the engineering capability and the manufacturing and assembly facilities to fabricate the required chassis and to provide card cages, back planes and power supplies that conform with VME64X standards. Because of basic design requirements that apply to the first and this, the second, generation, the configuration of this assembly?s chassis does not conform to any other existing commercially available design. AP Labs is the only company that has been found to have an engineering staff and complete facilities to fabricate the chassis in-house and to have VME64X back planes in the required size. The SIC Code is 3571 and the NAICS Code is 334111.

<DESC>The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIVNAVSURFWARCEN) has interest in proposals for designing, analyzing and manufacturing a coextrusion system to be used in highly solids filled polymer, 70-80 % solids fill, applications. The system will be used in Indian Head Division’s pilot scale propellant processing facility.  The system should be capable of combining melt flows from a Werner & Pfleiderer, W&P, 40-mm twin-screw extruder and from a W&P 37-mm twin-screw extruder positioned ninety degrees from each other.  The 40-mm TSE will be the extruder positioned in line with the coextrusion die.  The configuration of the coextrusion product will be an ABA type.  The A layers will come from the 37-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches and a thickness of about 0.015 inches.  The B layer will come from the 40-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches  and a thickness of about 0.080 inches.  The manufacturer should provide the transition piece that will feed the melt flows from the extruders to the coextrusion die.  Circulating water/propylene glycol mixture will provide temperature control for the coextrusion die.  The system should be capable of venting in the event that either or both extruders reach a pressure of 3,000 psi and should be designed such that no stagnation of material occurs inside the die.  The coextrusion system should also provide features to control flow, to adjust layer distributions and correct layer instabilities. It should also include die lip adjustment for overall thickness, edge trimming capability and a remote take away spooling system for product collection. The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1, Group D and Class II, Division 1, Groups E, F and G requirements.   The proposal shall include: a three-dimensional flow model analysis for the coextrusion system.  The data required from the flow analysis would be pressure distributions, shear stress, shear rates and residence time in different regions of the die.  The manufacturer should also provide graphical data of temperature, pressure, shear rate and residence time distributions in the die along with volumetric flow rate of the die. Engineering procedures for assembling, disassembling, cleaning and operating the coextrusion system should also be included as well as system oversight during an inert coextrusion run.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center will provide,  after contract award, the data required by the manufacturer for the flow analysis and three-dimension model. Offerors may submit a one-page abstract of their proposal.  Any offeror whose abstract is found t o be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal. Such an invitation does not assure subsequent contract award. Proposals may be reviewed and acted on as they arrive.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<DESC>This procurement is anticipated to be a Sole Source Contract with the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, located in Washington DC.  In the Request For Proposals (RFP) the FHWA will be seeking a proposal for work entitled: “Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program Office Program Support.” It is anticipated that the award will be an ID/IQ task order contract, and that each task order issued will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee.

The objective of this contract is to provide support services to the ITSJPO in the conduct of the ITS program as authorized under the TEA-21 (Public Law 105-178).

Congress, under The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( TEA-21, Public law 105-178), section 5201,  finds that “continue investment in architecture and standards development, research, and systems integration as necessary to accelerate the rate at which intelligent transportation system program  are incorporated into the national surface transportation  network, thereby improving transportation safety and efficiency and reducing costs and negative impacts on communities and the environment.”

In carrying out the provisions of this subtitle, section 5204 of TEA-21 mandates the  Secretary to conduct an ongoing intelligent transportation system program to research, develop, and advance nationwide deployment of such systems in cooperation with State and local governments and others, including public and private entities . 

Accordingly, The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITSJPO) has been working with Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), to support ITSJPO’s current and future responsibilities, including surface transportation management and operations, for  over 10 years through a cooperative agreement.  With the maturity of the ITS program, the ITSJPO requires the assistance of ITSA in a variety of program functions as a result of  its unique membership, access to ITS industry, and the intricate knowledge base of its staff.  This contract will provide specific services and supplies, through the issuance of  Cost Plus Fixed Fee task orders on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) basis.  

NO  PRE-PROPOSAL  CONFERENCE:  The FHWA does not plan to conduct any pre-proposal conference for prospective offerors, but see the following paragraphs, for the procedure for asking questions about this solicitation.   

NO  ORAL  PRESENTATIONS:  The FHWA has decided that the oral presentations method will not be used in this procurement.  However, any offeror whose initial proposal is found to be within the competitive range, and who does not receive an award without discussion, will be asked to participate in a negotiation session which would include an oral discussion of all technical issues and all cost-and-pricing issues pertaining to that offeror’s proposal.

<DESC>The University of California, which operates the Los Alamos National Laboratory under contract to the Department of Energy, solicits companies interested in collaborating with Los Alamos National Laboratory in a sponsored research arrangement to further develop a nuclear materials detection technology. The selected firm(s) will be required to provide funding to the collaboration which could take the form of government or company funds for the development of the technology.
* Note: This is not a procurement or grant opportunity. 

Los Alamos National Laboratory has invented a new nuclear materials detection technology for with the potential to passively detect small quantities of shielded sensitive nuclear materials quickly by using background radiation as a radiographic probe. This unique technique is highly selective to high-Z, i.e. radiographically opaque and dense materials, both special nuclear materials and gamma-ray shielding materials.  The new approach to detection is useful for quick and efficient screening of contraband nuclear weapon type materials at inspection stations such as at border crossings and ports of entry.  The technology has been laboratory tested for proof of principle and industrial partners are being sought for scale-up.

Any organization interested in entering a sponsored research agreement with Los Alamos National Laboratory to develop the technology must respond with a Letter of Interest.  The Letter of Interest shall include a description of the company’s (1) business and business goals (2) motivation for pursuing this opportunity and (3) field of use for applying the technology. Failure to provide this information may be grounds to consider your Letter of Interest as not being a qualified or acceptable response to this request. The Laboratory may exclude your company from negotiations under this condition.

The Letter of Interest must provide the information requested above in order for the respondent to be considered a qualified respondent.  The Letter of Interest is requested by COB May 16, 2003.  Following the execution of a Nondisclosure Agreement, qualified respondents will be provided with technical data that will enable them to evaluate the technology.  Qualified respondents that wish to enter into negotiations for a sponsored research agreement will be required to submit a comprehensive business plan or product plan prior to selection and negotiations. Please send Letters of Interest to the attention of Charles Gibson, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Industrial Business Development Program Office, Mail Stop C334, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545; or email them to [charliegib@lanl.gov].  Additional information may be obtained by email [charliegib@lanl.gov], phone [505-667-8087], or fax [505-667-9816].

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Prizm Advanced Communications Electronics, Inc., 6655-R Amberton DR #R, Baltimore, MD 21075, on a sole-source basis for a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Fiber-Optic telemetry system. Prizm will deliver their fiber optic multiplexer systems modified to meet the requirements of the CSS. Purchase order N61331-03-M-1321 was awarded on a sole source basis to Prizm for an identical modified system. On that order, Prizm Advanced Communication Electronics Inc. agreed that they would meet all of the project requirements or there would be no obligation on the government's part to buy the system. It would be returned to Prizm. No other COTS system had been found that came close to meeting all of the project requirements. This modified system was delivered, integrated into the CSS project, an d met all requirements imposed. Accordingly, a second unit is being procured to meet the overall CSS needs. Integration and testing of any other proposed system would require at least 10 man-weeks of effort, the cost of which could not reasonably be expected to be offset by a lower price for the basic system. Delivery of the hardware will occur within 8 weeks of award of the order. Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334511 applies. Size Standard is 750 employees.

The equipment will be required to interface with and be 100% backward compatible and easily integrated with the existing hardware and software currently in use on the LCAC system. Use of any other manufacturers equipment would co st the Government additional time and money while attempting to integrate the different systems that in turn would negatively impact delivery of the system to the fleet.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, North Central Research Station, Houghton, Michigan intends to issue sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, FAR Part 11, FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13 and as prescribed in 411.171, the following provision:  Brand Name or Equal Nov 1996, to Li-Cor Inc., 4421 Superior Street, Lincoln Nebraska, for a LI-6400P Portable Photosynthesis System.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253 (c)(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Photosynthesis system consists of: LI 6400 Portable Photosynthesis System, CO2 Injector System, Red/Blue Led Light Source, External Quantum Sensor, CO2 Cylinders 12 Grams (25 Cylinders/Package).  The package includes: LI-6400 Conifer Chamber, Soil Respiration Chamber, AC Power Supply, Quantity of 25 - 12GM CO2 Cylinders, Soda Lime Wet, Drierite Indicating 10-20, 3 Day 6400 Training.  In particular, the machine must meet the following requirements: machine must scrub CO2 out of the air prior to a soil respiration measurement so that the measurement is taken while headspace CO2 concentration passes through ambient; a soil chamber system that is pressure-vented to the atmosphere, so that placement of the chamber into soil does not result in an increase in headspace air pressure that will influence the soil respiration flux; for above ground research we are working with plants that maintain high rates of H20 exchange, and for soils research in soils that are often humid, in both, water can accumulate in the tubing of photosynthesis systems, the ideal is to minimize the length of tube between measurement chambers and analyzers.  This is a Simplified Acquisition with an estimated value of less then $33,000.  This notice is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  Information furnished shall be in writing and shall contain sufficient detail, to allow NCRS to determine if the party can meet the requirement. Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 3:00 PM Central on May 12, 2003.  If there are any questions please contact Tina Miller, Purchasing Agent Fax 651-649-5204, tinamiller@fs.fed.us, 1992 Folwell Ave. St. Paul MN  55108.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NAICS Code 334516.

BE SURE TO RESPOND TO ALL FIVE (5) CRITERIA.    Additional Sheets should be used if needed to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.

Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with three or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services.  Negotiations will occur beginning with the most preferred firm in the final selection.  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has issued a Request For Proposals for research and development efforts from industry and/or university teams for research and development of building components that are integrated with solar and other renewable energy generation technologies.  Buildings use two-thirds of all electrical energy consumed in the United States and are responsible for a considerable portion of U.S. peak electrical demand.  Because buildings are typically used for 50–100 years, their inertia has a major impact on future energy-use patterns.  Recognizing this enormous impact, the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Building Technologies Program has adopted the long-term goal of creating marketable buildings that produce all the energy that they use on an annual basis – Zero Energy Buildings.  In support of this goal, Zero Energy Buildings will use solar and other renewable energy generation technologies in combination with energy-efficient building envelopes, appliances and systems to reduce the purchased energy requirements of new buildings.  The Zero Energy Buildings strategy entails transforming the design and construction of new buildings so that they use renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies at levels consistent with building functionality, market needs, and societal concerns.  The Zero Energy Buildings concept is designed to catalyze a process that begins with the integration of both energy efficiency and renewable energy generation technologies into new construction. The process will then evolve to the construction of buildings that so successfully integrate efficiency and renewable energy generation that they have a zero-net need for off-site energy on an annual basis.  The ultimate market for the Zero Energy Buildings concept is all residential and commercial building construction in the U.S.  However, this Statement of Work (SOW) is focused on residential buildings (with potential application to small commercial buildings) and is specifically aimed at single-family homes, generically referred to as Zero Energy Homes.  Full text of the solicitation will be available on the NREL web site http://www.nrel.gov/contracts/solicitations.html on or after April 25, 2003.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00176, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13.  The  associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990 which has a small business size standard of 500 employees, however, it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded as the result of a full and open competition.  The purpose of this notice is to inform all  interested parties that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to award a Firm-fixed-price purchase order as a result of this solicitation.  Award will be made to a single contractor for all tasks.  BACKGROUND: Environmental Protection Agency, National  Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) evaluated the sources of particulate matter (PM) impacting personal exposure samples under a previous contract (# OD-5538-NAEX) with Clarkson University for a Particulate Matter Epidemiology-Exposure Study. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and Multilinear  Engine (ME) receptor models were used to identify and quantify the sources of particulate matter contributing to personal exposure.  A new ME model was developed to evaluate this relatively simple case of having all of the subjects living in a single multi-story facility.  This contract will  continue the development of receptor models for the evaluation of human exposure data.  The models will be evaluated using data from a NERL human exposure study in Research Triangle Park, Raleigh and Chapel Hill  that collected data from subjects living in separate homes.  In the RTP study, EPA  collected 24-hour integrated personal PM2.5 samples on 35 participants living in separate homes for 7 days each in each of four seasons (28 measurements per person).  Particulate matter samples were also collected inside and outside of individuals homes during the personal monitoring and at a  central community (ambient) site operated throughout the study.  Particulate matter samples were analyzed by thermal-optical carbon analysis (organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC)), and are currently being analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF).  In addition, air exchange  rates were measured daily, participants maintained a personal activity diary, gaseous pollutants were measured indoor (CO, NO2, 03), and estimates of PM2.5 are available from personal and indoor nephelometers.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The contractor shall develop receptor models to determine and quantify  the sources of PM in the NERL RTP Study samples (community, outdoor home, indoor, and personal).  In addition, the infiltration of outdoor sources to indoor shall be determined.  A combination of the PMF and the ME receptor models developed under contract OD-5538-NAEX with Clarkson University  (source profiles constraints, external and internal factors) shall be used to quantify the sources and infiltration rates.  This data may be provided to the contractor upon award.  TASKS TO BE COMPLETED: Task 1: Receptor Modeling of the RTP Study Data: Sampling Artifacts and Infiltration:  The  contractor shall develop receptor models to determine and quantify the sources of PM contributing to personal exposure in RTP Study.  Source contributions shall be reported for the community, outdoor home, indoor, and personal samples.  This receptor modeling shall be conducted with the PMF and ME  receptor models.  The contractor shall evaluate organic carbon sampling artifacts by including the organic carbon (OC) evolved in the first peak of the thermal-optical carbon analysis as an estimate of the organic carbon artifact (first peak OC (OC1) and OC - OC1, only OC - OC1).  In addition, the  contractor shall evaluate the use of air exchange rate data in the models to explain between home variability in infiltration, and indoor and personal source contribution estimates.  The contractor shall provide the PMF2 data sets and modeling results.  The contractor shall also provide the final  ME script, data sets, and modeling results.  The contractor shall prepare a report describing the results of this task.  The contractor shall provide sample source contributions, source profiles, and data sets in Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft?),  figures in Sigma Plot (SPSS), and the report in Word  (Microsoft?). OPTIONAL  Task 2: Receptor Modeling of the RTP Study Data: Activity Data:  The contractor shall continue the model development and data evaluation in Task 1 of this contract by evaluating the use of activity data in the receptor model to further explain variability in personal source  impacts (i.e. motor vehicle exhaust contribution and time spent in vehicles) or infiltration (window opening).  Source profiles shall be identified by the contractor based on available published source profiles.  The contractor shall determine the source contributions from activities and identify  issues with using activity data based on modeling results.  The contractor shall provide the PMF2 data sets and modeling results.  The contractor shall also provide the final ME script, data sets, and modeling results.  The contractor shall prepare a report describing the results of this task.  The  contractor shall provide sample source contribution, source profiles, and data sets in an Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft?).  The contractor shall provide sample source contributions, source profiles, and data sets in Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft?),  figures in Sigma Plot (SPSS), and the report in  Word (Microsoft?). OPTIONAL Task 3: Manuscript describing the Task 1 and Task 2 results and update guidance document:  The contractor shall prepare a manuscript describing the results from Task 1 and 2 of this contract.  A manuscript (text, tables, and figures) shall be prepared by the contractor  for publication in Atmospheric Environment.  The "Guidance on the Receptor Modeling of Human Exposure Particulate Matter Data" report shall also be updated by the contractor to include the results from this task and also include recommendations for future analyses.  The contractor shall provide  final sample source contributions, source profiles, and data sets in Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft?),  figures in Sigma Plot (SPSS), and the manuscript and report in Word (Microsoft?).  Optional Tasks may be exercised by the government at a later date as funds become available.  DELIVERABLES:  Task  1: Receptor Modeling of the RTP Study Data: Sampling Artifacts and Infiltration:  Provide models and data sets that were used to evaluate the RTP Study data.  In addition, provide a report describing the Task 1 results.  Deliverable date: Approximately 6 months after providing data and start of  performance period.  Optional Task 2: Receptor Modeling of the RTP Study Data: Activity Data :  Provide models and data sets that were used to evaluate the RTP Study data.  In addition, provide a report describing the Task 2 results. Deliverable date: Approximately 12 months after providing data  and start of performance period.  Optional Task 3: Manuscript describing the Task 1 and Task 2 results and update guidance document:  Provide final models and data sets used to evaluate the RTP Study data.  In addition, provide a draft manuscript describing the Task 1 and 2 results, and update  the"Guidance on the Receptor Modeling of Human Exposure Particulate Matter Data" report prepared under contract number OD-5538-NAEX shall also be updated to include the RTP results and recommendations.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov : PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE : Proposal Submission Place: Department of State Inspection for Flight Safety Oversight of Uzbekistan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Civil Aviation Security Project - Uzbekistan : The Department of State Inspection for Flight Safety Oversight of Uzbekistan (DSFSO) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for a Civil Aviation Security Program for the country of Uzbekistan.

In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted a number of resolutions designed to assure the safety of passengers, ground crew personnel, and members of the public.  These resolutions have profound implications for the domestic civil aviation security programs of contracting states.  In order to fulfill its obligations as a member of the ICAO, and recognizing the necessity of protecting its citizenry from terrorist attack, the DSFSO requested that TDA fund this Study.  

In September 2002, funded a Definitional Mission (DM) to evaluate current civil aviation security policies and procedures, identify measures needed to comply with new ICAO standards, and to develop a comprehensive plan for modernizing and restructuring the Uzbekistan Civil Aviation Security System.

The DM concluded that in spite of the DSFSO’s best efforts, the Uzbekistan security program does not have the benefit of the direction provided by a Security Master Plan and is further handicapped by a severe lack of technological resources.  Manpower is readily available and the level of professionalism is quite high, but the state-of-the-art equipment necessary to accomplish essential functions is absent.

Uzbekistan’s primary airport is Tashkent (TAS).  The airport hosts more than 30,000 flights annually, transporting more than 1,000,000 international passengers, 500,000 domestic passengers and 20,000 transit passengers.  Both inbound and outbound freight average approximately 10,000 tons of cargo each year.  Four additional international airports include Bukhara (BHK), Samarkand (SKD), Termez (TMZ) and Urgench (UGC).  These four airports each average 2,500 flights annually, with 50,000 international inbound and outbound passengers, 25,000 domestic passengers and 15,000 transit passengers.  Outbound freight averages 900 tons and inbound 250 tons per annum.  All airports have Directors, Deputy Directors and Chiefs of Security; these civil authorities manage and oversea the security of each airport.  These civil authorities also oversee the military guards that staff the airfield’s perimeter security guard posts.  The Customs and Immigration staff works closely with their security counterparts.

The feasibility study would establish specific program and technological requirements necessary to modernize the Uzbekistan Civil Aviation Security System at all five of the nation’s international airports.  Commencing with a vulnerability analysis, the contractor should conduct a needs assessment to ascertain and validate specific requirements and estimate capital and operating costs for surveillance, access control, explosives detection, communications, and command and control.  This assessment should include plans, programs, equipment, training, and maintenance.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $549,995 grant to the DSFSO from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).  
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to Department of State Inspection for Flight Safety Oversight of Uzbekistan c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. June 2, 2003, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  DSFSO reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  DSFSO also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  DSFSO is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with IBM, of Hopewell Junction, New York for fifteen thousand (15,000) each Sintered Alumina Disks, and one (1) each Punch Die Rework/ Replacement.  This equipment will be used by the NIST Ceramics Division as feedstock for the renewal of a NIST Standard Reference Material 1976 (SRM) for X-Ray Diffraction.   

***Sole Source determination is based on the need for the Sintered Alumina Disks and Punch/ Die Rework or Replacement to have complete compatibility with the existing NIST system.  The technique for fabrication of the Sintered Alumina disks is exclusive to IBM.  This microstructure produces symmetry, with respect to texture, about the diffraction vector.   The starting material is relatively coarse grained and sintered in an anorthite glass matrix.  This technology results in an exhibition of minimum X-Ray line profile broadening, which is essential to the success of the NIST SRM.  IBM is the only known vendor who possesses equipment that can provide Sintered Alumina disks and Punch/ Die Rework or Replacement that will not broaden the X-Ray profiles essential to NIST SRM 1976.

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by May 8, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Science Planning and Assessment plans to enter into a sole source contract with RAND Corporation, 1200 South Hayes Street, Arlington, VA 22202.
The purpose of this project is to provide a written evaluation of selected existing U.S. tissue resources to support and guide the development of a design and engineering plan for a new National Tissue Resource model.  This effort is a collaborative project and jointly funded by the National Cancer Institute and the National Dialogue on Cancer. The evaluation will consider a collection of government, academic, and private sector tissue repositories to identify "best practices," and assess whether these resources could be adapted to fulfill the requirements of a new model for a National Tissue Resource. In 1999, RAND Corporation published a supplement to a National Bioethics Advisory Commission Report about the ethical and policy issues relation to research on human biological materials.  Dr Elisa Eiseman, an employee of RAND, was the Principal Investigator of the study and this proposed evaluation of selected existing U.S. tissue resources builds upon that effort and relies heavily on the previously-collected data.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, offerors who believe they are qualified for this effort may submit a qualification statement for consideration.  This statement must demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the previous publication, access to the data used for the publication, a listing of resources available for this project and a commitment from the principal investigator of the earlier work to consult/work on the project.  An original and one copy of the qualification statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on May 9, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a requirement for 1080 Loran-C Mark II Microsondes (Sippican Part Number 1543-611) to be delivered F.O.B. Destination to the National Logistics Support Center in Kansas City, Missouri commencing in July 2003.  Because this radiosonde now will be built with a chip thermistor, NOAA also requires an upgrade to the W-9000 ground system software, installation and checkout of the software at the Charleston, South Carolina upper-air site, and training in the use of the changed software.  NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Sippican, Inc. (Sippican), located in Marion, Massachusetts.  Sippican is the sole manufacturer of the Loran-C Mark II Microsonde and the W-9000 ground system and is the only known source that can provide the required supplies and services.  This acquisition will be accomplished using simplified acquisition procedures.  Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. WG9220-3-00117 will be issued on or about May 12, 2003 and will close on or about May 22, 2003.  NOAA expects award to be made not later than May 30, 2003.  Although NOAA expects that only Sippican can provide the required supplies and services, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by NOAA.  See Note 26.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Work Analyst Station to meet DISA's DoD Computer Emergency Response Team's (CERTs) and Regional CERT's operational needs
<SOLNBR>DCA100-03-T-4013
<RESPDATE>012103
<CONTACT>Barbara Janitis, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0754, Fax (703)681-1211, Email janitisb@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

Indicate your firm’s knowledge of local survey practices, records research and the approach you have used on previous surveys to resolve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.  Submit a sample surveyor’s report accompanied by a plat (suitable for filing in the public record), which identifies a boundary conflict and provides an appropriate solution or conclusion.

BE SURE TO RESPOND TO ALL FIVE (5) CRITERIA.    Additional Sheets should be used if needed to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.

Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with three or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services.  Negotiations will occur beginning with the most preferred firm in the final selection.  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.

Nationwide Shipyard Integration/Interoperability Concepts
The Navy has very recently asked NSRP to look into possible approaches that support nationwide shipyard integration/interoperability, including but not limited to Common Parts Catalog (CPC) type approaches.  The NSRP Strategic Investment Plan and the current Research Announcement are both structured to support these types of projects.  Because of this interest, an area of interest during this solicitation is continuing efforts related to the current Common Part Catalog (CPC) initiative, which has developed common processes and procedures for part definition and configuration management.  The CPC supports integrated design/manufacturing initiatives and provides the required data definition to support material control systems.  Standardizing part data allows an organization to search and find parts more quickly and accurately, to re-use part data and inventory among collaborating organizations, and results in fewer parts to procure, inspect and warehouse.  This results in increased demand for standard parts, which allows suppliers to better serve industry and organizations benefit from volume discounts.  Further, the U.S. Navy benefits by needing fewer parts to support for ships on-station and through the greater availability of parts across surface ships and submarine inventories.

All other provisions of the Research Announcement remain valid.  Proposals on any Research Announcement topic continue to be strongly encouraged.

<DESC>RED AIR THREAT PRESENTATIONS FOR COPE THUNDER EXERCISE. This is a sources sought synopsis only. There is NO solicitation for any action at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This sources-sought synopsis is being issued to conduct market research and determine availability of qualified sources. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the interested party for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The 15th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualified sources capable of providing all services necessary to meet the requirements as given below to include, but not be limited to, the use of appropriate aircraft, support personnel, and pilots to act as the Red Air threat during Cope Thunder Exercises at either Eielson AFB or Elmendorf AFB, AK.  

INTRODUCTION: COPE THUNDER is the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF’s) premiere composite force exercise designed to provide the finest training possible ensuring participating fighter pilots and aircrew receive at least 10 sorties in a realistic simulated combat environment.  There are currently two types of Cope Thunder Exercises.  Cooperative Cope Thunder exercises are tailored for foreign participation.  US only Cope Thunder exercises are mostly used for USAF Aerospace expeditionary Force (AEF) spin up.  All Cope Thunder Exercises are flown in the world’s largest range, complete with over 29 surface air defense systems and fourth-generation ACMI (Yukon Mission Debriefing System).  

REQUIREMENTS: There is a potential requirement to provide Red Air threat presentations for Cope Thunder Exercise 04-1 and beyond.  In order to accomplish this task, interested parties will provide dissimilar aircraft, proficient and experienced pilots, and the necessary support personnel and equipment to meet desired sortie rates.  Interested parties need to provide aircraft capable of replicating former Soviet Union Red Air tactics.  PACAF desires that the aircraft have the ability to replicate a Mig-29 and its ordnance.  In addition, pilots must have experience with advanced Red Air tactics flown in and against large formations.  Detail performance objectives are listed below:

1.	Performance Objective:  Deployment Requirements:  The interested parties need to be capable of deploying and redeploying their aircraft and necessary support equipment to either Eielson AFB or Elmendorf AFB, AK.  PACAF’s desired location is Eielson AFB.  
Performance Threshold: 100% of the time.
2.	Performance Objective: Location:  The contractor’s aircraft and pilots must be able to fly out of either Eielson AFB or Elmendorf AFB, AK to maximize attendance for briefings and debriefings. Performance Threshold: 100% of the time.
3.	Performance Objective:  Security Clearances:  The interested parties will ensure all pilots and any necessary maintenance personnel have a US Government Secret Clearance. A DD Form 254 is pending.  Performance Threshold: 100% of the time.
4.	Performance Objective:  Flying Support Requirements:  The interested party must support the desired sortie rate for a three week Cope Thunder exercise.  A typical three-week sortie count is highlighted below in Table 1.  During the first week, contractors will deploy aircraft, obtain local area briefs, and accomplish familiarization flights for all pilots.  During the exercise, the desired sortie rates are 8-10 aircraft flown twice a day.  Total aircraft sortie rates may vary.  Table 1 is provided for planning purposes only and highlights a typical stand-alone Red Air deployment consisting of a daily 8 turn 8.  Actual sortie requirements may vary per exercise.    PACAF may request a smaller contract Red Air force to augment existing Red Air Force provided by the Air Force.

<DESC>Request for Information: Purchasing Transaction Cost Analysis R400: Consulting and Study Services The USPS requests information on suppliers capabilities and qualifications to perform a purchasing transaction cost analyses. USPS performs several purchasing transactions across several purchasing organizations. Transactions are typically classified as simple, i.e. a task order to an existing contract, or complex, i.e. a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS), detailed market research (sourcing), supplier prequalification, etc. Below is listed the Purpose, Scope, and Objectives of the potential requirement. Purpose: Identify the probable level of costs related to purchasing transactions within the USPS Supply Management (SM) organization. Scope: The transaction costs to be measured in this analysis are those incurred from the point that the client (or internal customer) first contacts a buyer until the time that the order reaches the supplier or the service or product. The time that it takes the supplier to process the order and deliver the service or product is outside the scope of this analysis. The focus of the analysis is on the identification of significant cost drivers affecting numerous purchasing transactions and the assignment of representational costs to those drivers. The SM organization contemplates that the required level of analysis will be less rigorous than that used for more intensive time-and-motion studies or activity-based costing (ABC)

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is seeking to identify small businesses with the capability to provide high quality, high throughput DNA re-sequencing or genotyping for the DNA Re-sequencing and Genotyping (RS &G) Program.  The overall objective of the program is to obtain reliable, rapid, and cost efficient DNA re-sequencing and genotyping to assist investigators actively engaged in elucidating the genetic components involved in the cause, variable outcome, and progression of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  It is anticipated that the RS&G Program will comprise one to two laboratory centers for DNA re-sequencing, two to three laboratory centers for genotyping, and a Coordinating Center.  This sources sought announcement seeks small businesses as laboratory centers for DNA re-sequencing, genotyping, or both.

Under the RS&G Program, investigators from the NHLBI community will request use of the re-sequencing/genotyping service at no cost to the investigator.  The Coordinating Center will be responsible for receiving the requests.  An external panel of experts will evaluate the requests for caliber, interest, and feasibility for re-sequencing/genotyping.  On a regular basis, the panel will identify to NHLBI those studies recommended to receive the services during the upcoming period.  After approval by NHLBI, the laboratory centers will interact directly with the investigators to perform the requested re-sequencing or genotyping.  The laboratory centers will obtain the samples, provide temporary storage as needed, re-sequence the regions of interest or genotype the samples, provide the data/results to the investigator, and provide reports to the Coordinating Center and NHLBI.  The laboratory center investigators shall facilitate all aspects of the RS&G Program, specifically through the functions of the Steering Committee.

At contract award the laboratory centers must be established laboratories with capability for immediate high throughput, high quality production.  To meet the requirements of this sources sought announcement, current high quality as well as current high throughput must be documented in the capability statement.

At contract award each re-sequencing center shall have the capacity to sequence at least 60,000 kilobases per year at a cost of no more than $25.00 per kilobase.  The error rate shall be no more than 1 in 10,000 bases.

At contract award each genotyping center shall have the capacity to provide customized genotyping services for human gene variation of at least 500,000 genotypes per year at a cost of no more than $1.50 per genotype.  The error rate shall be no more than 1%.  

The initial total DNA re-sequencing effort (sum of all re-sequencing centers) is expected to sequence a minimum of 10 genomic regions per year of 10 genes in 48 chromosomes.  The initial total genotyping effort (sum of all genotyping centers) is expected to be capable of customized genotyping of at least 100 genes per year with an average 10 SNPs per gene in an average of 1000 individuals.  Further, when technology improves or needs change in the investigator community, the genotyping centers shall provide additional variations beyond SNPs and single-base insertions/deletions.

During contract performance, the laboratory centers will be responsible for incorporating new technologies and methodologies to increase production, decrease costs, and improve quality.  Requests from the investigator community to use the laboratory center services will be solicited to match the developing capacity of the laboratory centers.  Thus the first emphasis will be on candidate genes.  Named genes may be requested when capacity suffices, followed by requests for putative genes when full capacity is realized.  

The laboratory centers shall maintain the confidentiality of the data and results and shall not use the data and results for any purpose other than those expressly authorized by the contract.  The laboratory centers shall not isolate genomic DNA from tissues or cells received from investigators.

It is anticipated that the contracts will be cost-reimbursement, performance-based, for a period of 5 years.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  Small businesses who believe that they possess the capabilities to perform this work must submit an original and three copies of a capability statement to this office by May 23, 2003.   The capability statement must include documentation showing that throughput capacity and quality meet the minimums stated above.

<SUBJECT>A -- Nanomaterials Technology
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES TO COMMERCIALIZE NANOMATERIALS TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize an application of LLNL's proprietary nanomaterials technology (NMT). The technology is used to manufacture ceramic components for various applications (cutting tools, etc.).  

The material fabrication begins with inexpensive commercially available starting materials that are converted into nanopowders via a proprietary process developed within the Chemistry and Materials Science Department at LLNL. The process, which has been developed to the pound quantity production scale, employs simple laboratory equipment and low energy consumption. Typical nano-powders formed in this process include Al2O3, MgO, ZrO2, Y2O3, ceramic composites. The ceramic composites include ultra-fine mixtures of oxides, carbides, nitrides. 

Preliminary test results indicate that the process allows us to tailor nanostructure to suit special application needs such as low or high densities, fine or coarse agglomerate structures, and the distributed or continuous nature of multiphase structures. Ceramic components (3"diameter by 1/4" thick disks) and four point bend tests bars from such disks have shown high strength and toughness to date.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's nanomaterials technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
	1.	Company Name and address.
	2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing
	this technology.

 
Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000017-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in commercializing LLNL's nanomaterials technology.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a major federal agency that daily impacts the lives of all Americans.  The functions, services, and work products of NOAA are of great interest to citizens and to a large variety of public and private organizations.  It is important for NOAA, as a responsive federal agency, to communicate regularly and comprehensively to these groups and citizens. In order to improve NOAA's ability to communicate with and inform its constituents of key meetings, notices, and information, NOAA is seeking a Contractor to develop a modern Web-based Constituent Relationship Management System. The purpose of the system is to provide a multi-functional and interactive communications solution between NOAA through the Office of External Affairs and its constituents, interest groups, partners, universities, and grantees on NOAA matters and activities of interest to them.  The system will provide for a variety of critical communications between NOAA and its constituents, which shall include meeting notices, invitations, announcements, and reports. The system will provide a means of "two-way" communications between NOAA and its external partners/stakeholders concerning an array of key information. 

Background

NOAA's Office of External Affairs has an existing database, which was developed in the early 1990s.  Several attempts have been made to update and improve the database, which uses low-cost off the shelf products such as Word, Access, Eudora Light and Windows. The functionality of the current system includes sending faxes and e-mail merging. The system contains data on more than 10,000 constituents.  It sends out press releases and meeting invitations via email or fax. It also produces a variety of reports.

The current system has a number of serious drawbacks.  The system is a non-centralized PC-based single user system that does not operate in a LAN or networked environment and therefore must be installed on individuals PCs across numerous offices throughout NOAA.  There is no remote, on-line, or web-based access to the system. The system is not based upon modern Internet technologies. Constituents do not have access to key data and cannot update their information.  There is no ability to track the results of meeting notices.

General Requirements
Based upon knowledge and expertise in the development modern web-based systems, the Contractor shall develop a Constituent Relationship Management System.  The new system will combine the existing headquarters and Line Office standalone systems into a single centralized database.  It will be easily accessible to both NOAA constituent affairs officers and constituents around the world via a web-based user interface.  It will automate the delivery and tracking of constituent meeting invitations, acceptances, declinations and other communications.
Specific Requirements
The system will meet the following specific requirements:
1.   Developed using the Oracle DBMS
2.   Developed using Internet and TCP/IP protocols
3.   Developed using web-based protocols i.e. HTML, XML
4.   Server and PC manufacturer platform independent
5.   Developed with security and access controls
6.   Capability for data editing and validation by both constituents and constituent affairs officers at any location using a web browser.
7.   Provide for the issuance and sending of e-mails and faxes to constituents in an automated fashion
8.   Provide cross-cutting reporting capability across subject, geographic, and interest areas
9.    Provide automated issuance of invitations
10.  Provide automated tracking of responses to invitations
11.  Provide for automated offsite data and system backup
Technical Requirements
1.  Oracle DBMS Version 8 running in a Unix environment.  May develop in version 9 but  operational environment will be version 8 and Unix.
2.  Server-side Java using Tomcat or BEA Weblogic application server.  HTML and/or XML may also be used with the contractor specifying any tools and products used in the development and hosting, and the Government approving prior to start of project development.
3.  System must operate using the Internet Explorer browser or version 4.7 of the Netscape browser
4.  Security and access controls which meet NOAA's computer applications userID and password policy to be supplied to the contractor after award.
5.  Audit trail processing.
Task and Deliverables
1.  The contractor shall conduct a detailed requirements analysis and produce and submit to the COTR a draft requirements document.
2.  The contractor shall produce a final requirements document.
3.   The contractor shall develop and deliver to the COTR a draft system design,
4.   The contractor shall develop and deliver to the COTR a final system design, following input and comments from the COTR on the draft system design.
5.  The contractor shall program and code the system and provide a beta version of the system to the COTR,
6.  The contractor shall deliver the final system based upon changes identified by the COTR to the beta version.
7.   The contractor shall update the database and ensure that it is current.
8.  The contractor shall provide a schedule and project plan for all the above tasks and deliverables
9.  The contractor shall deliver system technical documentation (2 copies) of sufficient detail and clarity to allow Government IT staff to properly support, maintain and enhance the system
10. The contractor shall deliver 2 sets of user manuals of the system.
