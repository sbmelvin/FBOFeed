<DESC>As part of the ongoing effort to clean up the U.S. Department of Energy¡¦s (DOE) Hanford site in Southeastern Washington State, the environmental restoration contractor (ERC) for the DOE, Bechtel Hanford, Inc., (BHI) is seeking qualified businesses to perform remedial action activities.  The activities are associated with cleanup of waste sites in the 100-FR-1 and 100-FR-2 Operable Units in the 100-F Area.  The work, regulated under CERCLA, is expected to commence in the summer of 2005, and require approximately 3.5 years to complete.  The estimated subcontract value is $12-18M.

The work involves excavation and removal of radiologically and/or chemically contaminated soils and debris.  Work may be performed in radiation areas (including High Radiation Areas and Airborne Radiation Areas) and in various levels of PPE (including supplied air).

This work scope is for the remedial actions for the 100-FR-1 and 100-FR-2 Operable Unit (OU) burial grounds 118-F-1, 118-F-2, 118-F-3, 118-F-5, 118-F-6, 118-F-7, 118-F-9, 100-F-20, as well as remaining sites 116-F-8, 116-F-15, 116-F-16, 128-F-3, and 120-F-1. 


There are two categories of waste sites included in this work scope: 100-F Burial Grounds and Remaining Sites.  The remaining sites include five waste sites to be remediated (remove-treat-dispose [RTD]) and 13 optional remaining sites that may require remediation.  The necessity of remediation has yet to be determined for these 13 sites.  The remediation work scope for these 13 sites will be optional at the discretion of the CONTRACTOR.  The status of these 13 sites is subject to change.

100 F Burial Grounds

„h 118-F-1 Solid Waste Burial Ground.  The 118-F-1 site received radioactive equipment and other miscellaneous wastes from 105-F Reactor operations, including , but not limited to, the following: irradiated process tubing, dummy elements, gun barrel tips, steel sleeves, metal chips removed from the reactor, and filter boxes containing reactor graphite chips.

„h 118-F-2, Solid Waste Burial Ground.  This site received wastes from the biology facilities and the 105-F Reactor.  These wastes include, but are not limited to, miscellaneous solid wastes, and reactor components and hardware, such as dummy fuel elements.  Several large cylindrical sleeves, or silos, were used for disposal of liquid waste from 108-F and animal carcasses.

„h 118-F-3, Burial Ground No. 3.  This site received irradiated parts from the Ball 3X Project at the 105-F Reactor in 1952.  The waste was primarily 38 to 61 vertical safety rod (VSR) thimbles and also step plugs.

„h 118-F-5, Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) Sawdust Pit.  This site is an unlined trench that received radioactive sawdust from the floors of dog and swine pens in the 100-F Experimental Animal Farm (EAF).

„h 118-F-6, PNL Solid Waste Burial Ground.  This site was used for the disposal of solid waste from the 100-F EAF.  This site did not receive reactor-related waste.  There are two large railroad tank cars, also called ¡§submarines.¡¨  The tank cars were used for incineration of animal tissue and carcasses.  The residual ash and carcasses were left in the tank after each incineration. This waste is not anticipated to pose any potential chemical hazard but may have a limited biological hazard.

„h 118-F-7, 100-F Miscellaneous Hardware Storage Vault.  This site is an inactive solid waste storage vault used for temporary storage of slightly contaminated reactor parts.  It is not certain whether the vault is empty or full of lead and cadmium.  The vault is a concrete box that extends approximately 46 cm (18 in.) above grade.

„h 118-F-9, PNL Rad Site.  The site received undocumented miscellaneous solid wastes from animal research studies at the EAF.  Some odor may have developed from this waste.

„h 100-F-20, PNL Parallel Pits.  The site consists of two earthen pits or trenches, both oriented northeast to southwest.  The sites are believed to have been used to dispose of both radioactive and nonradioactive material from the EAF.  The northern trench may contain nonradioactive animal farm wastes, including, but not limited to, hardware, lumber, and soft materials.  The southern pit may have received radioactively contaminated animal feces and pen sweepings.

Remaining Sites:  Remove-Treat-Dispose

„h 116-F-8, 1904-F Outfall Structure.  The unit consisted of a reinforced, compartmentalized concrete weir box with walls extending from 7.6 m (25 ft) below grade to 0.3 m (1 ft) above grade.  The portion of the outfall that was above grade was demolished into its cavity.  The entire structure was covered with clean dirt.  The outfall site currently is an earthen mound.  The two 1.1 m (42-in.) diameter steel pipelines that exit the outfall extending into the river are not part of the 116-F-8 outfall site. The onshore ends of the pipelines will require sealing with concrete under this scope of work.

„h 116-F-15, 108-F Radiation Crib.  The site is located under the excavation of the 108-F Building (site 100-F-36).  The unit is a 0.91 by 0.91 by 0.91-m (3-by 3-by 3-ft) concrete sump, near the center of the 108-F Radiobiology Laboratory Building first floor.
 
„h 116-F-16, PNL Outfall.  The 116-F-16 site is where a large diameter pipeline met a concrete spillway that discharged waste water into the Columbia River.  The spillway was a 4.6-m (15-ft)-wide concrete structure that extended approximately 6.1 m (20 ft) out from the shoreline and approximately 3.7 m (12 ft) into the Columbia River.  The spillway sides were 0.46 m (18 in) high and extend down the length of the structure.  The vertical walls of the upper portion have been demolished and covered with soil.  The lower portion is intact and remains exposed.  The upper portions of the site have been demolished and covered with soil.  The lower portion of the flume is intact and visible.

„h 128-F-3, PNL Burn Pit.  A site investigation only found ash at the site with the ash exceeding cleanup levels for metals.
 
„h 120-F-1, Glass Dump.  The 120-F-1 Glass Dump is located southeast of the 105-F Reactor.  It is a shallow excavation 3 m by 10.7 m by 1.2 m (10 ft by 35 ft by 4 ft) deep and was used for the disposal of glass and miscellaneous materials from the 100-F Area.  Materials deposited in the trench generally include but are not limited to fluorescent light tubes, incandescent light bulbs, vacuum tubes, glass bottles, laboratory glassware, small batteries, plastic, styrofoam, and hand tools.  
 
Remaining Sites:  Optional Sites (Sites that may or may not be remediated under this scope of work)

„h 100-F-31, 144-F Sanitary Sewer System. The 100-F-31 septic system contained a septic tank and drain field that was located within the experimental animal farm.  Septic tank dimensions are 12 by 12 by 3 m (40 by 40 by 10 ft).  Piping for the 100-F-31 septic system included a 7.6-cm (3-in.)-diameter by 34-m (110-ft)-pipeline that exited the south side of the septic tank.  

„h 100-F-33, 146-F Aquatic Biology Fish Ponds.  The 100-F-33 waste site also referred to as the 146-F Aquatic Biology Fishponds and the fish laboratory was designed to conduct tests on fish.  It contained six matched pairs of small rearing pond/trough structures constructed of reinforced concrete.  Ponds 1-12 were match pairs; each 3.4 m by 2.9 m (11 ft by 9.5 ft).  Pond 13 was the largest with dimensions of 15.5 m by 1.8 m (51 ft by 6 ft).  It also contained a circular pond 30 ft in diameter.

„h 126-F-2, 183-F Clearwells.  The unit consists of covered, reinforced concrete basins, having a capacity of about 3.7E+07 liters (1E+07 gallons), separated in the center by a pump room. The concrete cover of the east clearwell has been demolished to permit dumping into the clearwell cavity.  The pump room was reinforced concrete and largely below grade.  The above-ground portion of the pump room has been demolished, and the below-ground portion has been filled with pump room rubble and backfill.  The west clearwell remains intact including it¡¦s steel reinforced concrete cover.  The east clearwell basin contains demolition waste.  At a minimum, removal of the demolition waste in the east clearwell is anticipated under this scope of work. 

„h 128-F-2, 100-F Burning Pit. The burn pit received nonradioactive combustible materials including but not limited to paint waste, miscellaneous office debris, chemical solvents, construction debris, and vitrified clay pipe.  Historical documentation suggests more than one pit is present at the site.  Each pit may have dimensions of 30.5 m by 30.5 m by  3 m (100 ft by 100 ft by 10 ft) deep.  Other documentation indicates that the burn pit is an 45.7 m by 18.3 m by 3 m (150 ft by 60 ft by 10 ft) deep irregularly shaped depression that received metal hardware and machinery.  During Hanford Site operations in the late 1970s concrete pole foundations and other debris were removed and buried and the landscape leveled. 

„h 132-F-1, 141-F Sheep Barn.  The 132-F-1 sheep barn, also referred to as the Animal Barn, Chronic Feeding Barn, and the Exposure Laboratory, was part of the experimental animal farm that was completed in 1950.  The facilities were designed to house stock animals that were exposed to radioelements of significance to operations at Hanford.  The building was a 455 sq. m (4,900 sq. ft) concrete block facility with a concrete floor and concrete animal pens on the inside and outside.  The sheep barn was demolished in 1977. 

„h 141-C, Large Animal Barn & Biology Laboratory.  A portion of the radiobiological experiments carried out at the 100-F EAF involved the use of large animals.  The 141-C Building provided facilities for the long-term housing and care of these animals.  The building was a single L-shaped structure with each wing measuring 35.4 m (116 ft) by 6.1 m (20 ft) wide by 2.4 m (8 ft) high and was demolished in approximately 1977.

„h 182-F, Reservoir.  The above-grade portion of the facility has been demolished.  The site is located on a relatively flat area north of 126-F-2 Clearwells.  This site received demolition rubble from the 182-F Pumping Station and the 183-F Water Treatment Building and Sedimentation Basins, and debris from other building demolitions.  At a minimum, removal of the demolition waste is anticipated under this scope of work.  

„h 1607-F3, Septic Tank.  The unit includes a septic tank, drainfield, and associated pipeline.  It is constructed of reinforced concrete; the walls and floor are 25 centimeters (10 in) thick.  The septic tank has a capacity of 5,432 liters (1,435 gallons).  The drainfield is constructed of 10-centimeter (4-in) vitrified pipe, concrete pipe, or drain tile with a total of 100 linear meters (328 linear feet) of piping (2.4 linear meters [8 linear feet] per capita).  The 20-centimeter (8-in) laterals are open jointed and spaced 2.4 m (8 ft) apart.  

„h 1607-F5, Septic Tank.  The site includes a septic tank, drainfield, and associated pipeline.  The tank is constructed of reinforced concrete; the walls are 20 centimeters (8 in) thick, and the floor is 15 centimeters (6 in) thick.  The septic tank has a capacity of 795 liters (210 gallons).  The drainfield is constructed of 10-centimeter (4-in) vitrified pipe, concrete pipe, or drain tile with a total of 14.6 linear meters (48 linear feet) of piping (2.4 linear meters [8 linear feet] per capita).  The laterals are open jointed and spaced 2.4 m (8 ft) apart. 

„h 1607-F7, 141-M Building Septic Tank.  The site is a septic tank, tile field, and a pipeline.  The septic tank has a volume of 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons).  

„h 100-F-36, 108-F Chemical Pump House.  The site includes remaining portions of the building foundation primarily at the southeast and southwest corners of the former building.  The former 108-F building originally was used as a chemical makeup facility in support of the 105-F Reactor.  

„h 100-F-38, Yellow Stained soil near hydrant F-2.  This site includes yellow stained soil discovered in 2000 during utility trenching activities.  The source of yellow staining is not known.  Radiological screening during the trenching activity did not indicate the presence of radiological contamination. 

„h 100-F-26, 100-F Water Treatment Facility Underground Pipelines.  This site includes all of the upstream (pre-reactor) process sewers for the 100-F Area, including all underground water lines used to transport reactor cooling water between the water treatment facilities and the 105-F Reactor building.  These include potentially contaminated underground lines running between buildings and those that run to drainage facilities.  The 100-F-26 pipelines site includes the underground pipelines from the 181-F river pumphouse to the 182-F reservoir, the 183-F basins and clearwells, the 184-F powerhouse, the 190-F buildings, 108-F biology laboratory, and to the 105-F reactor building.  Also, the drainage lines from the water treatment buildings to the junction with the 100-F-19 effluent pipeline at the animal farm are included in the 100-F-26 pipelines site.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about 12/08/2004 for an anticipated three year cost plus fixed-fee award, with two one year option periods.  The award of this effort that will be based on a “Best Value” evaluation for USAID/Colombia, Agriculture and Alternative Development Office (AADO), Coffee Alliances for the Expansion of Specialty Coffees (CAFES) Initiative.  USAID funding for the anticipated term of this effort will be at an estimated ceiling price of $15,000,000, depending on the availability of funding.

The aim of this program is to accelerate the pace of specialty coffee production in Colombia.  Therefore, several principles should be kept in mind when designing the technical approach.  First, strategic coordination and working in partnership with coffee organizations such as the National Coffee Federation (FEDERACAFE), Colombian Coffee Exporters (ASOEXPORT), other private exporters, exporter associations, specialty coffee associations, and buyers of specialty coffees  on the improvement of specialty coffees in identified growth poles. Some organizations may play a bigger role than others in the Colombian coffee sector.  For example, FEDERACAFÉ is a cross between a growers’ association and a parastatal, and is funded by an export tax on all coffee, with which the organization carries out public services in coffee growing areas, such as the building of rural social infrastructure.  In addition, FEDERACAFE is also involved directly in the business of coffee in that it buys, processes, warehouses, and exports 30 percent of all exported coffee.  In coffee trading matters, the organization is in competition with some 120 private firms that export nearly 70 percent of the coffee.  ASOEXPORT, for example, is such an organization. It represents some 27 of those exporters and serves mainly as a lobby with the GOC and a voice with FEDERACAFÉ.  All coffee-related entities in Colombia ought to be taken into consideration in designing this new program to ensure program reach and impacts are as broad as possible. The proposal must clearly describe the process for building strategic alliances with public and private sector coffee entities. 

Second, coordination with USAID’s on-going Colombia Specialty Coffee Program being implemented by contractor, ACDI/VOCA will also be vital.  The current Colombia Specialty Coffee Program continues until mid 2007, so for approximately two years both programs will be in implementation concurrently.  The proposal must clearly describe a strategy for coordination that will avoid duplication and will stimulate both programs to build on the accomplishments of the other.  

Partnerships and Strategic Alliances:  The nature of this program requires a strong partnership with coffee entities such as the Coffee Federation (FEDERACAFE) the Colombian National Association of Coffee Exporters (ASOEXPORT), and other private entities, to mention a few.   Although FEDERACAFÉ has the institutional structure and the mandate to work with the growers to promote improved quality coffee, to carry out research, and to market and promote Colombian coffees, private companies export two-thirds of Colombia’s coffee, and these organizations must also be involved in the program for it to be successful. Strategic alliances with the private sector, especially companies and associations involved with specialty coffees, will help ensure the success of the program.  These alliances can help USAID tap into additional and significant resources such as production technologies, quality controls and standards, marketing information, and funding for technical and social activities. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990.  The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debt, on behalf of the Armed Forces Retirement Home, intends to issue a solicitation for radiology services.  This acquisition is an unrestricted procurement, the NAICS code is 621111, and the size standard is $8.5 million.  This solicitation will result in a contract with a base and four one-year option periods.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide radiology services for the residents at the Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington, DC (AFRH-W).  The duties shall include a full range of radiology services in a geriatric environment located at the King Health Center (KHC).  The AFRH-W serves the inpatient and outpatient needs of approximately 1150 residents.    

The Contractor shall provide to the residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home – Washington, DC (AFRH–W) radiology services required to abide by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation on Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) standards and AFRH-W policies and operational instructions.  The Contractor shall serve as a licensed radiologist at the King Health Center (KHC), a 250-bed, long term care facility which services the inpatient and outpatient needs of the AFRH-W, a continuing care community.    

The critical element of this contract is the ability of the Contractor to provide third party billing services and accept their reimbursement as payment in full.  Details are listed below:

RESIDENTS’ INSURANCE AND BILLING:  
AFRH-W residents have Medicare, TRICARE FOR LIFE or TRICARE PRIME and some have supplemental medical insurance.  At the present time, TRICARE requires that services be requested through the Primary Care Physician in order for TRICARE to be billed for services.  

The Contractor shall apply for and become a network provider under the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract or follow-on TRICARE contract and any other third party insurance program for those residents under his/her care.

The Contractor is responsible for obtaining insurance information and Informed Consent from the residents.  Insurance information and Informed Consent will be provided to the Contractor by the residents of the AFRH-W at the time services are rendered.  The Contractor shall ensure the residents fully understand that their private insurance will be billed for services.  In the case of a resident who does not have coverage,  the AFRH-W will pay for services at the Tricare rate of reimbursement.  Uninsured residents make up approximately 10% of the resident population at the AFRH-W.     

THIRD PARTY BILLING:
The Contractor shall bill the residents’ insurance company directly for reimbursement of radiology services.    Residents and/or their insurance companies will be responsible for payment of all services including co-payments.  The Government is not responsible for payment, and the Contractor shall not bill the Government for these services.  The Government will pay for co-payments for those residents who do not have insurance or are unable to obtain insurance.   The Government will pay the contractor for services at the TRICARE rate of reimbursement for residents without insurance. 	

Other requirements are as follows:
Contractor radiologists shall have the following qualifications:  
The Contractor shall ensure the services are performed by a radiologist who has successfully completed a curriculum in radiology approved by a recognized professional accrediting organization at the time the curriculum was completed by the Contractor’s employee.  The Contractor radiologist shall have at least five (5) years experience in the field.

The radiologist has successfully completed the clinical affiliation requirements prescribed by the school, as well as the National Board Examination.  The radiologist must possess a valid current license in the District of Columbia.  All applicable documents, including but not limited to the license or certification shall be made available to the Health Care Services Directorate (HSCD) Credentials Committee.  Approval/Verification by HSCD Credentials Committee shall be obtained prior to any radiologist providing services under this contract.  These requirements also apply to any new and/or backup radiologists for which the Contractor may seek approval to perform under this contract.  

Government Furnished Property:
The AFRH-W will provide the existing clinic space, utilities, furniture, exam room equipment, and attached physical assets needed to provide radiology services for the resident population.

Contractor Furnished Items:
The Contractor shall provide all necessary equipment.  All equipment shall be approved by the Healthcare Services Administrator and the AFRH-W Safety Officer prior to use.  This equipment shall be inventoried by the Contractor.  

The Contractor shall provide general radiology services.  The Contractor radiologist must be available on a full-time basis, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week in the KHC.  The Contractor shall schedule and provide services within a two to four hour window of receiving the order for radiology service.  The Contractor shall provide general radiology services to include:  chest, abdomen, extremities, and ultrasound.    The Contractor shall service residents in both the in-patient an out-patient areas.  The Contractor shall practice reasonable measures in the management of clients to ensure their safety.

	The Contractor shall provide the required services and document the services provided in the patient records.  The original patient records are kept by AFRH Medical Records Department.  The Contractor may duplicate the records for use in billing the Medicare or third party insurance.   The Contractor shall participate in the KHC’s Quality Assurance Assessment and Improvement Program to the extent required by KHC.  Quality assurance assessment and improvement meetings are held monthly and last approximately one hour.  Sharing of resident medical information at AFRH-W shall follow all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) regulations.

<DESC>The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Dynamics Technology, Inc., for Multi-Phenomenology Source Term and Propagation Modeling.  The primary objective of this effort is to develop an integrated modeling suite for prediction and characterizing multi-phenomenology signals emanating from equipment and facilities.  The modeling suite will consist of imported facility models, source term models, and multi-phenomenology propagation models.  The architecture will allow for the easy integration of future source term and propagation models.  The sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Evaluation of the contractor’s unique capability and existing products, concluded that the highly specialized effort required is available from only one source.  A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is contemplated with one-year basic contract period and a 1-year option period.  This effort would require both a facilities and storage capability of at least the SECRET NO FOREIGN level, and the ability to support secure communication capabilities at the SECRET NO FOREIGN level.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and size standard are 541330/$23.0 million.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.

<DESC>POC1Lt Rebbecca Drydol-Brandon, Contracts Manager, (781) 377-9303. The Global Air Traffic Operations (GATO) Mobility Command and Control System Program Office ESC/GA, at the Electronics Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, MA is seeking qualified sources for the acquisition of the Air Force Airfield Automation System (AFAS).  The AFAS is a commercial off the shelf/non-developmental item system comprised of computer workstations and associated software and hardware.  The AFAS shall be a fully developed data display system that, preferably, has been previously fielded and requires minimal adaptation to handle Air Force weather data inputs.  AFAS must consolidate multiple airfield displays and control units to transmit, receive and display weather and airfield data from multiple sources.  AFAS should also provide monitoring and control capability for radio navigation aids, airfield lighting, and remote video cameras.  Data from the system will be disseminated over a local area network (LAN) to workstations located in air traffic control towers and the Radar Approach Control (RAPCON) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) rooms.  The AFAS shall accept and display weather and airport environmental data from both existing sensor systems and from manually keyed inputs; the system must accept and display wind speed and direction, digital altimeter, and free text data from local on-site weather sources.  As an objective, the system should accept and display weather alerts, warning, and advisories from local and remote site weather sources, wind speed and direction, digital altimeter and free text data from remote site weather sources (i.e., Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) and Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS)).  The AFAS shall accept and display:  video from a remote camera feed; automated Airport Terminal Information Service (ATIS) through New Tactical Forecast System (NTFS); and digital time, in both Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and local time.  The AFAS should accept and display Navigational Aid (NAVAID) status via both electronic interface and manual input.  As an objective, the system should provide monitoring and control of NAVAID functions via direct interface to the NAVAIDS.  Additional AFAS objectives include: NEXRAD interface and NOTAM processing; airfield lighting control; interface to Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO); and display of airfield environment and equipment status such as runway / taxiway closures, barrier status, equipment outages. The AFAS must provide electronic media storage and retrieval of position logs, daily operations logs, Flight Instrument Publications (FLIP) charts, site dependent data, and system status reports.  The system must provide the capability for users to input and display free text information.  The AFAS displays must be visible in both daylight and reduced lighting conditions to accommodate use in control towers and radar facilities.  The system must support up to 24 workstations in large facilities, 12 in medium facilities, and 6 in small facilities.  As an objective, the system will support 50 workstations in large, 24 in medium, and 6 in small facilities.  The AFAS availability requirement is 99%; system Mean Time Between Critical Failure (MTBCF) requirement is 5,000 hrs or more; system Mean Repair Time (MRT) shall not exceed 0.5 hrs; Mean Time To Restore System (MTTRS) shall be less than or equal to 6 hours.  Maximum Repair Time (MaxRT) must be less than or equal to 1.5 hrs.  Required Scheduled Maintenance shall not exceed two (2) hours, once a quarter, with less than or equal to 0.5 hours per event.  As an objective, the system will incorporate Built-in Test/Fault Isolation capable of detecting and isolating 90% of all faults in automatic mode, and 98% of all faults in automatic with manual action mode, to a single LRU; Fault Isolation and Detection using all means will be 100% down to the Line Replacement Unit (LRU).  The system must incorporate a “fail soft” capability so as to limit the possibility of a total system-level outage (note: individual workstations do not require a fail soft capability, as the mission can continue by use of other workstations in the facility).  As an objective, the system should automatically recover from degraded modes without the need to “reboot” the entire system or otherwise make the entire system unavailable to users.  Data processing delays must not exceed 1.5 seconds for operations internal to the airfield automation system (note: this requirement does not include internet-related response times nor the length of time it takes for remote sensors to process and transmit information to the airfield automation system or respond to requests generated by the airfield automation system). The AFAS shall contain provisions for an optional conditioned uninterruptible power system (UPS) for sites, which do not have facility power condition systems/UPS available.  The AFAS shall incorporate a password protection scheme; the system must assign a separate and unique-user identifier and password to each user.  The AFAS must be delivered with complete technical/maintenance documentation..  Optional technical support for the AFAS, and contractor training, are desired.  Other topics of concern are delivery availability, cost, and maintenance support.  The Government is interested in procuring systems that will support the installation of 652 user workstations in 44 RAPCONs and 54 remote Towers over a period of three years, from FY 2005 through FY2007.  A comprehensive statement of AFAS performance requirements will be available on ESC’s Business Opportunities Website (http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil) on or about 6 Dec 2004.  To be considered qualified to meet the AFAS requirement, interested companies must submit information detailing their capabilities/experience that comply with the following criteria: (1) – (XX), as needed to assess qualified of interested sources. Interested firms must provide two copies of their qualification package detailing your specific capabilities to meet the above stated criteria to ESC/GAK, 75 Vandenberg Drive, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2103, Attn:1Lt Rebbecca Drydol-Brandon (Rebbecca.Brandon@hanscom.af.mil).

<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will be procuring a Shipboard Protection System (SPS) to support Shipboard and Expeditionary Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) initiatives. An RFI for this system was issued 29 September 2004 under Solicitation # N00024-04-R-6234. The revised Solicitation # is N00024-05-R-6304. NAVSEA intends to issue the solicitation on approximately 23 December 2004 for a period of 45 days. In order to accommodate questions, the Performance Specification and SOW will be released prior to the solicitation for review and comments. The Performance Specification is attached to this announcement.  The SOW will be posted on approximately 29 November 2004. SPS DESCRIPTION: SPS consists of shipboard installed mission specific hardware, software, and firmware components that will enable a “Navy combatant vessel” to perform anti-terrorism / force protection (AT/FP) functions.  SPS will enhance the ability for Naval vessels to accomplish self-protection while moored to a pier, at anchor, or during restricted maneuvering.  SPS will provide the Navy with a fully integrated and seamless sensor, analysis, and response system that will provide the means for 360o situational awareness and engagement capability to counter asymmetric AT/FP threats around-the-clock with no increase in manning.  The operational concept for the initial and objective systems is to provide a flexible layered defense with situational awareness, deterrence, and engagement zones being defined by the system operator.  This system should be modular and expandable and should support installation / operation on multiple ship classes / platforms within the Navy.  The ! initial increment of this system must immediately provide the ability to support stand-alone operations for a single vessel and must be designed to be ultimately integrated within multi-ship and/or shore side AT/FP envelopes.  This capability must be available, operable, and supportable in both overseas and continental U.S. ports and waterways.  This capability will provide surveillance, detection, identification, tracking, deterrence, engagement, and command & control functions for both own-ship and own-ship deployable assets that can be applied to appropriately counter surface, subsurface, and airborne threats.  SPS Increment I will be designed to counter multiple asymmetric surface waterborne threats.  This increment will use, but not limited to, existing organic shipboard capabilities plus the following capabilities: 1)	Enhanced detection and tracking of surface targets 2)	A capability to hail and warn small boat crews and surfaced swimmers 3)	A basic situational awareness capability to aid in Force Protection (FP) 4)	Enhanced control of shipboard lethal weapon systems and enhance the display and availability of information to decision makers for the employment of small arms 5)	A basic open architecture Force Protection (FP) command and control (C2) system. Please review the Performance Specification and the forthcoming SOW and provide comments and questions to brownca@navsea.navy.mil. All comments and questions must be received electronically.  Do not phone-in any questions or comments, they will not be answered or considered.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Common Video Borescope Set (CVBS)        


NAVAIR Lakehurst is interested in receiving proposals for conducting a concept study in the development of the next generation Common Video Borescope Set (CVBS).  The CVBS is to be used by the Naval aviation maintenance community.  The proposal shall describe the proposed CVBS design and support aspects, which would include costs associated with conducting the proposed study.  Submission of a proposal to this BAA within the first 45 days of this announcement is encouraged.  Responses will be accepted at the NAVAIR Lakehurst Contracts department any time during the three-month period from the date of this announcement.  A follow-on contract may be awarded for the development of a CVBS prototype and/or production units.

Background:  Borescopes are primarily required to inspect the internal components located within the aircraft’s primary (aircraft engine) and secondary power plants Auxiliary Power Units (APUs).  This task is accomplished by Navy and Marine Corp aircraft maintenance personnel at the “O” and “I”-level maintenance community.  The borescope is used to inspect for such defects as cracks, dents, tears, nicks, and chips on engine components  (blades, vanes, liners, nozzles, etc.).  Although a substantial proportion of the maintenance usage of the borescope is to inspect the aircraft power plant, it is anticipated that more airframe internal visual inspections (corrosion control, fuel cells, bulkhead, etc.) will be realized as more aircraft surfaces are built with composite materials.  The Fleet maintenance community will be transitioning from the traditional fiberoptic borescopes to the video borescopes.   Current performance capability features include: freeze frame image; zoom; LCD display; and image storage.  

As the Fleet transitions to video technology, there are factors that must be addressed because they affect the ability to provide cost wise maintenance support using this technology.  Experience with existing video borescopes makes it imperative that both hardware and software changes are required to have a cost-effective program.

Goals:
(1) Improve survivability
(2) Reduce proliferation/inventory
(3) Reduce maintenance cost
(4) Improve training and reliability
(5) Upgradeable design
(6) Maximize commonality between the “O”-level and “I”-level

Survivability can be improved if problems encountered during the insertion of the borescope tip are reduced or eliminated.  Increased training may alleviate some issues, but improved hardware designs are necessary to significantly decrease failure rates due to the Fleet’s operational environment that often requires rapid turn around of aircraft and necessitates the use of a borescope on a hot engine. The proposed CVBS shall have a high temperature resistant tip and an integrated warning system to alert Fleet maintainers when engines are not sufficiently cooled down.  The concept study should address any trade-offs between CVBS non-recurring and recurring costs versus temperature resistance.  There should additionally be in place a warning system to notify the operator if the insertion tube is still in the engine.  Any additional features that will improve CVBS survivability in the Fleet environment will be considered highly valuable.

A goal of this BAA is to allow the CVBS to support a significant number of naval aircraft power plants and airframe inspections, if not the entire Fleet inventory.  The design of the proposed CVBS should be flexible to support future platforms such as the: Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), Heavy Lift Replacement (HLR), Presidential Helicopter (VXX), Advance Hawkeye (AHE), and other upcoming systems at the time of the BAA.  A matrix of current inventory of the Fleet’s borescopes is available upon request from the contracting officer.  The proposal shall identify current power plant and airframe inspection requirements for all naval aircraft and how the proposed CVBS would have the versatility to address these requirements.  This consolidation will reduce the Fleet’s inventory and operating costs.

High repair costs have driven the borescope program towards a desired standardized system to reduce this cost.  The proposed CVBS shall demonstrate a repair program that minimizes the repair cost and turn-around-time associated with the repair of the most prevalent damage (broken tip or insertion tube).  Maximum effort should be designed into the CVBS to allow the maintainer the ability to repair the system in the field, therefore increasing availability and decreasing downtime.   Logistical support for the maintainer should be considered and the availability of spare parts to repair at the local level is highly desirable.  The concept study should address expected costs as a function of recurring unit cost and turn-around-times for the repair of high failure CVBS components.

The reliability of the inspection is dependent on the training of the maintainer.  The proposal shall identify and develop a program that produces improved reliability of the inspection.  The CVBS concept study shall address proposed standards, software programs, computer-based training, or other means to identify typical profiles of defects encountered in the field.  These products should be designed to  aid in the training of the maintainer or to assist in the inspection directly.

The ability to upgrade both CVBS software and hardware to support new requirements or capitalize on future innovations from industry shall be identified.   The concept study should address the ability to perform software upgrades in the Fleet and to administer any required hardware changes as seamlessly as possible.   The design of the CVBS should allow the Navy to easily take advantage of new technologies as they evolve in the commercial market.  Proposed innovations are not limited to the above and any improvements in Fleet maintenance operations will be considered highly valuable.

The “I”-level maintenance department performs defect measurement using borescopes.  “O”-level” maintenance only inspects for the presence of defects.  The CVBS’ technical proposal shall address defect measurement capability as an option for an “I”-level variant.  The added feature of defect measurement shall be discussed as to the increased design and cost of the upgraded system.  The optimum scenario would be to design a defect measurement system that is simple to use at the “O”-level.  Minimal operational and interpretation usage is required.  Scheduled maintenance (such as calendar, phase, conditional, and special inspections) currently performed by the “I”-level may be transitioned to the “O”-level, if a suitable defect measurement capability is developed.      

Constraints:  For many years, individual aircraft platforms have maintained an inventory of borescopes tailored to service their specific power plant or airframe.  This lack of standardization has led to supply and logistic support problems.  There should be collected data to indicate to the platforms that the CVBS will address all their requirements and be advantageous in terms of increased technical and cost effectiveness.  Knowledge and support of the Fleet Support Teams’ (FSTs’) requirements for the power plant and airframe inspections are key performance parameters to this study.  The proposal should highlight the ability of the proposed CVBS to meet all the inspection requirements of each platform and consequently replace the specific platform borescopes in the Fleet.        

Under both controlled and adverse weather conditions, the CVBS shall be durable enough to withstand repeated use at the “O” and “I”-level for both afloat and ashore activities under changing operational and environmental conditions.  The requirements of MIL-STD-810 apply to the following conditions: high and low operating/storage temperatures; humidity; salt fog; sand; and explosive atmosphere.  The CVBS shall meet the electromagnetic interference (EMI) requirements of MIL-STD-461 for below deck locations. 

Design and performance parameter objectives for the CVBS are as follows:

(1)	Compact, self-contained and portable.  Shall withstand rugged use, repeated assembly and disassembly.
(2)	Battery-operated, as well as from an AC power source, minimum operating time on batteries of 2 hours.
(3)	Dimensions: Volume of 1200 cubic inches or average  length, width, or height of 12 inches
(4)	Weight: Twenty (20) lbs. with the batteries installed.
(5)	Have simple operating controls that are easily observed, reachable, and manipulated

	
Proposal Guidance:  The proposal should consist of two separately bound volumes. Volume I shall provide the technical proposal and management approach.  Volume II shall address cost.  Offeror shall submit five copies of Volume I and three copies of Volume II.  Additionally, the offeror must identify restricted rights to any part of the offer, if any, and mark all pages that contain proprietary or restricted use data. Volume I should be limited to 25 pages and include, as a minimum: 

(1)	Conceptual design
(2)	Resources and facilities available to conduct studies
(3)	Qualification of personnel
(4)	Related projects/performance
(5)	Approach for conducting detailed design & analysis
(6)	Maturity of proposed technology.

Additionally, conceptual designs should have considerations for system affordability and reduced life cycle costs. 
Volume II should be limited to 10 pages and include costs associated with performing the concept study and delivery of associated reports.  
Proposals will be evaluated as they are received. Award decisions will be based on the availability of funds and the following criteria: 

(1)	Soundness and innovation of proposed concept
(2)	The offeror’s ability to demonstrate feasibility of meeting all identified CVBS goals
(3)	The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives
(4)	Soundness of scientific/engineering approach
(5)	Proposed innovations outside of the outlined goals
(6)	Validity of proposed cost. The cost of preparation of the response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract nor any other contract. 
(7)	Past performance
(8)	Cost

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to compete a requirement currently being performed by McKesson BioServices Corporation under Contract No. N01-AI-85332.  This solicitation is being issued under full and open competitive procedures.  DAIDS (www.niaid.nih.gov/daids) was formed in 1986 to develop and implement the national research agenda to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Today, with the ever-changing demographics of the epidemic, DAIDS is expanding its focus to a more global research agenda with an emphasis on an integrated prevention and therapeutics agenda in developing nations.  Specifically, the mission of DAIDS is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  Through the contemplated contract, DAIDS supports the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ARP) in achieving its goal of providing critical research reagents and resources to the scientific community.  An important rate-limiting step in basic research is the identification and distribution of state-of-the-art reagents and technology.  Since its establishment in 1988, the ARP has evolved from a small bank of research materials to a unique and versatile worldwide resource of critical reagents not otherwise readily available to the HIV/AIDS research community.  In 2002, the ARP contract was amended to provide reagents for biodefense research and other infectious diseases including transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE).  In addition to research reagents for HIV/AIDS, the ARP has provided reagents for hepatitis C virus, anthrax and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus research. The ARP acquires state-of-the-art reagents; produces these reagents, standardized panels, and protocols; and then provides these reagents at minimal cost to qualified investigators throughout the world.  Additionally, the ARP collects information about AIDS-related reagents and standards and disseminates this information through print, electronic media, and enhances technology transfer by developing standard reagents and kits, and sponsoring workshops on their use.  ARP facilitates commercial development of reagents through proactive communications with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.  In 2002, ARP promoted commercial development of MHC class I/peptide tetramers by developing a market for these reagents.  Availability of quality controlled, custom made tetramers through the ARP resulted in their increased use and demand, which is now met by the commercial sector.  ARP participates as an AIDS Collaborating Center of the joint United Nations Program in HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) Centralized Facility for AIDS Reagents.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about September 26, 2005.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 10, 2004, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to award of a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a one-year membership with Edison Welding Institute to procure a one-year extension in NASA’s membership in the EWI as well as a one-year extension in NASA’s license to use the friction stir welding process.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Edison Welding Institute to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	The EWI is a non-profit, membership-based organization that provides metals joining expertise in the area of welding process selection, optimization, troubleshooting, and research.	The EWI is the largest industrial consortium dedicated to welding in the United States with an estimated $9.0 Million annual applied research program dedicated to metals joining procedures and process development, which makes it the only source with the resources to address critical welding issues.	There are no other organizations in the U. S., which offer these services. 2.	Membership in the EWI will enable NASA personnel to have direct access to a broad array of researchers and analysts with expertise in the welding of aerospace materials.  This expertise has been a direct benefit in the realm of NASA welding activities including, but not limited to: resolution of weld cracking in the Super Lightweight External Tank Program, continued microfissure elimination in the Space Shuttle Main Engine Program, the development of the friction stir weld process, and providing other welding support services to NASA and aerospace contractors.  In order for NASA to have access to this, it must pay EWI a membership fee directly.  Membership is not available from any other source.	 3.	The EWI’s sister organization, The Welding Institute, Cambridge, U.K., holds all intellectual property rights to the friction stir welding process.  No other entity, worldwide, offers a similar welding process.  NASA is developing the FSW process for NASA programs.  In order for NASA to use this process, it must obtain a license directly from EWI.  The license is not available from any other source.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 29, 2004.

<DESC>This project is for the construction of an approx 120' long, 6' wide hiker/stock bridge. It will probably have concrete spread footings w/3 steel girders, timber deck & railing. It is anticipated that the bridge will be designed with 2 splices in each girder with each girder section weighing approx 4,000 lbs. The east side will have a short approach. Project is not in wilderness, mechanized equipment will be allowed on site. All bidders should be aware that a final decision to build the bridge at this site awaits completion of the NEPA process. Project is being advertised to allow prospective bidders the opportunity to visit the site before winter conditions prevent access. The solicitation will be issued during the winter months. Estimated start work date is approx April 1, 2005 with project completion date approx May 27, 2005. The Government's estimated price range is between $100,000 to $250,000. Bonds will be required for this project. THIS IS PROJECT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. To reach project site, from Newhalem, WA take State Route 20 east approx 10 miles to the Colonial Creek Campground. Hike the trail up Thunder Creek approx 3/4 mile to the old crossing location (washed out Oct 2004 by a log jam). Follow blue flagging up the west side another 3/4 mile to the bridge site where Abutment #1 is staked (Sta 1+00). There are two alternate alignments (A & B) which are about 14 degrees apart. A is more perpendicular to the creek and B is skewed approx 30' upstream at Abutment #2. Abutment #2 (east side) is adjacent to the Thunder Creek Campground. Note: The trail to Abutment #1 will be constructed by Natnl Park Svc crews in Spring of 2005 but may not be done prior to bridge construction.

STATEMENT OF WORK
ASSEMBLE MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM COMPONENTS

Project location: 	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, NERL, ERD
960 College Station Rd.
Athens, GA 30605-2700

Work to be performed:

The contractor shall provide all specialized technically skilled workers and all equipment necessary to assemble the components, parts and support equipment, including the positioning of the magnet assembly, of a used mass spectrometer system now location in Room 253 of ERD and make the system operational.  The contractor shall perform sensitivity and response tests to establish performance specifications as specified by the U.S. EPA.

Equipment to be assembled and made operational:

Micromass Autospec Mass Spectrometer (SN# S181)
Vax Station 4000-96
HP G1530 Gas Chromatograph
HP LaserJet 5SI
Miscellaneous pumps and accessories.

This system was operational prior to its removal, disassembly, and transport to this location.

Assemble the components of the mass spectrometer:

The various components of this used mass spectrometer system are located in Rooms 253 and 254 on the second floor of the Main Building of the Ecosystems Research Division at 960 College Station Rd., Athens, GA.

The electrical safety switch (disconnect) and the electrical transformers are located along the west wall of the instrument room 253.  Electrical cables will lie across the floor at the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.  EPA will connect the wiring from the safety switch (disconnect) down to the first transformer.  The contractor will need to connect from the first transformer to the second transformer, then to the instrument.  All other electrical connections on the instrument will be performed by the contractor.

The circulating water chiller is located along the west wall of the instrument room 253.  The water lines will lie across the floor at the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.  EPA will set up the water chiller and install a loop hose from the water outlet to the water inlet and the unit will be ‘on’ and cooling to 15oC and circulating water through the loop hose.  The contractor will need to remove the loop hose and connect inlet and outlet hoses between the circulating water cooler and the instrument.  

The rotary vacuum pumps are located in Room 254, which is immediately adjacent to the instrument room on the north and west side of the instrument location.  The connecting cables and hoses for these pumps will pass through ports cut in the separating wall and will lie across the floor to the rear (west side) of the mass spectrometer for connection between the instrument and the support equipment.

The minimum equipment needed to perform the assembly of this instrument and supporting equipment will be various common hand tools (screwdrivers, wrenches, pliers, etc.), power tools (drills, screwdrivers, etc.), a meter to check the voltage, current, and phase of the incoming electrical power before making final electrical connections to the instrumentation, and a lift capable of picking up the magnet from approximately 4” above the floor to approximately 60” above the floor, which will allow the magnet to be rolled into place once it has been raised to the correct height.

Floor plan of Rooms 253 and 254 is being provided as an Attachment to this Request for Quotation.  

Cleaning of the equipment

The equipment to be assembled and made to function under this contract is used and has dirt and oil deposits both within the cabinet and on some external surfaces.  The contractor shall clean up all dirt and oil deposits as much as practical from all surfaces.

Loose trash (paper) and other non-instrument items (screws, nuts, etc.) are inside the cabinets of this instrument.  The contractor will remove all items not necessary to the operation of this instrument.  Equipment was in full operating condition in the spring of 2003, and has been in storage since mid-summer, 2003.

EPA furnished items:

EPA will grant access to the building and to these two rooms to authorized contractor personnel for the purpose of working on this project.

EPA will provide the instrumentation of this system to be assembled.  

EPA will provide the support equipment, such as the water chiller, necessary to allow the instrumentation to perform properly once it is assembled.

EPA will provide electricity, air conditioning, and water at designated outlets only.

Items not furnished by EPA:

EPA will not furnish equipment, materials, nor tools of any kind beyond those identified under “EPA furnished items” and under “Equipment to be assembled and made operational”.  EPA will not furnish nor lease equipment for the contractor’s use on this project.

EPA will not have nor make workers available to assist the contractor with this project.

Performance Criteria:

The instrument will not be required to meet the original instrument specifications (as for a brand new instrument), but specifications that would be reasonable for a used, older instrument.  The performance specifications to be carried out would insure a minimum of 20,000 resolution (using perfluorokerosene) and a sensitivity of at least 2xE6 for a 2uL injection of an organic calibration mix (EPA#626) of 50 compounds containing 10 ng each of chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 1000 resolution; GC conditions:  DB-5 column (J&W Scientific/Agilent), 30-m, 0.25-mm ID, 0.25-um film thickness.

Specified GC conditions for meeting performance requirements are:  GC temperature program:  35oC, held for 4 min, followed by an increase at a rate of 9oC/min to 285oC, and held for 30 min.

These evaluations will be demonstrated to the Technical Coordinator, with confirmation provided to the Contracting Officer.  

Performance Period:

EPA and the contractor will mutually agree on the exact date of the assemblage.  However, the agreement should be within 30 days of receiving a quote from the Contractor.

Evaluation Criteria:

These qualifications are listed in order of importance, with 1 being the most important.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This Amendment to a combined synopsis/solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on-line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This is Amendment 0001 to the combined synopsis/solicitation N00178-05-R-1005 to answer questions that were received from industry.  Questions regarding Modular Wearable Computer (MOWC) Solicitation:  QUESTION(1) Could you more clearly define the required interfaces (USB, RS232, etc) for each of the connected devices? ANSWER 1 (A) The USB interfaces are standard USB with standard USB connectors. (female connection on the computer to accept a male connector).  One US! B interface connects the DE UAV RF gear to the computer and this interfaces carries NTSC video and telemetry data. ANSWER 1(B) One RS232 interface needs to support analog video in (NTSC), DC power (12 VDC [10-12.5max], 700mA max) and bi-directional RS232 (3-wire, 9600 baud).  The RS232 connection on the computer shall be a mil-spec connector that is TBD. ANSWER 1 (C) Second RS232 interface needs to support analog video out (NTSC), DC power (12 VDC nominal [11-16 VDC], 600mA nominal, can spike to 700mA max) and bi-directional RS232 (3-wire, 9600 baud).  The RS232 connection on the computer shall be a mil-spec connector that is TBD.  QUESTION (2) What are the power requirements for the RF Units? ANSWER (2) Both RF units (one for the DE UAV and the other for the DR/SUSS) have a power requirement of 12VDC Nominal. (can range from 11 to 16).  QUESTION (3) Is the Dragon Eye Display a standard VGA display? ANSWER (3) Current production/deployed DE UAV systems have an 8.4" 800x600 (! SVGA) screen.  QUESTION (4) While the Dragon Eye display is not part of this solicitation, would a MOWC that contained a 1024x768 VGA screen and supported HMD be acceptable? ANSWER (4) A 1024x768 VGA display is NOT part of this solicitation, while a HMD is part of the solicitation.  If 1024x768 VGA screen was to come with the MOWC, it would (1) be included as part of the weight requirement that is called out in the SOW, (2) have to be modular in design because while in DR/SUSS mode, a separate 1024x768 VGA screen is not required, desired, or needed, (3) add cost for a optional piece of equipment that is not requested in the solicitation. QUESTION (5) I have the impression that the software for this project is already complete and working on a windows 2K or XP system.  Assuming hardware compatibility is not an issue, is there any anticipated software engineering required? ANSWER (5) Software engineering is NOT required for this solicitation. QUESTION (6) Is there an ICD avail! able for the following?  ANSWER (6) The MOWC will interface to the RF components that operate Dragon Runner UGV, SUSS, and Dragon Eye UAV unmanned systems and meets the following systems specification as listed in 4.1.1 through 4.1.24.  An ICD is NOT required for this solicitation.  All applicable interface data has been provided either in the SOW or in this series of questions. QUESTION (7) Is there a preferred HMD type and/or manufacturer for this Program? ANSWER (7) No QUESTION (8) We have not received the referenced figures as stated in 4.1.4.  Can they be provided? ANSWER (8) As stated in the synopsis, under the description paragraph, "The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area; therefore, the synopsis/solicitation with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply.  Hard copies will not be provided. Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD!  Web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments."  The drawings can be found there. QUESTION (9) We require more detail on the interfaces in 4.1.16. ANSWER (9) USB and RS232 (for DR/SUSS hand controller and RF unit) technical details provided in question number 1.  Wireless LAN interface shall be 802.11g.  HMD and earpiece (audio) interface, as long as they are modular and removable, are up to the vendor to design. QUESTION (10) What is the physical interface desired for the optional keyboard called out in 4.1.24? ANSWER (10) The keyboard in 4.1.24 is OPTIONAL and NOT required.  However, since 4.1.16 calls out two USB interfaces, one of those USB interfaces could be used for the keyboard. The closing date for receipt of proposal has been extended as a result of these questions from industry.  Proposal must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. (Eastern time), 03 December 2004.  The cut off time for additional questions will be 4:00 p.m.  24 November 2004.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. 

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement for the conduct of Studies evaluating the effectiveness of various approaches for the delivery of educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The Studies will be conducted in cooperation and collaboration with the designated NICHD Project Officer (PO).

One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first six months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience, risk taking, or other factors (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) policies, now in place in most states, appear to reduce crash risks mainly by delaying licensure and possibly by reducing exposure to risk conditions.  One effect of GDL may be to increase parental management of teen drivers. With or without GDL, there appears to be great potential for increasing parental management of novice young drivers (Simons-Morton & Hartos, 2003).  

Previously, the PRB has developed, and evaluated in randomized trials, interventions designed to increase parental management of teen driving during the first year of licensure. This research demonstrated the efficacy of educational/behavioral interventions for increasing parental management of teen driving and reducing exposure to high risk driving conditions during the first 12 months after licensure (Simons-Morton et al., 2002, 2003, 2004, in press).  

The PRB's overall objective for the current requirement is to obtain reliable and valid data from separate studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to the delivery of educational interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The objectives of the individual studies are as follows: 
 
Study 1 (Persuasion):
Determine the most effective approaches, including their source, timing, content, and delivery, of persuasive communications designed to increase parental management of teen driving and reduce teen driving privileges.

Option 1:  Study 2 (Routine Licensing Practice):
Determine the extent to which educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving can be delivered effectively as part of routine department of motor vehicle administration driver licensing practice.

Option 2: Study 3 (Driver Education):
Determine the effect of educational/behavioral intervention to increase parental management of teen driving when integrated into driver education.

This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $6 million or less in annual receipts. For the calculation of annual receipts see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBA's Small Business Size Regulations.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement incrementally funded type contract, with a period of performance of 40 months, will be awarded for the initial Study as a result of the RFP.  It is also anticipated that the resultant contract will contain options for two additional Studies with periods of performance of 40 months each.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before December 8, 2004 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. 

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement for the conduct of Studies evaluating the effectiveness of various approaches for the delivery of educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The Studies will be conducted in cooperation and collaboration with the designated NICHD Project Officer (PO).

One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first six months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience, risk taking, or other factors (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) policies, now in place in most states, appear to reduce crash risks mainly by delaying licensure and possibly by reducing exposure to risk conditions.  One effect of GDL may be to increase parental management of teen drivers. With or without GDL, there appears to be great potential for increasing parental management of novice young drivers (Simons-Morton & Hartos, 2003).  

Previously, the PRB has developed, and evaluated in randomized trials, interventions designed to increase parental management of teen driving during the first year of licensure. This research demonstrated the efficacy of educational/behavioral interventions for increasing parental management of teen driving and reducing exposure to high risk driving conditions during the first 12 months after licensure (Simons-Morton et al., 2002, 2003, 2004, in press).  

The PRB’s overall objective for the current requirement is to obtain reliable and valid data from separate studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various approaches to the delivery of educational interventions to increase parental management of teen driving. The objectives of the individual studies are as follows: 
 
Study 1 (Persuasion):
Determine the most effective approaches, including their source, timing, content, and delivery, of persuasive communications designed to increase parental management of teen driving and reduce teen driving privileges.

Option 1:  Study 2 (Routine Licensing Practice):
Determine the extent to which educational/behavioral interventions to increase parental management of teen driving can be delivered effectively as part of routine department of motor vehicle administration driver licensing practice.

Option 2: Study 3 (Driver Education):
Determine the effect of educational/behavioral intervention to increase parental management of teen driving when integrated into driver education.

This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $6 million or less in annual receipts. For the calculation of annual receipts see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBA's Small Business Size Regulations.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement incrementally funded type contract, with a period of performance of 40 months, will be awarded for the initial Study as a result of the RFP.  It is also anticipated that the resultant contract will contain options for two additional Studies with periods of performance of 40 months each.

This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or before December 8, 2004 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, Contracts Management Branch, OAM, NICHD, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first six months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience (Williams & Ferguson, 2002), risk taking (Jonah, 1986), or other factors.  Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  

Research documenting the effect of passengers on driving performance has been based largely on analysis of databases of traffic crashes and injuries. Results indicate that, unlike experienced drivers, the effect of teen passengers is related to increased injury and accident rates for novice drivers. For example, Preusser et al. (1998) reported that for 16 year olds with two or more passengers present, the relative risk of being involved in a fatal crash was 7.86 times higher than drivers aged 30-59.  Rice et al., (2003) reported that teen drivers driving alone or with other teenagers in the vehicle were much more likely to be involved in a crash than adults. This may be due to increased risk taking, for example, as evidenced by higher average speeds and reduced gaps between vehicles (McKenna et al., 1998). Recent research efforts have also indicated a tendency for young drivers to be less likely to stop at an intersection during the yellow phase than either older drivers or as a result of having a passenger(s) present (Doerzaph, 2004; Mahoney, 2004; Steinberg, 2003).

Driving experience would appear to reduce teen driving risk (Williams, Ferguson, 2002), but no research trials have been conducted to assess the effect on objective measures of driving.  

The PRB’s overall objective for the current requirement is to obtain reliable and valid data to examine aspects of driving risks among novice teen drivers. The objectives of the individual studies are as follows: 

Study 1 (Experience):
Determine the effect of driving experience on the driving performance of teen drivers when newly licensed and again after substantial driving experience under normal, demanding, and distracted driving conditions (e.g., using electronic devices and in the presence of teen passengers) among males and females, and higher and lower risk taking/sensation seeking youth.

Option 1, Study 2 (Practice Driving): 
Determine the nature and extent of practice driving for newly licensed teens and determine the effect of greater and lesser amounts of supervised practice driving on the driving performance of newly licensed teens.

The required service is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement, incrementally funded type contract, with a period of performance of 36 months, will be awarded for the initial Study as a result of the RFP.  It is also anticipated that the resultant contract will contain an option for an additional Study with period of performance of 40 months.

<DESC>Summary:  The Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC), Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Department of Health and Human Services, is seeking comments from any interested parties to assist in planning a future public meeting that will provide a forum for constructive dialogue on the opportunities and challenges of Project BioShield implementation. Responses to this notice will be used to develop a meeting agenda that addresses the major areas of concern and enhances the productivity of the meeting.     

Dates:  Written comments must be postmarked, and electronic comments submitted by, January 31, 2005.

Page Limit:  Responses should be limited to three pages.

Address: Electronic responses are highly preferred and may be submitted to darrick.early@hhs.gov. Written comments may be sent to the attention of Darrick A. Early, Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, Office of Research and Development Coordination, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Avenue, SW, Room 624D, Washington, DC 20201. 

Background: To inform effective implementation of the Project BioShield Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-276), ORDC is organizing a future public meeting. The Project BioShield Act sets forth requirements for the acquisition of medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) through use of Project BioShield funds of up to $5,593,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2013. ORDC has the primary responsibility within HHS to enter into contracts with manufacturers for the acquisition of licensable medical countermeasures for the Strategic National Stockpile.  Additional information can be located at the following website http://www.hhs.gov/asphep/ordc/. Medical countermeasures acquired under Project BioShield will be a critical component of the Nation’s biodefense preparedness efforts. The public meeting will inform the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, medical and public health care sectors, university-based product development researchers, Congress and concerned citizens about the procurement and deployment processes under Project BioShield. ORDC is soliciting questions and comments from these parties during the planning stage to assist in developing a productive meeting agenda. Areas of special interest or concern will be targeted for discussion in either general or break-out sessions.

Response

Comments are sought from the perspectives of both potential future suppliers and future consumers of medical countermeasures. Please note that the Government will not provide individual responses to such comments.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP)
<SOLNBR>7000016
<RESPDATE>121304
<ARCHDATE>12132004
<CONTACT>Jennifer Warren, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4325, Fax 407-380-4164, Email jennifer.warren@navy.mil
<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando, Training Systems Division has a requirement to develop and implement new training curriculum courseware for Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) maintenance personnel by 2006.

The LCAC is a non-self sustaining, amphibious Air Cushioned Vehicle (ACV), used to transport up to 60-tons of equipment and/or troops, from ship to beachfront, at speeds in excess of 40 knots.  The primary mission of the LCAC is to conduct high speed, ship-to-shore, over-the-beach operations in support of Marine amphibious forces.  After being launched from the well deck of amphibious assault ships, the LCAC can transport equipment, personnel, and weapon systems to the beach from over-the-horizon standoff distances.  The original LCAC design was based on a 20-year life cycle.  Current vehicles are approaching the end of that service life.  A SLEP has been created to prolong the service life of all 91 craft for an additional 10 years.  During SLEP, all crafts will be updated to incorporate the latest performance, communications, and navigation enhancements, as well as meet new lift requirements.

The current maintenance-training pipeline includes the following courses: Propulsion and Lift System Maintenance, Gas Systems Technician Mechanical (GSM), Course Identification Number (CIN) K-652-0314, length 33 days; Craft Control Systems Maintenance, Gas Systems Technician Electrical (GSE), CIN K-652-0315, length 33 days.

Training on the new SLEP equipment is currently being conducted for previously qualified maintenance personnel.  Three courses are currently being offered.  Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Navigation (C4N) Maintenance, Electronics Technical (ET), length 10 days; Control Alarm and Monitoring System (CAMS)/Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) Operations and Maintenance, length 10 days; ETF40B 04 Level Engine Familiarization and Maintenance, GSE, GSM, length 5 days.

A Media Analysis is currently being performed on both legacy and SLEP maintenance courseware objectives to integrate both sets of courseware into a single continuum of instruction.  The results of the analysis will outline the new SLEP craft curriculum for maintenance training to include a concise list of course objectives with instructional sequencing and recommended media.  The output of the media selection will be provided to selected contractor as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to aid in course development.  The target audience for this new SLEP pipeline set of courses will be persons unfamiliar with the LCAC.

It is anticipated that a best value contract will be awarded to a contractor on or about May 2005 for development of a suite of courses (approximately 4) to comprise the LCAC SLEP maintenance-training pipeline.  These courses require use of a “blended solution” to include Computer Based, Instructor Led, Web Based and Hands-On training where appropriate, per result of the Media Analysis.

Course developed must conform to the following standards where applicable.
Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) and Integrated Learning Environment (ILE);
Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004;
Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS);
Navy and Marine Corps Internet (NMCI); 
IT21 – Shipboard standard

LCAC SLEP Technical Manuals are available for review on the Internet at http://www2.psnsbsn.navy.mil.

Potential sources must identify their business type (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc).  The responses will serve as a basis for the Government’s decision to establish this requirement as an 8(a), Small Business Set-Aside, or Unrestricted requirement.  NAICS Code 611430, small business size standard $6M will be used for this acquisition.  All information should be send via email to jennifer.warren@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods are via fax to (407) 380-4031 Attn: Mrs. Jennifer Warren Code 25331 or by mail to: Navair Orlando TSD, Attn Mrs. Jennifer Warren code 25331, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando FL 32826. All responses are due by 13 Dec 2004. The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists at this time. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, Mr. Jennifer Warren, via email at jennifer.warren@navy.mil or by phone (407) 380-4325.
PLEASE NOTE:  The primary source of information regarding this acquisition will be made available on the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities website, http://www.nawctsd.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm.   
Any resultant solicitation (including amendments, special notices, etc) will be posted exclusively at this web site.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The following information is provided to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to successfully support an H-1 aircraft Performance Based Logistics (PBL) product support strategy, and to exchange ideas with industry on how best to implement an H-1 aircraft PBL program. The U.S. Marine Corps H-1 Upgrades program is a remanufacture of legacy aircraft to increase payload, power, endurance, and range.  The program incorporates state of the art designs into the existing fleet of AH-1Ws and HH/UH-1Ns, converting them to 180 AH-1Zs and 100 UH-1Ys, respectively.  The upgraded aircraft will have several common systems such as: four-blade main and tail rotor systems; hinge-less and bearing-less main rotor system; updated drive train systems; crashworthy seats; and modified landing gear. The AH-1Z and UH-1Y will also have an integrated cockpit display to provide enhanced navigational reliability and accuracy, and a Helmet Mounted Display System that is compatible with all cockpit avionics and will improve weapons delivery.  The original equipment manufacturer and prime contractor for the H-1 Upgrades Program is  Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. The H-1 Upgrades program is currently in the later stages of the engineering and  manufacturing development (EMD) phase.  Low Rate Initial Production was approved in Oct 2003, with the first production aircraft delivering in FY 06. H-1 aircraft operate from Marine Corps Air Stations (MCAS), Navy ships, and improved and unimproved airfields, worldwide.  The H-1 maintenance concept is three levels of maintenance (organizational, intermediate and depot) in accordance with OPNAV Instruction 4790.2.  O-level maintenance is performed by USMC personnel that have custody of the aircraft/equipment (inspecting, servicing, lubricating, adjusting, and replacing parts).  I-level maintenance is performed by designated maintenance activities for direct support of organizational activities (calibration, repair or replacement of damaged or unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies).  D-level maintenance is performed on material requiring major rework or a complete rebuild of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and end items, including manufacture, modification, testing, and reclamation of parts as required.  The Navy/Marine Corps H-1 aircraft have been designated as a Joint Chiefs of Staff planning scenario aircraft.  Accordingly, as delineated in Title 10 USC Sec. 2464, H-1 depot maintenance must be performed at a Government owned and operated facility, by Government personnel.  For depot level maintenance, public/private partnership is the required approach to meet Title 10 USC core logistics capability requirements.  Except for the depot work covered under Title 10, the above scope of work is notional in nature.  As such, innovative approaches to providing a broad based support package that is efficient and embraces continuous process and product improvement, is being sought, to optimize the life cycle support provided to the Navy/Marine Corps forces operating H-1 aircraft, worldwide. To provide a more cost-effective readiness solution for the entire H-1 Upgrade program, PBL support is being considered for all H-1 AH-1Z and UH-1Y aircraft, and peculiar support/test equipment.  PBL is a support strategy that places primary emphasis on optimizing weapon system support to meet the needs of the Warfighter.  Its primary tenets are documentation of Warfighter performance requirements as measurable metrics in Performance-Based Agreements (PBAs), designation of single point accountability for performance with a Product Support Integrator (PSI), and development of support metrics and accompanying incentives to ensure that the performance objectives are met.  In short, PBL is buying Performance, not transactional goods and services.  PBL delineates performance goals of the weapon systems support infrastructure, ensures that responsibilities are assigned, provides incentives for attaining these goals, and facilitates the overall life-cycle management of system availability, reliability, supportability, and total ownership costs.  PBL is an integrated acquisition, engineering, and logistics process for buying weapon system support. Some of the areas of interest are described below:
Product support integration and management.  Establishment of a single point of accountability for managing and integrating all support elements being provided for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and peculiar support/test equipment. Technical data support and management.  Management of recorded information of scientific or technical nature i.e. technical maintenance and operator manuals, engineering drawings, and supporting graphics; in addition to the implementation of a long-range requirement to develop, deploy, and maintain Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs). Support and test equipment.  Life cycle support and management of all peculiar support and test equipment (hardware & software) required for the operation and maintenance of the weapons systems. This includes ground handling and maintenance equipment, tools, metrology and calibration equipment, and other test equipment. Maintenance planning.  Establishment and update of maintenance concepts and requirements for the life of the system, and the development and implementation of a plan for improving reliability, maintainability and life cycle supportability, i.e. levels of repair, repair times, testability requirements, support equipment needs, obsolescence management, projections, and resolution, technology insertion, manpower skills, facilities, organic and contractor mix of repair responsibility, etc. 
Manpower and personnel.  The identification of personnel (military & civilian) requirements, i.e. skills and grades required to operate, maintain, and support systems over their lifetime.Training and training support.  Processes, procedures, techniques, training devices, and equipment used to train personnel to operate and support a system. Design interface.  The relationship of logistics-related design parameters to readiness and support resource requirements, i.e. design for supportability, effective operation and maintenance, etc.
Supply support.  Management actions, procedures, and techniques necessary to determine requirements, to acquire, catalog, receive, store, transfer, issue and dispose of spares, repair parts, and supplies. The process includes provisioning for initial support, as well as acquiring, distributing, and replenishing inventories.  This effort includes establishing a business relationship with the organic designated rework points for depot level maintenance and repair.  Supply chain management is the function of supplying materiel and logistics services to USMC units throughout the world. Packaging, handling, storage, and transportation (PHS&T).  Combination of resources, processes, procedures, design considerations, and methods to ensure that all systems, equipment, and support items are preserved, packaged, handled, stored, and transported properly. Facilities.  Management of real property assets required to support a system, including studies to define types of facilities or facility improvements, location, space needs, environmental requirements, and equipment. Configuration management (CM).  Manage the process for establishing and maintaining consistency for a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design and operational information throughout its life.  The CM element includes product (system, hardware, software, firmware) associated data and documentation including, but not limited to, information associated with: requirements, functional performance, design, test, drawings, plans, and procedures and maintenance or operational documentation. 
Sustaining engineering and logistic support.  Provide engineering and logistic support commensurate with the quantity and complexity of the aircraft, aircraft systems and associated peculiar support equipment.  This effort includes technical support for quality deficiency reports, configuration changes, technical publication deficiency reports (TPDR), engineering investigations, etc. The Marine Corps’ vision of a highly maneuverable, highly flexible, decentralized operational force requires a similar approach to logistics - an adaptable, flexible, and responsive logistics system. Companies interested in responding to this request for information should mail the following: a company pamphlet, brochure, or short statement of the company's abilities/history with this type of service, the name and telephone number of a company representative that can be contacted, and the company's address.  Once responses are received, interested parties may be requested to provide a presentation to further describe their capabilities and allow an opportunity to exchange ideas on how best to provide cost-effective performance based outcomes for the H-1 aircraft.  Written responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<DESC>The NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is issuing this Request for Information to solicit early industry participation and identify potential sources for the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) System Network Replacement Project. (Also see "Attachment" to this synopsis) NASA/GSFC has been operating and maintaining ground-based laser ranging systems since the early 1960's.  The SLR systems track cube corner-equipped satellites by making time-of-flight measurements utilizing short pulse laser transmitters and photomultiplier tube-based timing receivers.  The SLR data collected by Goddard's network is used in numerous earth science studies as well as providing support for ongoing orbital missions where precision orbit determination is required.  Current systems have reached the performance limits for both data quality and quantity while the demand for precision tracking data continues to grow.  The next generation replacement SLR system must employ new ideas, instrumentation, philosophies, and techniques to provide accurate, reliable, 24/7 tracking operations at greatly reduced costs.  Through a competitive process NASA plans to replace the existing SLR Network with new automated systems that address these issues and that retire the electrical, chemical, ocular, and toxic fume hazards existing on current systems.  NASA/GSFC currently has a prototype system (SLR2000) in development. The primary goals of prototype development is to evaluate single photon detection SLR systems operating at kilohertz rates, to demonstrate enabling key technologies, ideas and instrumentation, and to determine system hardware, software, and control algorithm performance levels and limitations.  NASA/GSFC is interested in receiving information from industry to plan the procurement of the next generation Satellite Laser Ranging System Network.  The SLR Network is expected to consist of eight to twelve systems which will be deployed globally.	While the exact locations of the network have not been chosen yet, it is expected that the current NASA SLR system locations will be used, and that additional sites will be near existing facilities that can supply power and communication.  The SLR systems will be expected to communicate in real-time to a Central Facility (not included as part of this RFI) which will coordinate and monitor the Network's performance.	The new SLR system supplier will be required to demonstrate interim subsystem performance at the factory as well as system verification and performance assessment at the final location.	Acceptance will be at each system's final location.  (Also see "Attachment" to this synopsis for further information) All respondents are asked to submit a brief SLR system description including technical approach and risk assessment; a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the SLR system design, build, deployment, testing and training; an estimated time schedule for completion and delivery of up to 12 SLR systems; and an indication if you would be willing to bid on this as a fixed price contract.  Respondents are also asked to submit capability statements, relative past experience, and any literature, brochures, and references necessary to support their ability to meet or exceed the stated requirements. All responses must be received by no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time (EST), on December 22, 2004.  Both written and electronic submissions are acceptable.	Fax submissions will not be accepted.  All written responses to this RFI shall be submitted to NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, ATTN: Regina Williams, Code 210M.4, 8800 Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD  20771.  All electronic responses shall be submitted to regina.a.williams@nasa.gov. (See "Attachment" to this synopsis for further instructions) This Request for Information is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.	This is not a solicitation for proposals and in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  All respondents are solely responsible for any and all expenses associated with providing information in response to this notice.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the results of the Government's evaluation.

<DESC>Introduction:The Department of Homeland Security’s Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate (FEMA) operates a Telecommunications Services Center (TSC) that is the main administrator for wireless communication services within FEMA.  The purpose of this office is to maintain current inventory and billing detail on each wireless device within FEMA.  DHS/FEMA is seeking comments and information on the availability of pertinent billing management software. Purpose: The purpose of this document is to obtain information on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) telecommunications billing management software solutions.  Information is requested on products that would enable DHS/FEMA to access accurate cost and billing data available on wireless communication devices (i.e. cellular phones, pagers and Blackberries).  The following sections outline the problem and specific information that respondents are requested to address.  Information obtained in this RFI will be utilized in analyzing the applicability and cost effectiveness of a telecommunications billing software solution.  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government use of such information.  Respondents of this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Statement of Problem & Guidance: 
DHS/FEMA’s TSC currently maintains all pertinent billing information concerning wireless telecommunication devices using a proprietary software system.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) Only.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to replace our Trailerable Aids to Navigation Boat (TANB).  The TANB  is the workhorse for most Aids to Navigation Teams (ANTs).  TANBs are used to provide rapid discrepancy response in semi-exposed and protected waters, and to service aids located in shallow water.  ANTs have primary responsibility for 22,115 aids or 62% of the federal aid total.  The current TANBs were built between 1980 and 1992 with a projected service life of 7 years.  They have not only reached but also surpassed their useful service life.  Some TANBs have been renovated to extend their service life for an additional 5 years.  Even those only have a few years of operational life left before they too need replacing.  The intent of the TANB replacement project is to capture the lessons learned from the U.S. Coast Guard’s (USCG) use of the TANB, capitalize on the advances of boat design and manufacture as well as make use of the latest technology to provide our ANTs with the most capable, dependable and reliable resource to conduct the Short Range Aids to Navigation (SRA) mission.  The attached document contains the DRAFT requirements for this RFI. Please submit all information in response to this Request for Information to Ms. Jennie Peterson, 2100 Second Street, SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001; (202) 267-2523.  Documents less than 20 pages may be sent electronically to jpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil.  The deadline for submission for all information in response to this RFI is 7 December 2004. The attached document contains the DRAFT requirements for this RFI. ****

<DESC>Dynamic Networked Combat Capability	
This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested sources by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) regarding Dynamic Networked Combat Capability. 

DARPA does not intend to award any type of award instrument based on responses to this RFI, or otherwise provide compensation for the information solicited. Any information submitted in response to this RFI is provided voluntarily. 

This RFI is open to any capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to universities, private or public companies, Government Laboratories, and Government research establishments. Respondents are advised that DARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this Request for Information (RFI).

DARPA may issue a formal Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Dynamic Networked Combat Capability in the future, but nothing herein obligates DARPA to do so. DARPA may invite responders to present their solutions prior to the release of any anticipated BAA to discuss expediting these technologies, as may be applicable.

Objectives and Description of Dynamic Networked Combat Capability:
The objective of a Dynamic Networked Combat Capability is to allow individual deciders, sensors and weapon systems to form arbitrary and spontaneous confederations to accomplish a mission, independent of the platforms and independent of the communications available to each decider, sensor or weapon. The capability would focus on the real-time dynamic aspects of combat and not on planning activities or on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities. 

Technologies are desired that can provide a “web based” service to enable constituents to: 
1) Discover the availability of deciders, weapons or sensors; 
2) Discover the existence and position of targets, and 
3) Collaborate to assign specific decider/sensor/weapon sets to targets. 

These technologies would enable the virtual rapid deployment of forces because any weapon or sensor systems, from any of the services, on land, air, maritime or space platforms, would be able to rapidly confederate to form ad hoc force packages to immediately attack targets on land, in the air or on the sea. This capability would enable the most immediate application of US military forces more rapidly than what could be achieved using predisposed sets of decider/sensor/weapon configurations that are limited by command interface and data link restrictions.

This capability would enable concepts such as automatic counter attacks which could be executed when friendly systems are under attack; the counter attack prevents the hostile system from continuing its attack. The technology would also apply to the evolving concept of Littoral Warfare. The Littoral Warfare concept is conducted by coalition Naval and Marine elements and supported by coalition Army and Air Force elements.

The notion of a confederation rather than a federation implies the need for flexibility and adaptivity. In federated systems, the capability to acquire, exchange, and employ information is generally based on predefined agreements, protocols, a data context and semantics. The information needs of each decider, sensor and shooter are predicted well in advance of the mission timelines, albeit tailored to the constituents. The communication interfaces are similarly predefined and assigned although the actual communication paths may be dynamically assigned. Thus, even though information flow for the deciders, sensors and shooters appears to be interconnected in a network-centric manner, in reality, the decision-architecture, information flow logic, and the network applications are based on the traditional hierarchical paradigm. 

Information sought:
System concepts and ideas for innovative technology are sought in areas such as:
•	Concepts and technology for distributed, autonomous assessment and assignment of targets to decider, sensor, and weapon packages that account for the target identification requirements and weapon effects needed to defeat the target
•	Concepts and technology for temporary assignment of authorities to the decider, sensor and weapon in a package
•	Concepts and technology for enabling deciders, sensors and weapons to communicate over a heterogeneous communications network comprised of various communications sub-networks. The communications services must be assured and not “best effort”.

Instructions to Responders:
Responders should provide a high-level description of their solution or technology that will fulfill the objectives for this program.  Responses consist of an executive summary that is no longer than five pages in length and one additional, non-proprietary page that identifies the responder’s technical and administrative points of contact, to include name(s), address(es), phone(s) and fax numbers, and email addresses.  Responses may contain any appropriate and necessary backup information to support the executive summary.  Reponses should be marked with appropriate proprietary markings, such as "Company Proprietary." Markings like "Company Confidential" or other phrases that may be confused with national security classifications shall be avoided. 

The Government anticipates that responses to this RFI will be unclassified. In the event that an RFI response may be classified, contact DARPA/ATO at (703)526-4777 for full instructions on how to prepare and submit your response. 

Responses should be submitted in a commonly used electronic format via email to DNCC@darpa.mil. Responses that cannot be submitted electronically may be delivered to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington VA 22203-1714, Attn: Dynamic Networked Combat Capability RFI Manager, ATO. Responses are due no later than 4:00pm, Arlington, VA Local Time, 15 December 2004

<DESC>Bechtel Nevada is seeking General Contractor sources that can provide for the design and construction of the following facility at the Nevada Test Site, Area 6, Mercury, Nevada.

One facility with options of motor driven wheeled vehicle or linear motor powered carriage are envisioned.  Consists of a straight-line track of seller’s design approximately 100 meters long passing between loading-dock-height portal mounting platforms (designed and installed by others).  The facility will include a bi-directional carriage capable of carrying a softball sized radioactive source from 0.25 feet to 16 feet above the platform surface on a mast with a maximum source weight of ~2 kg.  It will be capable of transporting the radioactive source at controllable speeds past multiple sensors (by others) with the source installed at variable vertical heights.  No change of source height is required during carriage motion.  The carriage will be capable of remote computer-controlled and pre-programmed speed and direction.  Velocity capability is from 1 m/s to 2.2 m/s within ± 10% for current standard with capability to travel at 15.6 m/s for future standards tests.  Stated in other units, the speed must be adjustable from slow walking speed (~2 miles per hour) to 35miles per hour.  Carriage should repetitively run the following cycle:  Accelerate to chosen speed in a minimum distance, maintain that speed for 30 meters centered on the test platform, decelerate in a similar distance, reverse and repeat the process in the opposite direction.  Sensors capable of determining the speed and height of the source on the moving carriage and delivering that information with time stamping to a stationary data collection point are to be included.  Life operating and maintenance cost will be a consideration.

****Any resultant subcontract will require the contractor to be signatory to Bechtel Nevada Project Labor Agreement for Construction.  This agreement can be found at the following site:  http://www.bechtelnevada.com/ppmgt/const_main.htm****

It is anticipated the formal Request for Proposal package will be issued in January 2005 to pre-qualified sources.

INTERESTED PARTIES WISHING TO PRE-QUALIFY FOR RECEIPT OF A PROPOSAL PACKAGE WILL BE EVALUATED BY SUPPLYING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BELOW LISTED EVALUATION CRITERIA NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 15, 2004.

<DESC>The Jacksonville District is conducting a market survey to identify qualified small businesses to coordinate the implementation of a large-scale monitoring program for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).  The CERP provides a blueprint for restoring the south Florida Everglades ecosystem, while providing for other water-r elated needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection.   The CERP includes a program known as Restoration Coordination and Verification  (RECOVER) that is designed to provide high quality scientific and technical support and to implement the applied science strategy, which outlines a process for organizing scientific information.  RECOVER is responsible for the coordination and application of the adaptive assessment approach that will be used during the implementation of CERP to gage project performance and implement required adjustments.  This adaptive assessment program includes a system-wide Monitoring and Assessment Plan (MAP) that is de signed to support the goals and objectives of CERP.  The purpose of the MAP is to determine how well the CERP is meeting its goals and objectives and to identify opportunities for improving performance.  The goal in implementing the MAP is to develop a sin gle, integrated, system-wide monitoring and assessment plan that will be used and supported by all participating agencies and tribal governments as the means of tracking and measuring the performance of the CERP.  The MAP consists of over 100 different bio logical, hydrological, and water quality monitoring components.  Due to the size and complexity of the MAP, a determination has been made to obtain contractor assistance for MAP implementation. The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 541620 with a  size standard of $6.0 million for potential small businesses.  Any interested small  business concerns are advised of the language in the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting paragraph (b)(1) which states  that under a small business set-aside contract for services at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  Therefore, the Capabilities Statement should realistically demonstra te how the small business concern would be able to comply with this clause which would be included in any potential contract.  Please also note that consultants are considered subcontractors and not employees of the prime contractor. Interested small business concerns that believe they have the capability of providing services as defined above are invited to submit, in writing, a Capabilities Statement with sufficient information within a 15 page limitation.  Respondents to this market survey should provide their capabilities/expertise in the following areas: (1) managi ng large-scale monitoring and assessment programs; (2) quality assurance/quality control for large-scale programs; and (3) data management and reporting across multiple entities and resource issues.  Particular emphasis should be placed on any experience i n the above categories specifically involving ecosystem restoration and expertise in South Florida ecosystems.

<SUBJECT>D--Medical Occupation Data System (MODS) follow-on acquisition effort.  Updated tool  against existing MODS platform, to track medical readiness for Army and medical training and deployment data for the medical force.
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-05-R-MODS
<RESPDATE>121704
<ARCHDATE>02152005
<CONTACT>John Norway, 703 325-3332
<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal. PURPOSE: of this Request For Information (RFI) is to solicit industry feedback to assist in the development of the acquisition strategy for the Medical Occupation Data System (MODS) follow-on acquisition effort.  The purpose of the acquisition is to award a new contract to a vendor who can provide an updated tool placed against the existing MODS platform, which tracks medical readiness for the Army and the medical training and deployment data for the medical force. BACGROUND:  MODS is a system developed in increments over the past 12 years by an incumbent Contractor to meet specific information needed by the Army. The system and programming belong to the government; however the incumbent contractor has rights to the intellectual knowledge gained in the development of this system and is free to employ that knowledge for other government agencies.  It began strictly as a personnel data system and evolved to a multi-task, multi-compo meaning both active and reserve syste m that draws data from multiple sources and essentially  fills in the gaps most notably the information requirements discovered during recent deployments and with the Army transformation that existing systems do not cover.   	As new technology, new information requirements and new training become available; the Army Medical Department ( AMEDD)  requires a system that is easily adaptable to track those new elements.  For instance, after the RC mobilization after 9-11, many pati ents were held over on active duty pending medical treatment and evaluation.  Many patients were well enough to be discharged from the hospital, but needed further treatment or evaluation.   Housing, feeding and managing their care quickly overwhelmed the local installations.  The AMEDD needed a system that could track and expedite management of their care quickly.  MODS was the vehicle of choice.    ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:   SCOPE:  MODS is a system that  shall be web based and accessible world wide.  The medical readiness of the entire Army is tracked and posted through MODS.   MINIMUM THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS: Have Single Interface access through Army Knowledge Online (AKO) Interface Army and Department of Defense (DOD) standard database systems to enhance analysis and decision-making.  Interface critical medical human resource information to the Tri-service Defense Medical Human Resource System (DMHRS) of the future.  Interface and standardize AMEDD-unique automated systems and databases to interact with other systems within MODS.  Automate and interface AMEDD-unique manual systems and databases to interact with other systems within MODS.  Provide an integrated automation system to support life cycle (accessions, promotions, training, pay, transition) human resource management decisions.  Develop and maintain a manpower/personnel database at the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), as outlined in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD-HA) Health Manpower Personnel Data System (HMPDS) Directive.  Conduct Assessments and research proposals to develop new subsystems that are required within MODS Change Management- Receive input from the MODS users to develop, change or modify functions as needed. ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL:   http://www.mods.army.mil  (The current system web site) CURRENT SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The deployment and training of the medical force is managed and tracked in MODS.  Currently there are several modules in MODS: Personnel Module which tracks data on the AMEDD force world wide across all 3 compos.  The Government is looking for a web-based system that provides an easy access, web based solution that allows customized queries of data from multiple sources.  A specia l function must exist to track deployment information and identification of the Professional Fillers (PROFIS) who during non-deployment work in a treatment facility but are con sidered part of a MTOE unit for deployment purposes.  Accuracy in this area ensures equitable deployment and retention of medical skills within the force.     A sub task of the Personel  Module is the Special Pay Subsystem that adds an analysis capability for determining budget requirements for AMEDD Incentive Special Pays for over 7000 medical, dental, and nurse professionals and non-medical professionals am ounting to over 220 million dollars.  Medical Material Mobilization and Planning Tool (M3PT) which is a data dictionary and programming guide for AMEDD.  The successful contractor will have a viable plan to provide programming maintenance and troubleshooting support separate from the Help Desk  and be able to provide program manager assistance with the plan for marketing of program.    Command Management System (CMS) The Office of The Surgeon (OTSG), Decision Support Center (DSC) requires the design, development, maintenance, and sustainment of a data warehouse, and web-based presentation layer with integrated charting capabilities to tr ack and display performance metrics for the Army Medical Department senior leadership using the red, amber, and green stoplight reporting methodology.  Army Medical Department Medical Holdover/Active duty Medical Extension (MHO/ADME) this function must be able to interface with multiple systems i.e. MEBITT system per agreement in Systems Interface Agreement (SIA) and populate existing fields with data ava ilable within those databases; the Physical Disability Agency (PDA) data in MODS.  This system must create Executive Report for OTSG weekly for units both FORSCOM and Other MACOMS.  The system must be able to track soldiers of all Compos, and provide track ing as the patient progresses thru the Medical system.  The successful contractor will design a system that tracks each stage of the process and alerts case managers when someone is not progressing and provide reports in both a canned format for routine re ports and allow ad hoc reports to easily be generated and read on standard Microsoft software.  MEDPROS is the Army database of record for Immunizations (IMM) and Individual Medical Readiness (IMR), and is the single definitive data source for commanders at all levels in determining the medical readiness status of their units.  MEDPROS tracks IMM an d IMR data for all Army components, deployable civilians, contractors and others as directed, and makes that data available to users worldwide as needed.    Significant MEDPROS Tasks: DATA INPUT: Provide multiple modes for capturing data throughout the world.  Modes must include direct data entry via Internet site and remote entry via stand-alone software application.  Stand-alone application must work across multiple hardware platforms  and operating systems to include PC, Pocket PC and Tablet PC.  Data transfer to the central database must be via direct synchronization (i.e., not via email or FTP).  Each data element must be tagged/trackable to the individual who entered the data and wh en the data was entered.   INFORMATION OUTPUT: Provide timely, accurate medical readiness reports to authorized users throughout the world via Internet access.  Reports must be fully scalable, searchable and sortable by the user in terms of data and scope. Access Management: Provide a system for managing user data access and data write privileges.  The system must provide a user access to those areas of data to which he or she has been granted access with a single sign-on from Army Knowledge Online and/or PK I/CAC token. Data Storage: Data will be stored on Internet servers of sufficient capacity and speed to allow users to add data and access data for reporting in real-time without mass data uploads/downloads.  The server system must meet current .net specifications.  It must have sufficient redundancy to withstand partial system failures. INTERFACES: MEDPROS must interface with other Army and DoD information systems bi-directionally as require d.  MEDPROS must be capable of receiving/sharing IMM/IMR data from other systems (for example, CHCS2 DEERS, etc) and providing data to other systems (for example, TAPDB ,DARTS ) as required.  In certain cases, MEDPROS must be able to integrate data from ot her Army databases (i.e., TAPDB, AFIP AMSA.  Interfaces will be formally delineated. USER TRAINING:  MEDPROS training will be Internet based.  It will be fully interactive.  There will be multiple levels of training (reports, data entry, and administrator).  Successful completion of on-line training will be a prerequisite for access.  On-l ine training will be comprehensive for the corresponding level of access and will be self-paced.  USER SUPPORT:  MEDPROS help will be available 24/7 via Internet feedback.  A help desk will be maintained 24/7.  This may be consolidated with other MODS help desk functions. REGIONAL COORDINATORS/TRAINING ANALYSTS:  MEDPROS will staff MEDPROS coordinator positions at the following locations:  NARMC; SERMC; GPRMC: WRMC; PRMC; ERMC; Korea; Ft. Bragg; Ft. Campbell; Ft. Benning; Ft. Stewart; Ft. Hood; and Ft. Carson.  AMEDD Resource Tasking System (ARTS) application is designed to provide its users with a real time, worldwide system to manage the tracking of medical personnel.  The system has the ability to track a task from inception at MEDCOM, thru the selection of a n individual that will fulfill a specific requirement, as well as create the deployment order for that individual.  The main goals for ARTS are to give:  Users a viable candidate that is able to fulfill a requirement;  Advance notification to a soldier of an impending requirement for which they were chosen to fill; RMC, MSU, or Unit a tool to analyze their historical data;  Advance notification to Units of the possibility of losing a soldier to an impending task.  Interfaces required to maintain the 91W Tracking Module and its subsystems are: Total Army Personnel Data Base -Officer, Enlisted, and Civilian (TAPDB) and the internal MODS PROFIS system. The 91W MOS requires an extensive training program to maintain thei r medical qualifications.  The IT solution must provide a means to verify the training and certification of those skills. 90 Day Boots on the Ground (90 Day BOG):  The U.S. Army Medical Department has the responsibility for sourcing, tracking, and recording Reserve Components' (RC) Medical Corps, Dental Corps, and Nurse Anesthetist officers. At this time the current 90-day Ro tator Module does not capture or report required data needs. This modification of the Personnel functional area will enhance the readiness of the units affected by the 90-day rotator policy. Operational success depends on the synchronization between requir ements, resources, and reporting. This mission has been assigned to MEDCOM to facilitate coordination with FORSCOM, USARC, HRC, NGB, and other source providers. The current automated report system and its capabilities to track those activated soldiers does  not meet the current needs for an Army wide common visible input and tracking database system.  91W TRACKING APPLICATION: The 91W tracking is a web-based application for managing 91W MOS transition and certification sustainment. The basic requirements are two-fold. The tracking system is a powerful tool for generating reports that display information  about 91W transition.  As AMEDD soldiers complete their transition to 91W, this application will capture all the details of sustainment for a unit, location, command, or individual.  Reports may be exported to Excel for further data manipulation. The syst em is also an easy to use interface for data input of transition and sustainment requirements for an individual or a group of individuals. Interfaces required to maintain the 91W Tracking Module and its subsystems are: Total Army Personnel Data Base -Enlis ted, Guard, and Reserve (TAPDB), the National Registry for EMT Certification (NREMT) and the Army Training Requirements and Resource S ystem (ATRRS). ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES: Award of a performance based contract to the best value industry team providing the most innovative and cost-effective solutions. ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT:  The successful offeror will play a significant role in creating the IT Solution and risk assessment tools. The Government will consider both new and existing system designs in both software and underlying hardware platforms to p rovide a high quality product.  As soon as possible after contract award, a successful vendor must be able to provide an integrated stable platform to solve the AMEDD requirements.  The government can not afford a delay or disconnect between current applic ation and the new or revised solution.  Daily actions must continue during the development and testing of all new applications. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:  The successful offeror will have significant responsibility for the continued development and refinement of the IT Solution. The Government seeks help in identifying user needs, back-end business application needs, and overall functi onal enhancements.  The Government also seeks the establishment of strong processes to formalize the development and facilitate the prioritization of improvements. PERFORMANCE-BASED:  Proposals will be solicited using performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Performance Work Statement approach for defining the requirements, and a Performance Requirements Summary with incentives or disincent ives for not meeting the PWS acceptable quality level under each task area.   TERM:  The contract term is anticipated to include a base period of one year, with a yet to be determined number of option years. QUESTIONS:  The Government is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the solicitation package: 1. What is the best type of contract to manage this system and the evolving requirements? 2. What measures and metrics would you suggest for evaluating the solution and performance? 3. What specific detail or additional information is needed in order to propose on this requirement? 4. What contractual incentives or disincentives would motivate outstanding performance?  In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized? 5. How do you propose ensuring the interoperability of the proposed solution with army and tri-service applications/processes? 6. What additional data do you require to design and develop a workflow tool to facilitate an authorization/issuance capability? 7. If this specific scenario should arise, what is a reasonable timeline and the types of skill sets required for transition to a new contractor?   8. Do you have any suggestions on how to conduct the transition?   9. Any lessons learned from transitions you have participated in that would assist in ensuring a smooth and apparently seamless transition? 9.  How do you propose to comply with data security and privacy requirements? 10. What do you propose as meaningful performance metrics for the success of the overall new project? 11. How far into the future are you willing to commit your company to support this requirement?  12.  The Government currently owns the servers, the data and the programming in MODS. Do you recommend that the Government continue with this approach or do you have other suggestions for a more technologically efficient and in the near-term more cost-effe ctive approach? SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:  Responses to this RFI will be in the form of a White Paper, not to exceed ten (10) pages, with an optional Microsoft Power Point briefing, including notes, not to exceed ten (10) slides.  Submit responses, via e-mail, to John Norw ay at John.Norway@itec4.army.mil not later than  Close of Business 17 December 2004.

<SUBJECT>COLLECTIVE PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY READINESS ASSESSMENT
<DESC>The Joint Project Manager’s Office for Collective Protection (JPMO-CP), a project office within the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is requesting information on new and innovative technologies currently available for evaluation for various collective protection (CP) acquisition programs and activities.  The list of CP efforts, including CP integration into various platforms, includes the Joint Expeditionary Collective Protection program (JECP), the Joint Collective Protection Equipment program (JCPE), the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle program (EFV), the Future Combat System program (FCS), the Littoral Combat Ship program (LCS), and various fixed site CP programs.  The Government’s intent is to evaluate selected technologies and utilize the results to advance our systems to better meet warfighter needs. Smaller, lighter equipment needing less logistics support has been identified as critical warfighter requirements.  Additionally, CP systems must address the broad chemical, biological, and radiological (CBR) threat spectrum, which includes traditional and non-traditional chemical and biological warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs).  To meet these objectives, the program office is seeking technologies that can provide significantly enhanced capabilities over currently fielded systems. Specific capability improvements sought include reduced system and component footprint, volume, and weight; reduced power consumption, increased protection performance against chemical (including TICs), biological, and radiological contaminants; reduced setup and tear down requirements (time, manpower, equipment resources); increased personnel entry and exit rate to and from a toxic free area (TFA); and reduced logistic support measures (increased service life, service life indications, reduced maintenance, etc.). Products and technologies being sought include, but are not limited to, novel and alternative air purification processes, new and improved chemical adsorbent and particulate filtration media (including regenerative strategies) that can be integrated into existing single pass CBR filter assemblies, CBR barrier materials for use as CBR resistant tentage, liners or other enclosure systems that can provide a TFA, quick implementation collective protection equipment and processes, advanced contamination control area and airlock technologies that integrate current decontamination processes, and complete packaged collective protection solutions. Proven mature technologies or unique integration of existing systems that can address any of these capability enhancement areas are being sought for evaluation. Beginning with this sources sought announcement, the government will collect information from interested parties, first in the form of a brief technology overview followed by a detailed white paper. Based on the detailed white papers, selected technologies will be briefed in-person. A final down select will occur to identify those technologies to participate in the ColPro Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE) event to be start in late summer of 2005.  The submitters of these select technologies will receive the TRE reports and technology readiness level (TRL) designations for their submissions only.  Under the ColPro TRE program, the DoD will only fund the testing and evaluation deemed necessary to meet the objectives of the ColPro TRE.  The cost of the submitted equipment/technology any associated development effort! s, and any unique test preparation will be at the expense of the submitter or other government funded program.  Equipment provided to the DoD TRE program may be retained for disposal by the Government following test and evaluation if it is determined that the equipment presents a hazard due to live agent testing conducted as a part of the TRE.   All travel and shipping costs including return shipping will be paid by the vendor. The project office is seeking mature technologies.  These are technologies that have demonstrated through experimentation and prototyping, the basic scientific principles behind the technology, the technology concept, and the ability to scale up for the needed application.  The ColPro TRE testing will be developed to provide a TRL assessment of six (6) or above.  TRL six (6) is defined as a system prototype demonstrated in a relevant environment while TRL seven (7) is defined as a system prototype demonstrated in an actual environment.  Therefore, prototyped or fully developed products are required for the technology to receive full consideration for ColPro TRE participation.   Technologies that provide solutions for multiple areas will be valued higher than those addressing only specific issues.  Additionally, technologies that will introduce significant logistic support measures for fielded operations will be avoided.   To submit a technology or integration approach, interested parties should submit a brief expression of interest with an overview of the technology by email no later than 15 January 2005 using the email address: COLPROTRE2@nswc.navy.mil.  This submission should be no longer than two (2) pages of the standard 8.5 by 11 sheet size.  Detailed white papers will be due in March 2005.  The white paper format, content, and submission details, and exact due dates will be published via an update to this announcement in early January 2005.  Notionally, the white paper should detail the technology concept, proposed benefits and capability enhancements, experimental data, development history and status, and technology maturity level (i.e., notional concept, breadboard/lab setup, demonstration prototype, off-the-shelf, etc.).  Participants should consider the nature of the threats, the environment and application of the technology, and the concept of operations to be used with the technol! ogy.  It is also critical for the submitter to discuss and defend the stated maturity level of the technology.  After evaluating the detailed white paper submissions, the project office will request in-person technical briefings from selected submitters.  The final ColPro TRE event participants will then be chosen.  Selected participants for the ColPro TRE event will be notified in Spring 2005.  The intent is to select proven, mature, and applicable technologies that are immediately ready for evaluation. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.   EXPRESSION OF INTEREST:  Submit a brief expression of interest with an overview of the technology via email no later than 15 January 2005 to the email address: COLPROTRE2@nswc.navy.mil.   DETAILED WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS:  Detailed white papers will be due in March 2005.  The white paper format details and exact due dates will be published via an update to this announcement in early January 2005.   QUESTIONS: All questions and comments should be emailed to COLPROTRE2@nswc.navy.mil.  Responses to inquiries will be made through reply emails within two business days.

<SUBJECT>B--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON PLANNED APPROACH TO RESOLVE VAB DETERIORATED SIDING
<DESC>This is a “Request for Information (RFI)” only.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking industry comments on the current planned approach to resolve the VAB deteriorated siding problem.  This is an opportunity to suggest alternative materials, technology, and/or construction techniques that would result in lower cost than the current planned NASA approach. This RFI is for information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.  NASA will review all comments/suggestions received but shall be under no obligation to respond to industry comments or to incorporate any comments/suggestions into any resultant drawings and specifications. NASA intends to develop a final design (drawings and specifications) for the repair of the VAB.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  Overview: The VAB was built in 1965 to support the Apollo program.  During the recent hurricane season, many of the VAB envelope wall panels were damaged; some were completely removed; some had only failures of the panels’ outer skin.  Areas of the VAB that were severely damaged included aluminum panels and translucent fiberglass panels. NASA has consulted with experts who specialize in risk mitigation, material testing, structural investigation, analysis and design, wind loading and wind tunnel testing to assist in developing the drawings and specifications included for review in this RFI.  As a result of these consultations the following preliminary drawing and specification packages have been generated and are provided electronically for your review/comment: 1:  VAB Siding Installation Details Drawing 79K36086 2:  VAB Siding Specification 79K36159 3:  VAB Siding Addenda to Drawing and Specification The following plan is considered the most cost effective solution to replace/repair panels and increase the siding panels’ capacity to resist wind loads beyond the original design with the goal to meet, as close as is practical, current code requirements for wind loads. 1.	Reuse all white colored aluminum panels higher than ~ 40 feet above ground level (this means that 55% of the entire building existing aluminum panels will be reused).  In addition upgraded fasteners will be installed in order to increase the exterior siding negative wind pressure resistance.  Note: the white-colored aluminum panels exhibited little or no corrosion at the fasteners.  2.	Replace all charcoal-colored and silver-colored aluminum panels.  Additional upgraded fasteners will be installed in order to increase the exterior siding’s negative wind pressure resistance.  Note: the charcoal-colored and silver-colored aluminum panels exhibited moderate to heavy corrosion at the supporting fasteners.  The corrosion appears to be due to deterioration of the rubber sealing washer at the fasteners and the resulting water infiltration as well as dissimilar metal contact. 3.	Replace all translucent panels.  Note: translucent panels are deteriorated and have exceeded their service life by more than 20 years.    Building Properties:  Feature Property (approximate) Height	525 feet Length	718 feet Width	518 feet Aluminum Siding 1,090,000 square feet (~60% white; 40% charcoal & silver Translucent Siding	66,000 square feet Site Tour: A site tour will be conducted on Thursday, December 2, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. (see details below).  There will be only one site tour offered. Anyone who plans to attend the site tour must give 48 hour written notice to the responsible Contract Specialist, Mitch Colvin.	The following information should be faxed to his attention at 321-867-1166 or 321-867-2042: Full Name (as it appears on your driver’s license) Social Security Number Company Name and Address Attendance is limited to three representatives from each interested firm.  Attendees MUST BE US Citizens.  Attendees must show a picture ID. Attendees will pick up badges at the Pass and Identification Building Section (PIDS) on the NASA Causeway near U.S. 1 and will ride a bus from the PIDS to the VAB.  Area access badges will be picked up as a group at F-gate. Cameras are permitted. Information Being Requested: Name, Company Name and brief background of experience and field of interest. Comments/Suggestions and brief history of success (why is suggested approach/materials appropriate).  Provide brief, discussion and comments.	Alternative approaches (materials, fasteners, coatings, installation techniques, etc.) shall include detail describing why and how the alternative approach can meet the desired requirements at a lower cost to the Government.  Product information will not be returned.  ALL INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE GOVERNMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND CAN AND WILL BE USED AND/OR RELEASED AT THE GOVERNMENT’S DISCRETION.  FOR THIS REASON, RESPONDENTS TO THIS RFI SHOULD NOT INCLUDE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION IN THEIR RESPONSE. Responses Due: Responses to this RFI are due no later than Friday, December 10, 2004.	All interested parties should send their response via an official letter to NASA/John F. Kennedy Space Center, Attn:  Roy M. (Mitch) Colvin, Code:  OP-ES, Kennedy Space Center, FL  32899.  Questions should be directed to: Mitch Colvin, 321-867-3415.

<SUBJECT>--Network Sciences International Technology Alliance
<DESC>The U. S. Army has been exploring mechanisms of improved research collaboration with the UK (and other allies) that would better involve our respective industrial and academic communities. Based on this experience, and noting our joint national commitment with the UK to increase the mutual value of collaboration, we are currently involved in preliminary discussions with the UK Ministry of Defence on a new bilateral cooperative technology con cept called an International Technology Alliance (ITA).  We envision that this would bring together government, industry and academia in tackling some of the fundamental science underpinning the complex information network issues that will be such a vital facet of future coalition military operations.  Fundamental research is sought in network theory, network security for highly mobile ad hoc networks, sensor and information fusion, and distributed coalition decision making.   Officials from both nations are currently exploring the ITA concept, with an aspiration to release detailed information early in 2005. Subject to national approvals, consortia of industry and academia from both nations will then be invited to propose in co nnection with the program. During the U S Army Science Conference being held at the end of November, 2004, (www.asc2004.com), US and UK representatives intend to make a broad statement concerning the joint aspirations for the program. This announcement is to make interested organiza tions aware of this potential initiative and to encourage involvement in this opportunity.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.
