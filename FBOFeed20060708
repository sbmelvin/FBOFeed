<SUBJECT>L -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH, Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) Security Non-Guard Services
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - MARKET RESEARCH SURVEY TO VALIDATE SCOPE AND GROUPING for CNIC Security Non-Guard Services.  Conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION NOTICE.  The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil),  is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing security non-guard services activities throughout the Continental United States, Hawaii, and Guam.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the security non-guard services activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Commercial & Other Than Commercial Vehicle Inspections (entry control point, non-interdiction), Mobile Vehicle Inspections (non-interdiction), Drug and Explosive Detection Dogs (non-interdiction), Pass and Identification, Dispatch and Intrusion Detection System/Closed Circuit Television Monitoring (including Security, Fire, Emergency Medical, and Emergency Management), Court Administration Services, Armory and Ready for Issue, Security Training, Physical Security, Supply/Logistics, General Administration, Crime Prevention Program, Surveillance Detection (in a surge, non-interdiction capacity), Harbor Patrol Barrier Maintenance, Abandoned Vehicle Impound, and Traffic Control.  Excluded from the scope are inherently governmental law enforcement activities, security guard functions which may not be contracted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2465, and final signature/approval of developed policies, procedures, plans, budgets, etc. which are inherently governmental.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Billet Titles and Count by Installation.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.  General information regarding the Regions and Installations set forth in Attachment 1 is available via the CNIC website at http://www.cnic.navy.mil/Regions.htm.
The initial work breakdown structure (WBS) grouping of activities (which is set forth in Attachment 2A discussed below) is primarily based on the Navy’s Facility Support Contract/Base Operations Support (FSC/BOS) Template which provides a common framework for Navy-wide performance-based contracts and which aligns with the Navy’s Installation Management Accounting Project (IMAP) Core Business Model (CBM) and Cost Accounting Codes (CAC).  Additional information regarding the nature of the initial scope and grouping activities may be obtained by referring to the following publicly available directives and instructions:  OPNAV Instructions 3440.17, 5530.14C, 11200.5C, 5585.2B, 5580-1A, 3591.1D, 5560.10B, 5530.13C ; SECNAVINST 5822.1B and 5530.4C; and DOD Directive 5525.4.

Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Market Research Questionnaire and associated Attachment 2A, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Scope and Grouping and Attachment 2B, CNIC Security Non-Guard Past Performance History no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 21 Jul 06.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Laurie Cordell, at laurie.cordell@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Cordell at 843-820-5621.  YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS MARKET RESEARCH ENDEAVOR IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ASSISTING CNIC IN MAKING THE BEST COMPETITIVE SOURCING DECISION.

Participation is voluntary; respondents will not be paid to participate.

Small business sources will be considered in this research.

NOTE: This is to advise any commercial source providing information as part of this market reseach process that your information will NOT be used later as part of the evaluation process should you choose to submit a proposal in response to any solicitation that may result in the future.

A contract will NOT result from this market research. One or more separate solicitations for the services described herein MAY be issued in the future.

The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil),  is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President’s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing security non-guard services activities throughout the Continental United States, Hawaii, and Guam.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the security non-guard services activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Commercial & Other Than Commercial Vehicle Inspections (entry control point, non-interdiction), Mobile Vehicle Inspections (non-interdiction), Drug and Explosive Detection Dogs (non-interdiction), Pass and Identification, Dispatch and Intrusion Detection System/Closed Circuit Television Monitoring (including Security, Fire, Emergency Medical, and Emergency Management), Court Administration Services, Armory and Ready for Issue, Security Training, Physical Security, Supply/Logistics, General Administration, Crime Prevention Program, Surveillance Detection (in a surge, non-interdiction capacity), Harbor Patrol Barrier Maintenance, Abandoned Vehicle Impound, and Traffic Control.  Excluded from the scope are inherently governmental law enforcement activities, security guard functions which may not be contracted pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2465, and final signature/approval of developed policies, procedures, plans, budgets, etc. which are inherently governmental.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Billet Titles and Count by Installation.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.  General information regarding the Regions and Installations set forth in Attachment 1 is available via the CNIC website at http://www.cnic.navy.mil/Regions.htm.
The initial work breakdown structure (WBS) grouping of activities (which is set forth in Attachment 2A discussed below) is primarily based on the Navy’s Facility Support Contract/Base Operations Support (FSC/BOS) Template which provides a common framework for Navy-wide performance-based contracts and which aligns with the Navy’s Installation Management Accounting Project (IMAP) Core Business Model (CBM) and Cost Accounting Codes (CAC).  Additional information regarding the nature of the initial scope and grouping activities may be obtained by referring to the following publicly available directives and instructions:  OPNAV Instructions 3440.17, 5530.14C, 11200.5C, 5585.2B, 5580-1A, 3591.1D, 5560.10B, 5530.13C ; SECNAVINST 5822.1B and 5530.4C; and DOD Directive 5525.4.

Interested parties are requested to complete and return via email the Attachment 2, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Market Research Questionnaire and associated Attachment 2A, CNIC Security Non-Guard Services Scope and Grouping and Attachment 2B, CNIC Security Non-Guard Past Performance History no later than 4:00 PM Eastern, 21 Jul 06.  E-mail responses should be sent to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Ms. Laurie Cordell, at laurie.cordell@navy.mil.  If you have questions concerning this RFI, please contact Ms. Cordell at 843-820-5621.  YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS MARKET RESEARCH ENDEAVOR IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ASSISTING CNIC IN MAKING THE BEST COMPETITIVE SOURCING DECISION.

Participation is voluntary; respondents will not be paid to participate.

Small business sources will be considered in this research.

NOTE: This is to advise any commercial source providing information as part of this market reseach process that your information will NOT be used later as part of the evaluation process should you choose to submit a proposal in response to any solicitation that may result in the future.

A contract will NOT result from this market research. One or more separate solicitations for the services described herein MAY be issued in the future.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

										
SOLICITATION: HSCG80-06-Q-3FAN49		                              DATE:  23 JUNE 2006

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 13.501(a) Sole Source Acquisitions, the following facts and rationale are presented:

	(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition.” – U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT), Naval Engineering Division, Vessel Procurement and Logistics Branch, Norfolk, VA, hereby presents this justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

        	(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. – This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition seeks approval to contract with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Mattei Compressors Incorporated located in Randallstown. MD. Request approval to proceed with this sole source acquisition, for a firm fixed-price contract for the purchase of eleven Air Compressors, Model C350.  These compressors are used on the 130-CGB class 130’ Aides to Navigation (ATON) Barges.  The contract is a one time purchase using simplified acquisitions procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. 

	(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value). – The primary function of this unit is to supply high pressure compressed air to power deck equipment onboard the barge.  This equipment is used to assist cutter personnel with the retrieval and placement of critical ATON markers in the inland river system.  The compressor is directly coupled to a Cummins 145 HP, Model 6BT5.9 by way of a power take off unit manufactured by Twin Disk.  The existing compressor, engine and fire pump skid was designed and assembled by Cummins, then delivered to the Coast Guard as a single unit during barge construction in the early 1980s.  The compressor and fire pump must have similar characteristics relative to the engine’s capabilities.  This requirement is essential to mission capability of the U.S. Coast Guard’s WLR fleet.  The quantity is 10.  

	(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. – Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302.1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

	(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. –The necessary manufacturing data are proprietary and controlled by Mattei Compressors Incorporated.  The data was not procured for the Air Compressors and therefore was not available for release to generate competition.

   	(6)  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether an EPS notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2, and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. – In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for Air Compressor, Model C350 will be advertised in the Electronic Posting System (EPS)/FedBizOpps as a combined synopsis/solicitation under streamlined acquisition procedures for commercial items utilizing FAR Part 13.5.

	(7)  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. – It is the Contracting Officer’s opinion that prices for the procurement will be fair and reasonable based on price analysis, prices charged other customers and price paid for similar items.  Additionally, prices will be compared to quotes received from resellers.

	(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. – A sources sought notice was issued June 8, 2006 to identify sources capable of providing the Mattei Model C350 Air End Compressor.  Sources sought:  8a, HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concerns.  One response was received, from Mattei Compressors, Inc., a small business concern.   
  
	(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc. – A detailed analysis was conducted November 1997, by CDI Marine Company, to evaluate the market and identify a suitable replacement compressor.  This analysis evaluated the products of all the major manufacturers of low-pressure high volume compressors and compared their products using five primary characteristics (i.e. Driver, Output, Cooling, Safety, and Installation Space Envelope).  This analysis concluded that the Mattei Air Compressor, Model C350 was the only piece of equipment being manufactured that would meet service needs and be compatible with the existing system without extensive reengineering of the barge systems.  Consideration of any other manufactured component would not be cost effective because it would require more funds to redesign and reengineer the complete unit requiring replacement of primary components.

	(10) A listing of the sources, if any, which expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. – This JOTFOC is being processed concurrently with the EPS combined synopsis solicitation which incorporates the pre-solicitation notice.  If responses to the solicitation indicate sources available, the file will be documented accordingly and all quotes will be considered.

	(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. – The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor did they purchase the data as part of the initial system acquisition for the Air Compressor, Model C350 to foster a competitive procurement effort.  Complete specifications and drawings are not available and the cost to procure them is not easily quantifiable.  As a result, it would be difficult to foster competition, as the Coast Guard does not have adequate technical descriptions of the manufacturing, performance and acceptance data for the Air Compressor.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 333912.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  This is an unrestricted procurement.  This procurement is a sole source set aside.  The purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items as a firm fixed price purchase order for brand name equipment.  The USCG intends to procure 10 each air end compressors, Model C350 from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Mattei Compressors, Incorporated.  The required delivery date is October 31, 2006.


Mattei Compressors Incorporated or a source capable of providing the OEM's equipment.  The award will be in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements (see attached Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition).  The equipment is approved for use on the 130-CGB class 130’ Aides to Navigation (ATON) Barges.  The Coast Guard does not own nor can it provide specifications, plans, drawings or other technical data.  The unit price shall include f.o.b. destination.  The contractor will be responsible for shipping charges.  Quotes will not be considered unless f.o.b. destination is quoted.  Delivery will be made to

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair 
and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was 
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and 
time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is 
empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General 
Accounting Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast 
Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest 
with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their 
concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or 
Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast 
Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to 
the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the 
concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for 
Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend 
contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time 
requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a 
timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the 
Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and 
solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency 
protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the 
contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are 
unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, 
the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be 
suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in 
writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best 
interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 
calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at 
FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling 
of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within 
the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program 
should be forwarded to the address below:
