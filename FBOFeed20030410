<DESC>Oral Health expertise and capacity within State health departments are instrumental to coordination and collaboration among local health agency programs.  CDC believes that resources devoted to oral health can be allocated more efficiently and effectively if they address locally defined priorities and, through statewide collaboration, are carefully designed to coordinate individual needs within a comprehensive plan for the community.  These collaborations allow a broad spectrum of public and private educational, dental behavioral, social, not-for-profit, and health-care financing agencies to become involved with developing community-based solutions to the oral health problems that have been identified.  To help State Oral Health programs identify successes and share lessons learned, it is important to assist them with the evaluation of their programs.  This project is designed to build capacity within State Health Departments for evaluation.  CDC expects to build on the evaluations of programs (coalitions, dental sealants, etc) in the future to assist other states with their oral health programs.  Award of a firm-fixed price purchase order, using acquisition for commercial items/services procedures, is contemplated.  The order will include the following periods of performance: Base Period---12 months from date of award; Option Period---12 months from date of successful completion of the base period and exercise of option to add this option period.  Three additional options to include three additional states may be exercised at any time during the life of the project.  This RFQ is a total Small Businesses set-aside.   CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to the RFQ.  All questions/concerns about the RFTQ shall be submitted via e-mail to BBiltz@cdc.gov.   The tentative issue date is April 25, 2003.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued.  No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed.   The associated NAICS codes are 621210 and 54199 and the small business size standard is $6 million.

Basic Qty: 2 First Articles; 27 Production Units. Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ): 30 Production Units.  Option I: 1-89 Production Units. Option II: 1-89 Production Units.  
This is a competitive requirement with an Insurance Policy Buy for the MEQ to the proven source, BAE Systems, Yonkers, N.Y. 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Award of MEQ): The Government has determined that a break in the supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units' mission capability. Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that first article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part. Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award the MEQ and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source. In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives.  
The approximate solicitation issue date will be 7 Feb 03, with the approximate response date of 7 Mar 03.  Request solicitation from Don Howard, WR-ALC/LNKB, 265 Perry St, Robins AFB, GA, 31098-1607; email don.howard@robins.af.mil.  Solicitation will be posted on the Web at http://pkec.robins.af.mil.

Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the MEQ.  See Note(s) 22, 26.

<DESC>NAVICP-Mechanicsburg plans to contract for thirteen various, 7 cog repairable stock numbered items on a fixed price basis by issuance of a modification to existent Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract, N00104-00-D-ZD21, awarded Mar 2000 for the Close-In-Weapon-System(CIWS) with Raytheon Missile Systems Corp (RMSC)-Tucson, AZ. The contract expires Jun 2005.  All items are CIWS unique and were recently back transferred from the Defense Logistics Agency where they were managed as 9 cog consumables.  Sufficient levels of stock are being transferred by DLA for 8 of the 13 items thereby precluding any repair or manufacturing efforts by RMSC or the actual vendor.  Most  forecasted actions are repairs.  One item only will be totally supported via vendor repairs.  The balance of 4 items are RMSC in-house repairs.  Only one item, sole source to RMSC, requires an inventory augmentatio n via manufacturing on a very limited basis.  Although various Acquisition Method Codes apply to the 13 various items, RMSC only has the ability to successfully  integrate  procurement, repair, testing, Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMS) issues, configuration changes and reliability upgrades necessary to complete major assemblies and critical components.  Adequate specs and drawings are not available for any of the 5 items requiring inventory actions.   RMSC shall function as the Government’s Commercial Stock Point for these spares in support of Navy, US Coast Guard requirements and all Foreign Military Sales customers including the performance of all routine inventory management functions including receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling.  The goal is to improve the availability and reliability for the CIWS while simultaneously reducing overal l support costs.  The projected modification award date is late  May 2003.  The 5 items requiring repair or manufacturing actions are: 7H 5998-01-163-8618, PN 5186611, linear actuator 7H 3950-01-176-9683, PN 5187637, hoist beam 7H 6110-01-188-8017, PN 5190985, magnetic contactor 7H 5998-01-126-5166, PN 6123051, circuit card assy (CCA) 7H 5998-01-466-8536, PN 7044701, CCA  The 8 items not requiring repair or manufacturing actions are: 7H 5998-01-157-6032, PN 5188282, CCA 7H 4420-01-162-8778, PN 5187783, heat shield 7H 5998-01-164-9926, PN 5190197, CCA 7H 5998-01-187-5187, PN 5187068, CCA 7H 1285-01-197-9827, PN 5942866, suppressor assy. 7H 5998-01-230-8424, PN 5543282, CCA 7H 5999-01-231-5122, PN 6166736, CCA 7H 5998-01-231-5123, PN 6166734, CCA Contact Point, Bill Wolfe, NAVICP M0213.18, ph (717)605-2191, fax (717)605-7317  Reference #  CIWS PBL 13 ADD-ON

<DESC>This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). This BAA is also listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). I. INTRODUCTION. The Radio Frequency (RF) Sensors  Division of the AvionicsDepartment of NAWCAD Patuxent River, Maryland is soliciting  proposals for research in technologies that are applicable to RF Sensor Systems for Navy aircraft. II. BACKGROUND. The RF Sensors Division continues developing advanced systems and technologies for Naval Aviation. Many areas of application include SyntheticAperture Radar, Multi-function Radar, advanced antennas, image & data   
processing, and communications. The RF Sensors Division continues to develop advanced capabilities to reduce the cost of transitioning technology into the Fleet.  III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. This BAA is to solicit technical/cost proposals for research support in technologies that are applicable to Radio Frequency (RF) Sensor systems for Navy Aircraft.  Major areas of interest include: (1)Signal Processing (2)  Antennas and Propagation (3) Information Processing (4) Devices and Materials (5)Radar and RF Communications Systems Engineering Methodologies and (6) Aircraft Installation Technologies. New, innovative and creative approaches to technical problems that significantly advance radar and RF Communication system performance and improve aircraft installations are sought. Among the primary interest areas are AEW radar operating at UHF through L band and S-band, tactical radar operating at C, X, and Ku bands, synthetic aperture radar operating in X-, C-, L-, and UHF-bands, and C3I systems operating at any radio frequency throughout the spectrum. Examples of technologies include, but are not limited to, antennas, antenna array concepts, electronically scanned arrays, conformal arrays, radomes, propagation, scattering, and diffraction, rough surface scattering, computational electromagnetics (with emphasis on antenna design and antenna-platform interaction), phased array antenna concepts, electronically scanned arrays, devices and materials, remote sensor telemetry and miniaturized RF telecommunication transceivers, optical components/fiber optics, 
photonics and monolithic microwave integrated circuits, high power broadband T/R modules and associated subassembly/device technologies, direct digital synthesis exciter concepts, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) techniques for circular arrays, massively parallel processing architectures for multi-channel STAP, software engineering, advanced signal processing of synthetic aperture radar data, advanced image processing, data and image exploitation, moving target imaging techniques, automatic target recognition and classification, advanced signal processing concepts for multi-mode sensor operation, and equipment installation techniques solutions.  IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAWCAD is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under authority of 10 
U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided  by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Amy M. German at (301)342-5738 or by e-mail at germanam@navair.navy.mil. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it 
shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.  V.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. No Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Submit proposals in two (2) phases.  PHASE I - White Papers Submit 
three (3) copies of a two (2) to three (3) page White Paper at any time during the above stated open period. The White Papers will be evaluated (at a minimum) quarterly.

The White Papers shall be submitted to the attention of Amy M. German at the  following address: Department of the Navy, Attention 2.5 Contracts Bldg 588 Ste 2, 47253 Whalen Road Unit 6, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1463. Contents of White Papers may also be submitted electronically to germanam@navair.navy.mil. Confirmation of receipt is recommended for electronic submission. If interested, the Navy will contact the offeror for additional information and/or a Phase II Proposal (See paragraph B below.)  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS: Registration in the DoD's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award resulting from this BAA. For more information please contact the CCR Assistance Center at 1-888-227-2423. PHASE II  Full Proposal General Information: Only Offerors whose Phase I - White Paper is considered capable of meeting Program   requirements will be asked to submit Phase II - Full  Proposals. REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF A FULL PROPOSAL  DOES NOT GUARANTEE  AWARD SELECTION. Proposals shall be submitted in original, with the signature of an authorizing official, with three (3) copies to the address noted above. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Historically Black Colleges and
Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBZone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to  participate. Submit Full 
Proposals in two (2) volumes;  VOLUME I - TECHNICAL  PROPOSAL, not to exceed twenty-five (25) pages, should include the following three sections:  Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief 
technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the 
technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms  the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD). VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals 
are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance. Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown
of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the  particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, 
equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used  for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors' cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? Section 3 - Cost 
to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. The offeror shall present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about
the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements.  VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to 
any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement. The merit of the proposal shall be determined based on the following criteria listed in order of importance: (1) The Offeror's ability to 
demonstrate feasibility and potential contributions of the effort to DOD priorities in RF Sensor related technologies;  (2) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; (3) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; (4) Proposed cost, adjusted for cost realism; (5) The Offeror's past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the  effort; and (6) Socio-economic merits (contracts only). For awards to be made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the extent of commitment in  providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small businesses, HUB zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service disable veteran-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions (HBCU/MI).  
VIII.  AWARDS. NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves
the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the
Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal  will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small 
disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>The Surveillance Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the Cherokee Nation, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for a contract, for a two-year period plus two one-year options, to continue capacity building for a cancer registry for the American Indians residing in the 14-county Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdictional Service Area (TJSA) who are eligible for health care through Tribal or Indian Health Service (IHS)-operated health care facilities.  Currently the number of eligible users is approximately 100,000. The ultimate goal of the project is the establishment of a population-based cancer registry, to be called the Cherokee Nation Cancer Registry, that will meet the standards of the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program in case finding, patient follow-up, data processing, data reporting, and quality assurance by February 14, 2007.  At that time the contract may be extended to maintain the registry at  SEER standards.  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer among American Indian populations of the United States.  With the data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer rates among this group.  It is expected that the Cherokee Nation shall share costs for the establishment of the registry and assist in the development of agreements with the hospitals, clinics, pathology laboratories and other entities where data on American Indian cancer cases can be obtained.  The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22 is included and reads as follows:   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of  publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The work includes Architectural and Engineering Services necessary for the preparation of plans, specifications, and construction cost estimates ready for bidding for construction of the Agile Chemical Facility at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Maryland.  This project will provide the Navy with a continuous nitration plant that is capable of manufacturing a variety of nitrate esters at variable throughputs between 1000 – 100 kg/hr.  This project consolidates the capabilities of two nitration plants into one plant by replacing the existing antiquated nitration facilities and modernizing others to provide flexible, variable quantity production of nitrate esters used in the manufacture of propellants and explosives.  Elements of this project include a new nitration plant, with a transport system, additional equipment to provide for recycling the spent acid and a wastewater treatment capability.  This Agile Chemical Facility shall be constructed to manufacture nitrate esters.  Construction shall include a new control building for remote process operation, tanks, and containment structures.

Preference will be given to firms with the demonstrated capability of using CAD, SPECSINTACT, and the Success Cost Estimating System.  Each firm's past performance(s) and performance ratings will be reviewed during the evaluation process and can affect the selection outcome.  Firms that meet the requirements listed in this announcement, are invited to submit one copy each of the completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and SF 255, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated below.  Site visits will not be arranged during the advertisement period.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis.  Interested firms are requested to include telefax numbers, DUNS number, and Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 255 and SF 254 in Blocks 3 and 1, respectively.  Interested firms are also requested to include their A/E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) number on the SF 255 in Block 3.  In Block 10, state why your firm is specially qualified based on the selection evaluation criteria.  Also, use Block 10 to provide additional information desired by your firm.

Fax and electronic copies of the SF 254 and 255 will not be accepted.  This is not a request for proposal.  Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  The small disadvantaged business set-aside goal in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5% of the subcontracted work.  This set-aside goal of not less than 5% also applies to women-owned small business concerns.  This does not apply if the prime firm is a small business concern.  Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are now required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to receiving a contract award.  This data base provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.

<DESC>Subject: EA-6B MISSION REHEARSAL TRAINER (MRT) PHASE II

Description:  

The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Electronic Warfare Associates, Inc. (EWA) 13783 Park Center Road, Herndon, VA 20171.

Electronic Warfare Associates, Inc. was tasked under Contract N61339-01-C-0002 to develop a prototype Mission Rehearsal Trainer (MRT) that integrated the EA-6B Weapons Systems Trainer (WST) Device 2F178 core emulation software with the EA-6B Unique Planning Component (UPC) software that is being developed by Northrop Grumman PRB Systems (NGPRB) under a separate contract.  The MRT prototype developed by EWA contains three software modules. The 3-D control panel simulations which is the operator interface to the tactical software, the 2F178 core tactical software emulations, and the Electronic Warfare Simulator (EWS) that performs all calculations required to generate the threat environment related to platform movement and emitter characteristics as determined by NGPRB’s EA-6B UPC software.  The MRT prototype is now developed.  The MRT and the UPC prototypes possess highly complementary and synergistic capabilities that greatly enhance the ability of EA-6B aircrew to first plan (using UPC) and then rehearse a mission (using MRT), and then modify the mission plan (using UPC) based on the lessons learned during rehearsal (using MRT).  Also, EWA developed the device 2F178, including the flight and tactics stations. 

The purpose of the new contract is to modify MRT software from its current prototype status of Operational Flight Program (OFP) 1.1 to Block 89A OFP 2.0, which will make the MRT compliant with the EA-6B OFP 2.0 UPC standards.  This will further advance the EWS module to perform all calculations required to generate the threat environment related to platform movement and emitter characteristics as determined by the EA-6B tactical mission library data, commonly known as the “after bubble” library. This will provide the appropriate release version for distribution to EA-6B fleet assets.  This effort will include the tactical software updates associated with OFP 2.0.  Additional enhancements under this effort include upgrading the 2F178 tactics station software to be compliant with the Block 89A OFP 2.0 release.  Existing RDSI “EWPro” scenario generation software will be replaced with software that increases functionality by improving the flight characteristics model to provide a smoother operation of the tactical station flight instrumentation during independent mode of operation, enabling the importing of missions and emitter data from Data Storage Memory Unit (DSMU) or Raymond Recorder Set (RRS) tapes and also allowing for the import of missions and emitter data from the EA-6B tactical mission library data.  

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1.0	BACKGROUND 
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate within salt-laden environments.  This condition accelerates the corrosive attack to the HU-25’s leading edge slats.  Over the years the slats have been cannibalized and repaired several times.  Repaired slats do not meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM’s) critical profile and contour dimensions for fit to aircraft which contributes to excessive labor hours during installation.  History shows that a complete disassembly of HU-25 slats is necessary for thorough inspections, which commonly require outer skin replacement.  Slats are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  In order to maintain better configuration control, the Coast Guard has assigned and labeled slats with unique Coast Guard part numbers reflecting complete slat assemblies (see ARSC Control Drawing 925-267).
2.0	OBJECTIVE

A.	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair/overhaul and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 slat assemblies.  Repaired/overhauled slats must meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal trimming and adjustment during slat installation.  In addition, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated during repair/overhaul. 
	The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair for leading edge slats.  First, a “baseline repair” would be required for slats that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or impact damage. This would require skin replacement and hardware.  Second, “overhauls” would be required for slats that also exhibit significant wear and/or internal corrosion.  The offeror shall provide a cost break down for items above and beyond a baseline skin replacement.  At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror's technical and cost proposal.  Offeror’s may propose additional levels of service.

The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited, required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, non-serviceable slat storage, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul slats.
	The offeror’s responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center’s (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  
B.	To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 
1.	Technical
a.	Provide detailed work specifications for slat baseline repair and overhaul
b.	Provide a written Performance Metrics plan TO INCLUDE INCENTIVES AND DISINCENTIVES THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO METING OR EXCEEDING MISSION CRITICAL PERFORMANCE METRICS.
c.	Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard
d.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling and fixtures to meet the OEM’s critical profile and contour dimensions per the OEM drawings listed in paragraph 3.0.
e.	Provide separate price breakdowns for slat baseline repair and overhaul
	Note: The Coast Guard considers a baseline repair as replacement of slat skins and required hardware to make complete slat assemblies.  An overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes replacement of internal assemblies and costly cannibalized components (i.e. bearing and rail supports, internal structures, rails, movable rib assemblies, etc.)
2.	Past Performance  
a.	Provide documentation for having performed repair/overhaul of similar or like items
b.	Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.

§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance.  E.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.
 

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor’s actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation of proposed price/cost

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to include the Questions and Answers for Solicitation FA4416-03-T0023 as follows: On 3-4 Apr 2003 the following questions were received from various Contractors regarding the site visit and subject solicitation. 1.(Question)Reference Requirement (F), does the Air Force want all guy anchor pads excavated and inspected? If guy anchor excavation to the pad is desired, is it acceptable to just excavate to the area where the anchor exits the concrete or do they wish an entire face exposed. Excessive excavation could affect the guy anchors and tower structural integrity. (Answer) Excavate to inspect anchor-to-anchor pad exit point only. Exposure of entire face of anchor pad is not required. Perform this inspection on two anchors per antenna. This should be a good sampling number. 2.(Question) Are all of the guy anchors placed into concrete? (Answer) Unknown. 3.(Question) Reference Requirement (B), is inspection of the top surface of the concrete tower pedestals sufficient for purposes of this RFQ? (Answer) Inspect exposed surfaces and excavate to 12” below ground, by hand. Be aware of ground rods and rings close to pedestals. 4.(Question) Determination of Ultrasound. Will we consider the amount to be tested at 10% randomly per tower? (Answer) 10% random is acceptable. 5.(Question) Determination of torque testing. Will we consider the amount to be tested at 10% randomly per tower? (Answer) 10% random is acceptable. 6.(Question) Anchor foundation excavation. Since the anchors are the strength of the tower I recommend that we not excavate these. We perform a visual inspection. There was talk of an ultrasound test. The hand held unit for testing the steel is a different unit than what will be required to perform a ground penetrating ultrasound to the anchor foundations. Do you wish for us to continue with this mindset? (Answer) Excavate to inspect anchor-to-anchor pad exit point only. Exposure of entire face of anchor pad not required. Perform this inspection on two anchors per antenna. This should be a good sampling number. If ultrasound tests can produce the same result as above mentioned visual inspection they may be performed. 7.(Question) Foundation excavation. Can we assume the excavation to be limited to1'? (Answer) Yes. 8.(Question) Will you require onsite facilities? (Answer) Access to site compounds is not available. Contractors must provide toilet and water for personnel and a cell phone must be on site in case of emergency.9.(Question) Will you be releasing a bid sheet or should we work off the clin's? (Answer) Please work off the CLINS as follows: CLIN 0001 Safety Inspection QTY:1 Unit Price$_______________;Extended Amount$_______________; CLIN 0002 Inspection Reports QTY:1 Unit Price$_______________;Extended Amount$_______________;Total Amount$_______________; Print Name_______________________; Signature/Date_____________________ 10.(Question) Prevailing wage determination. The prevailing wage information for this location describes "Iron worker" as Structural or Reinforcing. Since this is an inspection at this point neither description fits appropriately. How do you interpret this? (Answer) It appear that the Telecommunication Mechanic I $19.41 and Telecommunication Mechanic II $20.45 may be appropriate. However, if necessary, it’s the contractor’s responsibility to contact the Department of Labor to confirm the appropriate wage rate.11.(Question) Will the contract allow us to tension guy cables and alignment prior to climbing the structures? Allot of the guy cables appeared to be under tensioned, and would be a safety issue for climbing personnel. (Answer) Contractors are permitted to take necessary steps to ensure the safety of personnel. 12.(Question) Are the towers to be relamped? With contractor furnished lamps? (Answer) No. 13.(Question) Are drawings available for the towers? (Answer) SCMK does not have drawings for individual towers. Towers are basic Rhon towers. 14.(Question) Are the guy anchors to be excavated for inspection? To a depth of 1', 2' or 4'? (Answer) Excavate to inspect anchor-to-anchor pad exit point only. Exposure of entire face of anchor pad not required. Perform this inspection on two anchors per antenna. This should be a good sampling number.

National Forest land in the project area has significant amounts of spruce tree mortality, breakage & blowdown caused by the spruce bark beetle epidemic in southcentral Alaska, with many of the dead spruce trees already jackstrawed on the ground.  The Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area is classifed as being located in a wildland urban interace for the purpose of hazardous fuel reduction because of it’s close proximity to residental structures in the community of Sunrise.  There are no private structures within the fuel reduction unit in this Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project area. 

The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) & supplies to perform the following work in the Hope Highway Fuel Reduction Project Area on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest:

Typical spur road access will include entry culvert, gravel fill approximately 18 feet wide for culvert installation, road fabric material over culvert fill with rock on top of fabric & spot rocking of temp roads & landings.  The Forest Service has applied for temporary road construction permits from the Department of Transportation for this purpose.

Culvert removal & mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of four temporary road spurs with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake and/or ripper at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

Tree Removal in Unit 1 totaling approximately120 acres.  The work in each tree removal unit consists of mechanically felling all live trees marked with yellow paint & all dead & down trees, whole tree yarding of all felled & down trees to landings. All trees will be yarded to landings.  At landings approximately 600,000 bf will be de-limbed, bucked to length & decked seperately to Forest Service specification.  All remaining slash will be decked by contractor for later burning by the Forest Service.

Mechanical site preparation for natural regeneration of fuel reduction Unit 1 with a crawler tractor mounted brush rake or excavator mounted slashbuster at the conclusion of tree removal operations.

All costs for equipment maintenance and repair, fuel & filters, mobilization & demobilization to & from the project area must be included in the bid price amount for each Bid Item.  Bid quantities (number of acres) for each fuel reduction unit are approximate estimates at the time of receiving bid quotations.  After completion of fuel reduction operations in each unit, the government will complete a field traverse to establish actual treatment acreage.   Contract payments will be based on unit acreage determinations & the acreage unit price identified by the contractor.  The government reserves the right to add additional acreage to the total project operation pending the availability of funds.

Within seven days following contract award, the CONTRACTOR shall provide the government, a performance bond.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.


Requested Response:  

Parties interested in providing pricing information for past conservation technical services need to respond by accessing the TspCost Web page on the internet.  The web address is http://tspcost.sc.egov.usda.gov/  or link from http://sc.egov.usda.gov Information and instructions for populating the database are shown there.

Please submit questions about this notice by sending an email message to: edward.biggers@usda.gov.  Questions may also be sent by U.S. mail to: Edward M. Biggers, Jr., Director-Management Services Division, Room 5221-S, 1400 Independence Avenue., SW, Washington, DC 20250.

Responses must be received by April 30, 2003.

<DESC>This is a 100% small business set aside.  The NAICS Code is 561410 and the size standard for this type of business is $6 million in annual revenues.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will post the solicitation for this requirement on or about March 26, 2003 in Federal Business Opportunities.  NRC expects to award a contract with a one-year base period with four (4) one-year option periods to be exercised at the option of the Government.  

The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-553) requires the NRC to publish in the Federal Register proposed rules, final rules, statements of general policy and interpretations of general applicability.  In order to provide a timely compilation of the Federal Register notices issued by the NRC that have present or prospective regulatory effect, the Commission codifies and distributes its rulemaking documents in a publication entitled, "NRC Rules and Regulations." Supplements to this document are issued monthly and are distributed to NRC staff and to subscription holders.

The NRC regulatory documents published in the "NRC Rules and Regulations" and in its monthly supplements include final rules (which are codified into NRC regulations at 10 CFR Chapter 1), notices of proposed rulemaking, petitions for rulemaking, and statements of consideration (that portion of a Federal Register notice of a final rule which is published as "Supplementary Information"). The following types of documents and notices are also included: Policy Statements, Memoranda of Understanding, Listings of Regulatory Guides, a compendium of Systems of Records maintained by the NRC, and brief summaries of selected General Notices published in the Federal Register by the NRC and other Federal agencies which may have an impact upon NRC-regulated activities.

The objective of this contract is to prepare timely, complete, and accurate camera-ready copy for monthly supplements to the "NRC Rules and Regulations" and to provide an accurate and timely codification of final rules for inclusion in the basic "NRC Rules and Regulations."  In addition, all other types of Federal Register notices currently compiled in the "NRC Rules and Regulations" must be reviewed and deleted, or amended as necessary, on a monthly basis to coincide with the composition and issuance cycle for the monthly supplements.

The purpose of this modification it to make several changes to the language of the original pre-solicitation notice and to answer a few questions received to date.  The major changes to the notice would include: the combining of package areas A & B for the procurement, the allowance of firms to provide submissions to more than one package area, and changes to the evaluation criteria.  Prospective firms interested in participating in this procurement should review the revised version of the announcement carefully before providing their submission.  It will also be noted that submissions are now due by May 6, 2003.  Finally, interested firms are informed that the Contracting Officer for Region IX, Michael Koeppel, has been selected to serve on a jury for the next eight weeks.  During his absence, all questions regarding this procurement should be directed to Mr. Larry Larson, Contracting Officer Region VII, at (816) 283-7067 or by email at Larry.Larson@fema.gov  

Accordingly;

1.  The original synopsis, dated March 27, 2003, is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following in lieu thereof:


The Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region IX, intends to award multiple year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID-IQ) contracts for flood-related studies.  Each of the contracts will have a term of up to sixty (60) months.  A breakdown of package areas and the expected number of contract awards per package area is specified below. (Note that the number of contracts shown is an estimate, lesser quantities may be awarded.)

Region IX --
Package A-California, Arizona, Nevada – (4 contracts);
Package B-Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), & Pacific Trust Territories- (1 contract).

The selected firms may be required to provide the following services for coastal and riverine flooding:

(1)	Collect and enter map needs assessment parameters into national database – including routine data entry and update “maintenance” of the database;
(2)	Determine the flood hazard areas in the assigned communities, as appropriate during normal and post-disaster situations and generate data including field surveys and production of topographic map data using LIDAR, aerial, or other procedures as needed;
(3)	Conduct hydrologic and hydraulic modeling including the use of automated, geo-referenced procedures;

2. The following are answers to questions that have been received to date:


Q1:	[As stated in the synopsis] “If a firm will use multiple offices, for each of the criteria requiring ability and experience, show project experience for each specific office and list the personnel in that office who would be assigned to perform the work.”  This first question is what is the definition of “firm.”  Does this include all of [name of contractor] and our subconsultants?  [Name of contractor] has over 35 offices nationwide and our potential subconsultants have multiple offices.

A1:	In accordance with FAR 36.102, “firm” in conjunction with architect-engineer services, means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the professions of architect or engineering.

Q2:	The solicitation requests a limit on the number of resumes in Block 7 to 10 resumes.  If we have multiple offices, do we submit separate SF 255s for each office (submit a set of Block 7 resumes for each office limited to 10 resumes for each office?)

A2:	Only one (1) Standard Form 255 should be provided for each submission.  As such, a total of no more than 10 resumes can be provided.

Q3:	The solicitation requests that for each office show project experience and list the personnel in that office who would be assigned to perform the work.  Where does this listing of personnel fit into the SF 255?  Do we submit a separate Item 8 for each office to show the project experience for that office?

A3:	Block 8 of the SF 255 can be used to show project experience (see limitations for Block 8 as specified in the original synopsis).    A listing of personnel can be shown in the organizational chart.

Q4:	Item 10 of the SF 255 shall be limited to one single-sided page…”  Is the organizational chart the only item to be provided in Item 10.  Generally Item 10 can be used to provide supporting discussion particularly to address each of the 7 evaluation factors?

A4:	The organizational chart can be provided as a one page supplement to the standard form (as can the list of references requested by the original synopsis).    Block 10 of the SF 255 can be used in any means seen fit by the firm (see page and font size limitations as specified in the original synopsis).

Q5:	[Evaluation Factor 6] Location of the firm within the package area and the firm’s knowledge of the package area….  [Contractor’s name] has several offices in the package area we are considering.  The question is what about subconsultants…does this criteria hold for subconsultants or just the prime?

A5:	This criteria does not apply for subconsultants.  The original synopsis reads “the FIRM must have an office located within the geographical boundary of the package area.”

Q6:	[From the synopsis language] Firms interested in being considered to perform this work are required to submit (1) original and….for one, and only one, of the packages.  Submissions of multiple packages will result in all submittals for the firm to be discarded.”  Does this statement apply to a firm who wants to go as a prime on one package and also be subconsultants on another package?  Can a firm be a subconsultant on multiple packages?

A6:	In accordance with the revised synopsis language, firms may provide submissions for either or both package areas.  However, firms may only provide one submission per package area.  This limitation would apply to subconsultants/subcontractors as well as prime contractors.


Please note that the reference to “in house” made in the announcement refers to a prime (or joint venture) contractor but does not refer to subcontractors/subconsultants.

The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), established in conformance with the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and the H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, supports and promotes the goals of demand reduction for the substance abuse field.  Since 1987, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information has served at the Nation’s single point of entry in the Federal government for comprehensive, customer&#64979;friendly information about substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment.  NCADI operations have expanded significantly to meet the order fulfillment needs of the ONDCP National Youth Anti&#64979;Drug Media Campaign, SAMHSA’s targeted press efforts, CSAP’s dissemination and application initiatives as well as its highly targeted public health education campaigns, CSAT’s knowledge application initiative and public affairs efforts, as well as the dissemination efforts of NIAAA, NIDA, and the Department of Education.

SAMHSA’s National Mental Health Information Center (NMHIC) was established as the national focal point of contact about treatment and support services for mental health and mental illness. The Information Center provides appropriate, user-friendly information and referrals to; local, state and Federal agencies, professional organizations and clearinghouses, or national, state, and community mental health organizations and associations.. Under section 520(b)(10), of the Public Health Service Act, CMHS is mandated to establish a mental health information Clearinghouse. It also provides information dissemination support to CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program (during times of disaster), the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services and the School Violence Prevention Program. NMHIC also serves to disseminate information developed by CMHS programs about mental health services to adults with severe mental illnesses, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and family members. The Clearinghouse also assures the widespread dissemination of such information to States, political subdivisions, educational agencies and institutions, treatment and prevention service providers, and the general public.

The Clearinghouse is a contracted program which exists to serve a wide variety of Federal dissemination needs, but its ultimate success is based on its ability to reach the intended target audiences of SAMHSA and its Centers as well as the ONDCP and our other Federal partners.  These target audiences include, but are not limited to, general public, prevention and treatment practitioners, policymakers, community organizers, youth, educators, health care providers, faith-based organizations, social service providers, and the media.  As such, achieving high levels of customer satisfaction across all tasks are a primary focus for the NCADI contract.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number 9TE-03-SH-0075.  This procurement is to provide for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Geology Western Region Coastal and Marine Geology team (CMG).  Sediment labs are located in Menlo Park, California.  CMG scientists to conduct sediment analyses and derive information that includes particle-size data use the sediment labs.  CMG currently utilize a twenty-year old software program sedsize (SDSZ) that is used to determine the size distribution of sediment samples, and to derive the various statistical parameters used to characterize sediment. The program is no longer supported and it is cumbersome and extremely difficult for non-trained users to employ. Currently, SDSZ is especially archaic in that it uses a card-image text file for input and the language is FORTRAN.  Also, SDSZ is not interfaced to the various particle-size analyzers present in the sediment lab; thus particle-size data generated by each analyzer must be manually collected, merged, and then hand entered into SDSZ before the results are obtained. This costs valuable time and is a process open to data input errors. Another problem associated with SDSZ it that SDSZ has never been documented to the standards required by USGS for release to the public and thus CMG cannot share the software with colleagues or the public.  The objective of   this project is to rewrite and upgrade the software package developed and used by USGS CMG for sediment analysis.  The new software program must function in a personal computer (PC) enviroment, fully supported, flexible, and allow intergration/interfacing with an array of control computers to automate data input using a commercially available software package (MATLAB) to rewrite and upgrade the grain size software package called SDSZ and to make the program easier to use, process analysis quicker, and less susceptible to user input error. This will also allow CMG to interface to the various particle-size analyzers thereby automating data entry. This will also allow CMG to document SDSZ to the standards required by USGS for release, thus allowing CMG to share the package with colleagues, collaborators, and clients. CMG receives numerous requests for the current version of the software, and it cannot be shared because of incompatibility with the PC environment.   This requirement involves the utilization of specialized configurations which include custom designed geological analysis software and hardware.

<SOLNBR>DABJ29-03-T-0071
<RESPDATE>041503
<ARCHDATE>06142003
<CONTACT>Eva Lewis, 202-685-2171
<DESC>NA Sources Sought Notice  ///  Student Laptop Computers For National Defense University  ///  The National Defense University educates military and civilian leaders through teaching, research, and outreach in national security strategy, national military strategy, and national resource strategy; joint and multinational operations; information strat egies, operations, and resource management; acquisition; and regional defense and security studies.  //  The three major colleges execute curricula that are highly enriched in the use of electronic media.  Scheduling, preparation, classwork, coordination, research, evaluation, and many other functions are performed via the university network and web based app lications.  As such, the students require a reliable, portable computer with which to access this environment both at home and on campus to complete the prescribed curriculum effectively.  In the past the university has relied on the use of left over funds  to purchase computer for student use.  This has proved to be inadequate due to the sporadic and unreliable nature of these funds and the inability to purchase an entire fleet for each school that is supportable.  //  Given the above, the University is considering entering into a lease arrangement with a GSA schedule vendor to provide computers at the beginning of each school’s curriculum cycle with the intent of offering the student to option of purchasing the laptop c omputer at the end of the term of study.  Recent surveys of the 500+ students at the National War College (NWC) and Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) indicate that more than half of the students are attracted by this option.  Since the students  use the computer daily in their preparation, studies, research, and writing they look at it as the electronic repository for the critical information they personally found important during the course of their study.  The ability to carry this information away with them in a laptop computer that has at least two more years of useful life is very attractive.  ///  Operating Parameters  //  For the NWC, ICAF and Information Resource Management (IRMC) students the university would expect the selected vendor to be able to supply approximately 500+ laptop computers pre-configured with a “standard load” of functionality about mid-July for each in coming class.  For IRMC, the load will be three times per year (40 students per session, increasing to 72 students per session in 2004).  The university would supply the mirror image of the software load sufficient time in advance for the laptops to be con figured.   Each school’s Information Management Officer (IMO) would be responsible for coordinating with the faculty to determine to full range of functionality required by school.  A prototype load would be configured and tested by the IMO in conjunction with university CIO personnel in time to supply it to the vendor.  //  Once the loaded laptops are delivered to NDU each school will be responsible for issuing the computers to their respective students.  The University CIO organization will provide day-to-day maintenance of the software load and configuration changes necessa ry to support the curriculum execution.  The vendor will provide maintenance on the laptop to cover individual item failures through the usual warranty process.  In order to ensure that no student is left without a laptop the vendor is encouraged to mainta in adequate spares on site (~5%) for the CIO organization to issue while the warranty item is out for repair.  //  Each year the University CIO organization, in conjunction with the NWC, ICAF and IRMC IMOs, will review available laptop computer technology and, in conjunction with the vendor, select the one with best value for the upcoming class to replace those laptops  either sold to students from the previous year or meeting obsolescence. Ultimately no laptop computer should reach over three years of age while in use at NDU.  ///  Minimum  Laptop Computer Functionality  //  NWC, ICAF, and IRMC expect their students to require a laptop computer with capabilities nearing a “desktop equivalent.”  This means at least a 15” color monitor, a full size keyboard, state-of-the-art processor, at least 512MB RAM, internal modem, integra ted 10/100MB/s NIC, 30 GB hard drive capacity, combination DVD-CDRW, internal card slot for wireless, carrying case, scroll mouse, and adequate video RAM to support curriculum requirements to be able to load and view multi-media files on a regular basis. No more than two models will be existent at any time and full compatibility will be maintained on all laptop computers on removable devices to include power cords.  ///  Proposals  //  Please address expected time required to load and configure ~500 laptops computers per NDU specification.  Also, address appropriate payment scheme based on the cycle times listed above.  In particular, we are interested in whether a yearly, semi-annual, o r quarterly payment scheme is possible.  ///  Additional Information for Vendors (NOT part of the Lease Agreement with NDU)  //  At the end of the prescribed period of study (early June for NWC and ICAF) the students would like to make a decision whether or not to buy the laptop computer he/she had been using during their course of study. After the first year of operation if a stude nt desires to purchase a laptop one year older or one year newer than the one he/she was issued then the vendor is free to offer whatever is available to sell.  //  If the student chooses to buy the computer the vendor is free to negotiate the sale of the laptop to the individual.  The laptop must be wiped clean of all NDU-owned software and a fresh operating system installed.  The individual student is free to negoti ate with the vendor on any additional software they want installed. Once sold the vendor is expected to supply the University with a replacement laptop computer for the next term of study.  //  If the student chooses not to buy the computer the vendor is expected to reconfigure it to the specified new “standard load” provided by the faculty for the next academic year.  If a laptop computer goes unsold for more than two successive cycles the vendo r is expected to replace that laptop with a new version that meets University specifications.

<DESC>Source Synopsis for the Power Converter Assembly (PCA) within the Expanded Enhanced Fire Control Computer (EEFCC) for F-16, Block 25, 30 and 32.

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting Market Research of Industry to determine potential contractors who have the skills, experience and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort.  This is not a Request for Proposal or invitation for Bid. The F-16 Support Division, Avionics section, has a requirement for manufacture and delivery of the power supply (NSN: 5998-01-253-2280), PN: 7565637-011,021,041,051.  The PCA is for the Expanded Enhanced Fire Control Computer (EEFCC) within the F-16 Block 25, 30 and 32 Weapon System.
The Air Force would like to replace this shop replaceable unit (SRU) PCA with a new design, under the Falcon Flex Program (Form, Fit and Function Interface Requirement).  We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability PCA using modern technology rather than traditional build-to-print requirements.    Interested parties would be required to provide estimated cost for the design of a new Power Converter Assembly and manufacture as many as 725 units to replace the existing PCA which is the cause of unacceptable support problems in the F-16 Weapon Systems.  The plan is to replace these power supplies based on attrition at about 145 units per year.

<SUBJECT>19--Sources Sought for 25M Fast Patrol Craft for Egypt
<SOLNBR>N0002403xxxx
<CONTACT>Point of Contact: Stephen V. Piasecki, SEA 02222, piaseckisv@navsea.navy.mil.  Contracting Officer
<DESC>This sources-sought synopsis is issued in anticipation of a potential future procurement program.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine the existence and interest of sources for design and construction of four (4) to six (6) fast patrol craft approximately 25 meters in length.  The craft would be procured for implementation of newly established requirements for the Egyptian Border Guard under a Foreign Military Sales case and would operate within Egyptian territorial waters to conduct the specific missions of assisting mariners in distress, executing search and rescue operations, performing hostile and non-hostile law enforcement services, and conducting local patrolling operations for surveillance and data gathering.  At the current point in the program, steel, aluminum and GRP construction are being considered.  However, this may change as a result of ongoing specification development and responses received to this announcement.  The craft shall have a proven hull form with minimal variance from parent craft currently in-service, maximum 1.5 meter navigational draft, and be capable of maximum sustained speed of 40-knots or better in sea-state 2 (sustained wind velocity of 13.5 knots and significant wave height of 2.9 feet).  The craft shall have a minimum 500 nautical mile range at sustained cruise speed of 20 knots at full load in sea-state 3 (sustained wind velocity of 16 knots and significant wave height of 4.6 feet).  The craft shall have accommodations for twelve (12) with a five (5) day endurance.  The craft shall accommodate a stern ramp for the launch and retrieval in up to sea-state 2 of at least a 4.5-meter rubber inflatable boat with outboard motor, and provide foundations for two 20 mm naval guns (1 fwd  and 1 aft) and two 0.5 caliber guns (1 port and 1 stbd).  The craft should be supportable in Egypt and have an expected 20 year service life.  Anticipate operational and maintenance training to be required for up to seven (7) personnel for each craft.  The craft design and construction shall be certified in accordance with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building & Classing High Speed Naval Craft.  Companies that bid previously on Egyptian RFQ #19-21-2000 dated 10 April 2000 are encouraged to respond to this notice.  Prospective firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary that does not exceed five (5) pages in length describing their patrol craft and firm's recent relevant business experience and their approach in meeting the requirements stated above.  Responses should include: (a) The name and address of the contractor and where the boat would be buil t;  (b) Point of contact including name, title, phone, and email addresses; (c) A description of craft currently offered by the contractor that meet, or with minor modifications might meet, the above listed requirements to include contract and customer information regarding the "parent" craft; (d) A notional schedule for detail design, construction and on-site delivery of the craft, (e) An estimated unit price, and (f) Whether the business is currently classified as a Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a) and/or Woman Owned company, Hub Zone small business, veteran owned small business, or service disabled veteran owned small business.  Where to submit: Email responses or inquiries should be sent to Mr. Steve Piasecki at piaseckisv@navsea.navy.mil.  To help ensure proper receipt, name the email "EG FPC Response" or "EG FPC Inquiry" in the subject field.

<SUBJECT>A--DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURE OF VERY HIGH STRENGTH, LIGHTWEIGHT UNDERWATER TOW CABLES FABRICATED FROM NONTRADITIONAL SYNTHETIC MATERIALS.
<SOLNBR>N6133103QJT01
<RESPDATE>042103
<CONTACT>Joan Troutman at 850-230-7230, or Contracting Officer Carol Dreger at 850-234-4863.
<DESC>GOVERNMENT SOURCES SOUGHT / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  NSSWCDD / CSS is seeking sources for design, development, and manufacture of very high strength light weight underwater tow cables fabricated with non-traditional synthetic materials. The tow cables will contain elements such as optical fibers, electrical power conductors, hard fairings, ribbon fairings, tow staff (wet end mechanical termination), wet end and dry end electro-optical connectors used for instrumentation, data transfer, and control of various mine countermeasures towed devices.  The tow cable would be used to deploy (stream), tow, and recover towed bodies and other sensor arrays using a winch/davit subsystem (primarily from helicopters although shipboard systems may be of interest as well).  Optical fibers are used for data transmission, and electrical conductors are used to supply power to the towed body from the helicopter. The tow cable for these types of systems is a significant driver with respect to how the tow body/array reacts.  Therefore, the tow cable being procured must be comparable to the design of the towed systems in terms of weight, size (diameter and length), drag and strength parameters. With respect to airborne towed systems the weight of the tow cable is a significant factor in determining the on-station capability of the air vehicle and therefore the area coverage of the system for a single mission.  The Navy’s use of smaller multi-role aircraft, such as the MH-60S series for Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM), is driving a need for the lightest, strongest systems possible for maximum sweep time. Previous U.S. Navy studies have shown that potentially a tow cable constructed from non-traditional synthetic materials wo uld be significantly lighter than the current stainless steel armored cables. An added benefit to cables that are not armored with metal would be their corrosion resistance. Descriptive information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets and company points of contact.  Firms should be ISO 9001 certified in the manufacture of cables used in the types of applications of interest specified herein. Also of interest are proven technologies that are planned to become available in the 2004/2007 timeframe.  Firms should indicate any interest or willingness to provide technology when responding. Design proposals requiring developmental funding are not of interest at this time; this RFI may not directly lead to a request for proposals.  Deadline for submission is 21 April 2003. Additional information about U.S. Navy towed OAMCM and other mine countermeasures systems p ertinent to this RFI can be obtained by accessing:  www.ncsc.navy.mil

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, Georgia, to use "research value mapping" methods (Bozeman and Kingsley, 1999) to review the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Cooperative Program for Infertility Research (NCPIR), a research centers program managed by the Reproductive Sciences Branch of the NICHD Center for Population Research.  The overall purpose of the review is to determine if the NCPIR is achieving its three principal goals of research, training, and community outreach.  The overall review objectives are to:  (1) examine the three NCPIR centers as a "national resource" for the infertility research community; (2) determine the program's capacity to form linkages with other center/network programs and how the program influences other researchers in the reproductive sciences; (3) assess the capability of the centers to train clinician-scientists and contribute to their career trajectories in infertility research; and (4) study the organization and structure of the NCPIR centers compared with similar NIH and non-NIH research programs, and how the NCPIR structure can be changed to influence program outcomes.  To accomplish these objectives, however, the NICHD will use three specific data collection and analysis strategies, pioneered as the "research value mapping" methods for scientific program analysis.  These include: (1) case studies of the NCPIR research centers, including a comparative analysis of other research center case studies performed by Georgia Tech; (2) a survey of the principal users of research products (publications and new technologies) created by the NCPIR research centers, employing the concept of the "knowledge value alliance" (Bozeman, Dietz, and Gaughan, 1999), as a sampling strategy and analytic framework; (3) a research training analysis performed by coding and analyzing the curriculum vitae of researchers and research fellows affiliated with the NCPIR centers (Dietz, Chompalov, Bozeman, O'Neil Lane, and Park, 2000).  The corporate capability of offerors to perform the NCPIR review will be evaluated on four criteria:  (1) knowledge of "research value mapping" methods developed at the School of Public Policy, Georgia Tech, including an understanding of the concepts of "knowledge value alliance" and "scientific and technical human capital"; (2) experience in applying case study methods to research center programs and comparing organization and structural properties with that obtained from prior case studies of science programs performed by Georgia Tech; (3) experience in designing and conducting "user surveys" of scientific programs; and (4) experience in coding curriculum vita and analyzing data to measure the career trajectories of researchers and research fellows, employing "event history analysis" as the principal statistical tool.

Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 1) Is your business a large or small business? 2) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 3) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  4) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 5) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 6) Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to maintain the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Addiction (NCADI) program which will be combined with the Center for Mental Health’s Clearinghouse.  The incumbent for each is currently ORC/Macro.

The National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI), established in conformance with the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, the Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the ADAMHA Reorganization Act of 1992, and the H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, supports and promotes the goals of demand reduction for the substance abuse field.  Since 1987, the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information has served at the Nation’s single point of entry in the Federal government for comprehensive, customer-friendly information about substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment.  NCADI operations have expanded significantly to meet the order fulfillment needs of the ONDCP National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, SAMHSA’s targeted press efforts, CSAP’s dissemination and application initiatives as well as its highly targeted public health education campaigns, CSAT’s knowledge application initiative and public affairs efforts, as well as the dissemination efforts of NIAAA, NIDA, and the Department of Education.

SAMHSA’s National Mental Health Information Center (NMHIC) was established as the national focal point of contact about treatment and support services for mental health and mental illness. The Information Center provides appropriate, user-friendly information and referrals to; local, state and Federal agencies, professional organizations and clearinghouses, or national, state, and community mental health organizations and associations.. Under section 520(b)(10), of the Public Health Service Act, CMHS is mandated to establish a mental health information Clearinghouse. It also provides information dissemination support to CMHS programs including: the Emergency Services and Disaster Relief Program (during times of disaster), the National Public Information/Education Campaign on Children's Mental Health Services and the School Violence Prevention Program. NMHIC also serves to disseminate information developed by CMHS programs about mental health services to adults with severe mental illnesses, children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbances and family members. The Clearinghouse also assures the widespread dissemination of such information to States, political subdivisions, educational agencies and institutions, treatment and prevention service providers, and the general public.

The Clearinghouse is a contracted program that exists to serve a wide variety of Federal dissemination needs, but its ultimate success is based on its ability to reach the intended target audiences of SAMHSA and its Centers as well as the ONDCP and our other Federal partners.  These target audiences include, but are not limited to, general public, prevention and treatment practitioners, policymakers, community organizers, youth, educators, health care providers, faith-based organizations, social service providers, and the media.  As such, achieving high levels of customer satisfaction across all tasks are a primary focus for the NCADI contract.

<DESC>1.  ANNOUNCEMENT:  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now included within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Emergency Preparedness & Response (EPR) Directorate, hereinafter referred to as FEMA, requires services under the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 to develop, plan, manage, implement, and monitor an initiative known as Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization for flood hazard mitigation across the United States and its territories.  All firms interested in applying for work are required to submit documentation specified in this synopsis under paragraph 5, SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  SFs 254 and 255, and attachment, submitted in response to this synopsis will be used for screening firms preliminary to inviting submission of additional information.  The North American Industrial Classification System Code is 541330.  The small business size standard is $4 million (not-to-exceed).  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  If a large business is selected for contract award, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not required with initial submittal, but will be required prior to contract award if a large business is selected for contract negotiations.  The government intends to negotiate a Performance-Based contract, based upon the draft Statement of Objectives (attached to this synopsis).  Award of one contract is anticipated by July 2003 for a period of one (1) base year, plus four (4) 1-year options.  2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  Services incidental to the A-E effort are considered critical.  The government requires a strong, dedicated, management team with knowledge and experience to meet or exceed performance-based expectations.  Although engineering and IT skills are essential enablers to the success of the project, Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization relies on partnering and technology in map production and product delivery.  While FEMA’s particular focus is Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based hydrology and hydraulic modeling, and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) remote sensing for its National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) mandate, FEMA is developing maps that address all hazards.  FEMA’s strategy for implementing Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization emphasizes utilization of existing geographic data resources and intergovernmental coordination on new data development.  Program management approaches must consider the current regulatory framework and statutory authorities FEMA operates within, but also identify potential changes that would provide for more efficient long-term program management.  Acquiring national elevation data through innovative and cost effective technology is anticipated to provide the essential element for establishing an interoperable geo-spatial infrastucture for maps and geo-spatial data for all hazards, including those that are man made.  Four major OBJECTIVES of Multi-Hazard Flood Map Modernization are: (1) Establish and Maintain Premier Data Collection and Delivery System:  Create a geospatial system within 90 days of contract award that provides easy access to reliable flood risk data and other information and hazard data supporting risk management application and operations.  (2) Achieve Effective Program Management:  Develop and provide a continually improving program management structure that motivates partners to share responsibilities and aligns partner missions to reduce the nations vulnerability to flood and other hazards.  The program objective is to produce digitized, final maps approved by local governments within 36 months from receipt of study requirements.  (3) Build and Maintain Mutually Beneficial Partnerships:  Foster mutually beneficial partnerships and improve the systems that support them to achieve a shared outcome through the communication of flood risk and other hazard information.  Partnerships will result in enhanced delivery of risk management applications and operations.  (4) Expand and Better Inform the User Community:  Foster public and stake holder understanding of where to obtain flood and other hazard information and how to use and analyze it in order to make sound decisions to reduce their vulnerability to natural, accidental or man made hazards.  Subject to the availability of funds, the minimum cost of the services is $50 million.  The maximum estimated cost for services is $750 million over the life of the contract.    FEMA will serve as the Federal lead with responsibility to maintain and disseminate a seamless nationwide flood theme in partnership with State, local, and regional government agencies.  It is expected that FEMA will no longer be responsible for developing and distributing framework data needed to produce flood maps.  Rather, FEMA will become a collaborative partner with State, local, and other federal agencies.  The intended scope of the resulting contract will be to manage, implement, and monitor the initiation and completion of mapping projects and further build the capabilities of FEMA's State and local partners consistent with the NFIP and DHS's strategic goals.   A more complete description of the objectives is attached to this synopsis.  3.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The procurement process will consist of two phases: (1) a screening phase during which SFs 254 and 255, and attachment, will be used to select at least three (3) of the most highly qualified firms for continued participation in the procurement process;  and (2) a selection phase during which slated firms (selected during the screening phase) will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations regarding their concept for furnishing the required services.  Additional information will consist of a comprehensive program management plan, a technical work plan, and a quality assurance and surveillance plan.  The oral presentation is to be conducted by the proposed management team.  Discussions will follow pursuant to FAR36.602(3).  During the first phase (or screening phase) approaches for accomplishing factors 1(d), 1(e), and 2 (e) are to be visionary in nature, identifying the "general" direction or concept of proposed solutions, whereas, approaches for factors 1(d), 1(e), and 2(e) that are submitted by the slated firms are to be "comprehensive" in nature.  Factors 1, 2, and 3 are of equal weight and importance.  Factors 4 and 5 are of equal weight but of less importance than factors 1, 2, and 3.  Factor 6 is of least importance.  The government will evaluate submissions based on the following factors:  FACTOR 1.  PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES:  (a) Ability to successfully accomplish the major objectives of the multi-hazard flood map modernization as defined in the statement of objectives (attached to this synopsis).

(e) Capability and approach to developing a quality assurance and surveillance plan that reflects the performance standards and incentives tied to the Statement of Objectives. (The approach should address  your concept for development of performance standards, acceptable levels of performance, surveillance methodology and incentives/disincentives.) FACTOR 2.  SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: (a)  Experience in providing program management and project management achieving reliable performance management (including Earned Value Management Systems) that ensured data quality and delivery within time and pricing constraints; that supported the clients strategic goals; and that successfully measured, evaluated and incorporated improvements into the process.  (b) Experience in the design and implementation of complex, multiple location enterprise-wide IT infrastructure for geo-spatial systems that provide a high level of interoperability with a variety of other systems and platforms.  (c)   Experience in the areas of water resources engineering; surveying and mapping; flood hazard data collection and analyses; flood mitigation techniques; building sciences, and software engineering and website development.

Those rifles meeting the criteria for ceremonial and drill rifles will be converted according to a scope of work (SOW).  The weapons that meet criteria for other categories will be held for appropriate dispositio n.  The Government anticipates award of a 5-year repair type contract for an estimated quantity of 10,000 to 15,000 ceremonial rifles.  The prospective contractor will be required to store up to 15,000 weapons.  The US Army will provide M1 Garands for conv ersion to ceremonial and drill rifle configuration.  The conversion process will include disassembly/reassembly, precision measurements, welding, visual inspection, and some touch up.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  

The Committee is considering the addition of: Pen, Gel, Executive (7520-00-NIB-1491); and Quick Drop Mop Handles (7920-00-NIB-0401, 7920-00-NIB-0402, and 7920-00-NIB-0403).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Optically Triggered Fire Set Detonator System
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE â€œOPTICALLY TRIGGERED FIRE SET/DETONATOR SYSTEMâ€


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to develop and commercialize LLNL's "Optically Triggered Fire Set/Detonator System".

The invention enables the initiation of high explosives at a single point in space at a precisely planned time. The use of an array of units allows many points in space to be initiated at a precisely planned time with very low jitter of the array in time. This can be applied to creating surface lighting waves with very high faithfulness to the planned surface geometry. 

The initiation of large arrays of shaped charges simultaneously, with very little jitter, may be of interest to the oil servicing industry as well as for perforation, perforating guns, and shaped charges. Shaped charges are used to perforate the sides of  wells and surrounding geologic formation with as many holes as possible. Adjacent charges can destroy one anotherâ€™s jet if they are too close in distance or too far apart in time when initiated. This invention allows charges to be close-packed in their array, vastly improving the yield.

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention.  In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industrial partners to commercialize the invention.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's optically triggered fire set/detonator system should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology as described. Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO00016-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's subject title.

INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-12.***
*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 221310 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote.***
***NIST will be replacing a tube and shell type heat exchanger with a plate type heat exchanger. In order to prevent the heat exchanger from clogging, a duplex filter system will be installed on the inlet side of the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger will be located in a room that is not accessible during the operation cycle of the plant. A duplex bag filter system will be required to collect and filter dirt and debris from the plant chilled water supply line. Debris and dirt collected in the bags will be disposed of as a waste and clean water will be directed to the inlet side of the heat exchanger. The flow of water will be directed to one of the filter vessels by a set of actuated valves, while the other filter vessel is standing by. If, during the operation cycle, the pressure drop on the active filter vessel exceeds a preset pressure differential between inlet and outlet of the filter, the system will automatically switch to the alternate filter.
