<DESC>This procurement is for a small business set-aside. NASA/MSFC has a requirement for fabrication work on Kulite Semiconductor pressure transducers, part number LL-3-125-150A. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Kulite Semiconducotr Products, Inc. on a sole source basis.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Vanessa Lindsey via e-mail, Vanessa.D.Lindsey@nasa.gov, no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 4, 2003.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sea Technology Services for the development of multi-instrumented buoys and instrumentation for multi-scattering target strength estimation for the Advanced Survey Technologies Program of the Southwest Fisheries Science Center.  This development is a critical component of the U.S. AMLR program and is an annual cruise to a study area located in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Both shipboard and shore-based studies are conducted in order to monitor the state of the pelagic ecosystem.  One of the components of shipboard operations is the collection and archiving of data used to describe the physical environment.  These data include 1) continuous observations of sea surface and meteorological conditions, and 2) vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, light transmission, and other parameters, and 3) the deployment, monitoring, and recovery of multi-instrumented buoy arrays.
The contractor has multiple years of prior involvement in the specific oceanographic data collection tasks, and in the design, manufacturing, and deployment of multi-instrumented buoy equipment to be used in these studies.  For both studies, the contractor will assist in the setup, integration, testing, troubleshooting and deployment of the oceanographic, meteorological, and echosounder equipment.  The contractor will also assemble, test, deploy in the Southern Ocean, and re-pack the multi-instrumented buoy instrumentation.  Moreover, the contractor will provide Electrical, Mechanical, and Software Engineering services as well as machining and instrument construction.  Ultimately, results from all of these research efforts will help to ensure the long-term sustainability of the krill fishery, the health of land-breading predators (primarily seals and penguins) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and assist in the remote sensing of a variety of commercially harvested and ecologically important marine species.
Specific objectives for this contract are:
1.	Set up and maintain the instruments, connections and data logging equipment;
2.	Collect and archive underway and station data;
3.	Prepare a report summarizing activities and data collected;
4.	Provide general electronic technician support to other shipboard research components;

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement to complete the development of its Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP) across all of its enterprise missions and programs.  Over the past year an initial segment of the EA was developed focusing on Command and Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability within Coast Guard and its partner agencies.  An initial version of the ETP centered on C4ISR was also produced.  Services during 2004 will continue the original plan by extending the EA and ETP to include the non-C4ISR systems (finance, personnel, logistics, etc.).  The completion of the ETP will function as a roadmap for all USCG for current and planned Information Technology (IT) procurements.  The objectives of the proposed effort are to:  extend the EA to include business (non-C4ISR) systems, provide more in-depth C4ISR architectural analysis to meet emerging requirements for Maritime Domain Awareness, and implement management and governance procedures initiated during 2003.  The products developed under this task order must be coordinated with the further development of the Department of Homeland Security EA while ensuring alignment with DOD Architecture Framework.  MITRE Corp. developed the initial segment of EA and the initial version of the ETP.  The USCG intends to issue a sole source contract to MITRE for this research and development as a follow-on effort.  This is not a request for proposals.  No solicitation is available, nor will one be issued.  Parties that believe they can fulfill this requirement are required to submit qualification packages prior to the closing date.  Packages must contain a full description of the party’s capability to fulfill the Coast Guard requirements in sufficient detail to determine whether the firm is acceptable.  Marketing information and high level corporate capability statements are not desired and will not be accepted.  In the event no additional capable firms are identified through this synopsis, the Coast Guard will award a sole source contract.  See numbered note 22.  Closing date for submission is 12/15/03.

PART I 
RESEARCH INTERESTS 
A. INTRODUCTION 
This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. AFRL/MN contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MN should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/MN scientist identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MN may have in a specific research project. Proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open. However, prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are required to submit a two to three page white paper on their proposed research topic, identifying the key AFRL/MN staff members who have been identified and contacted for each area of interest.  Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction). Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants. Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources. Our goal is to award ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and thirty percent (30%) to small businesses, which includes ten percent (10%) to Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), over the life of the BAA. For the purpose of this BAA the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710).  In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received which are acceptable regardless of source. This BAA will remain open until superceded.  It will be reissued periodically and may be amended at any time.

The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  To contact an AFRL/MN staff member by mail, include branch or division symbol and write: Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate 101 W. Eglin Blvd. Eglin AFB FL 32542 
B. MISSION 
The Munitions Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions. The Munitions Directorate plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munition System Program Offices.
There are three divisions within the Munitions Directorate which conduct research and development. They are the Assessment and Integration Division, the Ordnance Division, and the Advanced Guidance Division.
ASSESSMENT AND INTEGRATION DIVISION (MNA) 
The Assessment and Integration Division is responsible for assessment of lethality, effectiveness, and utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. The Division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, submunition dispensing, and weapon carriage and release concepts. The division also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. MNA maintains in-house facilities and capabilities in the areas of aeroballistics, weaponry aerodynamic performance analysis, and mechanical integration. The Division consists of the Computational Mechanics Branch (MNAC), the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (MNAL), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (MNAV).
ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (MNG) 
The Advanced Guidance Division conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in electrooptical, millimeter-wave, and radio-frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons and submunition guidance. The Division performs laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts. The Division also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop seeker evaluation facility, an image processing laboratory, a radio-frequency signal processing laboratory, a laser radar facility, and an electrooptics laboratory. The Division consists of the Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch (MNGI), the Guidance Simulation Branch (MNGG), the Navigation and Control Branch (MNGN), and the Seeker Branch (MNGS). 
ORDNANCE DIVISION (MNM) 
The Ordnance Division directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development of fuzes, warheads, and explosives. Air launched munitions ordnance should consider fighter, bomber, and UAV aircraft as the launch platforms.   Air launched munitions ordnance should be as small as possible but effective against fixed targets, mobile targets and air targets while limiting collateral damage.  MNM operates high-explosives R&D facilities that support munitions programs. MNM also provides technical evaluation and consulting services to other government agencies and industries concerned with munitions technology. MNM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (MNME), the Fuzes Branch (MNMF), the Ordnance Integration Branch (MNMI), and the Damage Mechanisms Branch (MNMW). 
C. RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS
To support the missions of AFRL/MN, research is required in the areas described in this section. These descriptions are not meant to exclude other research topics which are consistent with the mission of the Munitions Directorate and its Divisions. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. 
FLIGHT VEHICLES INTEGRATION RESEARCH
The goal of this work is to perform flight vehicles integration research in the areas of: weapon airframe design, alternate flight control, submunition design dispensing technology, precision emplacement, and compressed carriage missile design.  Applications include high angle-of-attack missile and air-to-surface weapon airframes, rapid response weapon concepts for use on time-critical targets, hypersonic platform and space operating vehicle weapon integration/dispensing, and uninhabited combat air vehicle (UCAV) weapon integration/dispensing.  Research interests include modeling and design of advanced carriage and release equipment for application to both internal and external carriage, especially as applied to small size and weight munitions on high speed advanced aircraft.  Other areas of interest include:  active and passive control of air vehicles through the use of innovative technologies such as adaptive smart structures, microelectromechanical (MEMS) systems (i.e. micro blowing, synthetic jets), application of weakly ionized gasdynamics (i.e., plasma aerodynamics), micro-parafoil technologies for precision emplacement, and innovative methods for munition strike performance (e.g., BDA).

BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL 
Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Therefore the Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch has interest in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munition seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division as well as the munition product systems described in the current Conventional Armament Technology Area Plan found on our home page.

AUTONOMOUS TARGET RECOGNITION 
The Seeker Image and Signal Processing Branch (MNGI) is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.

HARDWARE-IN-THE-LOOP REAL-TIME TESTING TECHNOLOGIES 
The Guidance Simulation Branch (MNGG) is interested in investigating technologies related to hardware-in-the-loop testing of advanced missile designs. MNGG exercises complete missile hardware-in-the-loop simulations to verify the signal processing, image processing, and guidance performance including terminal homing accuracy. Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) as well as Tactical Munition subsystems developed within WL/MN are tested. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Research emphasis will be placed on advancement of scene projection technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, and high bandwidth motion simulators as they apply to the test of advanced weapon guidance systems.

LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH
The Advanced Guidance Division has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems.  These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems.  Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components.  These include the following:
Optical Sources:  Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (< 5 microns) are desired.  These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs).  The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials.  Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest.
Detector systems:  Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired.  Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors).
Beam pointing and beam scanning systems:  Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired.  Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired.  Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices.  Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest.

Detection schemes:  Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest.  Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation.  Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation.
Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems:  Systems which can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required.  These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty.  A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.

NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY 
The Navigation and Control Branch (MNGN) is interested in developing inertial sensor components, GPS anti-jam and antenna technology, and advanced guidance and control techniques. Inertial sensor technology should be focused on developing technologies with the goal of achieving at least tactical grade performance with the potential for significantly reduced costs and size (less than $2K and 15 cubic inches per inertial measurement unit respectively). Inertial sensor technologies of interest include micromachined and optical. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Advanced guidance and control technologies of interest include: guidance law and autopilot designs that minimize redesign with each new weapon application, methodologies capable of identifying and tracking dynamic changes in the attitude of air-to-air targets, and integrated weapon guidance. Integrated weapon guidance includes guidance-autopilot integration, guidance-seeker-fuze-warhead integration, guidance-seeker integration, and total system integration to include hardware sensor integration.

<DESC>The Navy intends to procure system integrator services necessary to converge the four Navy Enterprise Resource Planning pilot projects (NEMAIS, SIGMA, SMART and CABRILLO) into one Navy enterprise design.  The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be January 2004 through July 2004, with an additional one two-month option.  Efforts will include interoperability activities and lab services for integrating the pilot designs into a Navy standard template.  Functional processes include: financial management, program management, I-level maintenance, plant-level supply, wholesale supply, and human resource management.  The Navy intends to negotiate and award a modification to a current delivery order under Blanket Purchase Agreement N00421-00-A-0351 with BearingPoint LLC as the prime contractor and IBM Global Services-Federal and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) as major subcontractors for the ERP System Interoperability effort.  BearingPoint, IBM, and EDS as the current Navy Enterprise Resource Planning Pilot System Integrators are uniquely qualified to provide the required effort.  The incumbent system integrators have closely worked over the last 42 months with the Navy in bringing the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) SAP solution to the Navy customer base.  In that time they have gained expert knowledge in the Navy business processes and how those legacy business processes align to the SAP COTS industry best practices.  The current pilot integrators are the only companies with the background knowledge of the four Navy ERP pilots and the interoperability issues between them.  Only the BearingPoint/IBM/EDS team has the knowledge and experience to accomplish the ERP interoperability tasking in the timeframe required.  Note 22

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. It is the Governments intention to award a Multiple Award Construction Contract-MACC.  This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity Design-Build and-or Bid-Build Contracts. The Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures will be utilized for this procurement. The work will primarily consist of general cathodic protection installation projects, new construction and repair of existing cathodic protection systems, including but not limited to impressed current cathodic protection systems and galvanic cathodic protection systems for activities worldwide. Work may also include corrosion control through the application of coatings, however this is only a minor portion of the anticipated work. This solicitation intends to award of up to four Indefinite Quantity Design-Build and-or Bid-Build Contracts with potential for firm fixed price task orders. The base period shall consist of 365 calendar days with up to four one-year option periods.  The option years may be exercised by the Government during which separate Task Orders for projects may be issued. The estimated value for all four contracts is $15 million with a total maximum not-to-exceed amount of $25 million.  Each contract will consist of a one base year with up to four option years.  The anticipated range for each task order is between $50,000 and $500,000 with most task orders falling in the range of $150,000 to $300,000.  The Government reserves the right to award up to four contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation. The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0448. There is no set maximum amount under each of the up to four contracts that may be awarded as a result of this solicitation other than that the total amount for all task orders issued during the five year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed the total amount of $25 million. After award of the initial contracts, only the successful offerors will compete for future task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  The Government intends for all MACC contractors to actively participate and submit proposals on each task order.  Failure to participate may result in the Government exercising its right NOT to award an option period.  Participation in the pre-proposal conference and site visits for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offerors and are not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services. Projects will also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of projects to be awarded during the term of this contract. Professional registration or certification is required in the state where the projects are located as needed to obtain construction environmental permits and to comply with agency regulations. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to 3 to 7 offerors Design-Build and-or Bid-Build teams based on Design-Build and-or Bid-Build factors that Qualifications, including proposed subcontractors, Management include: Past Performance, Technical Approach, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Phase I Design-Build and-or Bid-Build factors relate to the FIVE year IDIQ contract requirements for general cathodic protection type projects including, new construction and renovations, but not limited to particular facilities such as petroleum, oil and lubricant-POL-facilities; waterfront structures; utility systems-water, natural gas, steam, etc.; or other areas where cathodic protection and corrosion control is applied.  Work may also include minor construction or repair of government facilities and utilities such as POL piping systems, fuel storage tanks and utility systems. Work may also include performing cathodic protection surveys-structure to electrolyte potential surveys-close interval surveys, etcor American Petroleum Institute-API-inspections-API 570, API 610, etc.; or general preventative maintenance work-painting, grading, etc.-on projects other than the seed project identified in Part 4 of Section 00150 of the RFP for activities located world-wide.  Although the work will not be primarily in one location, locations of task orders in the first contract year will likely be: Fleet Industrial Support Center-FISC, Pearl Harbor, HA; NAS Oceana, VA; Air Reserve Station Willow Grove, PA; and Various Locations in Japan and South Korea.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I may participate in the Phase II process.  Also, the Government may not release the names of the Phase II firms selected to compete. In Phase II, the Government will require the competitive field to submit a technical and price proposal for a SEED project. The Phase II technical proposal will evaluate the management approach and project plan; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; will require preparation of a limited design solution, and other factors that define the quality of construction and cost.  Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope-design options within the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed project-s.  It is anticipated the offeror-s awarded the seed project-s will meet the minimum guarantee amount.  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract-s.  The minimum guarantee may be payable only if the offeror-s are awarded no task orders over the term of their contract.  Per the Debt Collections Improvement Act of 1996, The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement-DFAR requires all contractors to register in the Department of Defense-DOD Central Contract Registration-CCR- Database. Be advised, failure to register in the CCR makes an offeror ineligible for award of DOD contracts.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service has two objectives for submitting this notice. The first objective is to obtain public and private comments on the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for an A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for Files Activities. 
The Government is currently performing this work.  Currently, individual and business tax returns are processed in the IRS Submission Processing Centers (SPC) and delivered to the Files Activity for storage.  The Files Activity is composed of 10 different geographic locations that are used to organize and store millions of individual and business paper tax returns and related documents processed each year.  Each location houses the returns from eight weeks to a year, depending on the space available for storage.  At the end of the storage period, the documents are retired to a Federal Records Center (FRC) managed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  Customers consist of individual taxpayers to federal officials who can request copies or originals of those documents in the custody of the Files Activity or documents retired to FRC.  Obtaining and delivering those tax documents and related information is the majority of the workload accomplished.  
The Government will consider all information received when preparing a final PWS; however, any and all changes are at the sole discretion of the Government. In addition to comments to the draft PWS, please address the following: (1) Proposal preparation period.  Provide the length of time you believe you will need to prepare a proposal to adequately address all requirements; (2) Provide appropriate performance incentives.

Should the Government have questions regarding individual responses, the responder will be contacted for further information. Please include the name of a point of contact, e-mail address and telephone number of this person. This is a DRAFT PWS and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a FORMAL RFP, RFQ or contract. Response to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The DRAFT PWS is available at the following IRS internet site: http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov (under Business Opportunities). All comments regarding the PWS and associated documents should be e-mailed to awss.fileact@irs.gov. Only electronic comments will be accepted.

This solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541710.   DAIT plans, sponsors and directs national and international extramural research programs in basic immunology, asthma and allergic and immunologic diseases.  Through these programs, DAIT-supported investigators conduct basic, pre-clinical and clinical investigations into the causes, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of a broad range of immune-mediated disorders.  DAIT intends to solicit proposals from organizations capable of performing clinical site monitoring services in support of DAIT’s Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  Under this contract, the contractor will establish a Clinical Site Monitoring Group (CSMG) to assess the quality and enhance performance of sites participating in the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  In FY 1999, the NIAID established the Immune Tolerance Network (see http://www.immunetolerance.org) an international consortium of over 70 basic scientists and clinical investigators, to test promising tolerogenic treatment regimens in four clinical areas: islet transplantation; kidney transplantation; autoimmune diseases; and asthma and allergic diseases.  In FY 2000, the ITN began accepting proposals for clinical trials of tolerance induction and has completed 14 full review cycles by July 2002.  A total of 155 concept proposals have been submitted and 46 were accepted for submission as full proposals; non-ITN members submitted approximately 75% of these.  To date, 21 clinical trials have been approved for implementation in all four clinical areas.  This contract will be managed by the DAIT Office of Clinical Applications, who is responsible for site monitoring and regulatory activities associated with clinical trials in organ and islet transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and asthma and allergic diseases.  Work to be performed will include:  monitoring of clinical research studies conducted by the ITN; initiating and monitoring of sites and pharmacies conducting DAIT-supported ITN studies in the United States and abroad; and monitoring of laboratory facilities and procedures for obtaining testing and storing clinical research specimens, when requested as a special assignment; training site personnel on good clinical practice and on the policies and procedures established by DAIT, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the ITN; recruiting and training site monitors; providing reports on monitoring findings and training activities; collaborating with DAIT and the ITN; and facilitating an orderly transition to a subsequent contractor.  Offeror’s proposals should demonstrate related ability and experience for monitoring clinical sites and their pharmacies and laboratories; training site staff in policy, procedures and good clinical practices; monitoring domestic and international clinical sites; ability to recruit a full monitoring staff within four months of contract award with minimum Bachelor’s Degree or equivalent in nursing, pharmacy, biology or other biomedical sciences; sufficient number of monitors possessing special international site monitoring qualifications; adequacy and availability of professional staff other than monitors; and documented evidence of successful organizational experience in providing monitoring services for multi-site clinical trials.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2004, and require an estimated 9 to 10 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Submit offers on RFQ4009.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-17.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern (NAICS-339111). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure, using simplified acquisition procedures, the following items: (1) DNA Engine Thermal Cycler Base (requires 1 alpha unit)- qty 1,  (2) 96-well Gradient Alpha unit, holds one 96-well plate or 96 x 0.2 ml tubes- qty 1, (3) 48/48 Dual Alpha Unit Holds 2 x 48 x .02 ml tubes, (4) 96-well unskirted plates, package of 25, (5) Microseal B sealing film, package of 100, (6) Sealing Roller Tool, (7) PTC-100 96-well thermal cycler, HotBonnet.  System requirements include a system that has no moving optical parts, instead of a scanning CCD camera, for optical measurements and a temperature gradient sample block, which allows for condition optimization in a single experimental run. These features are necessary to perform quantitative PCR and RT PCR experiments. These features are necessary because a continuous signal increases data quality (no moving optical parts) and condition optimization can be found in a single experimental run (temperature gradient sample block). The DNA Engine Opticon 2 System is a continuous fluorescence detection system that utilizes a thermoelectric Peltier-Joule heat pump module for all heating and cooling operations with multi-sensor/multi-zone temperature control technology, thermal accuracy of 0.3C, well-to-well uniformity of 0.4C, accommodating 96 samples, in place or strip tube format, with optional programming of a thermal gradient of up to 24C, across the 96-well sample block, yielding less than 0.4C variation from the predicted temperature.  The research also requires a continuous fluorescence detection system that excites fluorescent dyes with absorption spectra in the 450 to 505 nm range, and optimized for dyes with emission spectra in the first channel of 533/20 nm range, and in the second channel 540-700 nm range.  Especially important is the capability to excite samples sequentially with 96 LEDs, and detect each signal via two photomultiplier tubes (PMT) individually, without any moving parts, in order to ensure robustness of data collection.  The Thermal Cyclers, including Alpha Units, will need to come with standard 2-year parts and labor warranty.  Government-designated personnel will address any problems noted directly to the contractor.  The procedures that will be used in awarding this contract will be by written quotations or solicitations. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) warranty, 3) technical capability to meet required specifications.  The anticipated award date is December 9, 2003.  Place of delivery – NIH/NIAID, Maryland 20892.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Yuanxing, Manager Senior Engineer, Equipment Management Dept., China Railway Container Transport Center, No.6,Beifengwo,Haidian District, Room 2218 CCECC PLAZA,Beijing China, Tel: 010 51876552, Fax: 010 51892710, E-mail: yx@crct.com.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study to analyze China’ railway intermodal transport system and recommend options for improvements of the transport system.
 
China's railroads handle more freight than U.S. railways, despite the fact that China's rail network is only about 1/3 the size of the U.S. network.  Approximately 1.5 million employees work for China's railways, which currently have an emphasis on transporting heavy, low value commodities.  In 1995, the Ministry of Railways (MOR) established the China Railways Container Transport Center (CRCTC) to be responsible for all rail container transport operations.  To help facilitate these operations, China plans to develop a network of 18 major intermodal terminals, 40 specialized container terminals with logistics capabilities, and 200 container handling stations.  The proposed study would look at a number of technical issues that need to be resolved before this network can be implemented:  operations of international intermodal container transport; solutions for freight yard arrangements; selection of crane systems and related technologies; development a management information system for container transport; and development of new intermodal transport, such as double stack container operations and RoadRailer® (which allows for easy transition from rail to truck transport) operations.  These technologies could help reduce costs by as much as 25-40%.

Modern logistics are relatively new to China and have the potential to speed up economic development and progress through the use of information technology and intermodal vehicles.  The development of a railway tracking system would have a direct and significant impact on economic development and foreign trade for all areas of China.   Both the MOR and the CRCTC have developed transport management systems to track containers thereby providing security and better service to customers.  However, the MOR has yet to develop a container tracking and security system that will relay real-time information about container whereabouts.  The proposed study will design a system that will encompass a broader spectrum of the logistics supply chain, by allowing the MOR and CRCTC to track cargo and containers from overseas to final destination throughout the country. 

In the past, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have commissioned studies on improving railway networks in China.  Many of their recommendations will be studied and examined in the course of this feasibility study.  One World Bank study notes that China's interior does not currently enjoy the benefits of container transport.  Only approximately 8% of all seaborne containers that arrive on China's East coast travel beyond the coastal regions.  It states that a study focused on container transport development would directly contribute to the elimination of economic disparities between the coastal and interior regions.  The proposed project would help to develop an efficient intermodal container transport network to address these disparities and improve the rail industry's competitiveness.

The Feasibility Study Terms of Reference (TOR) are as follows:

1.	Data Gathering
1a.	Review of Current Operations
1b.	Market Measurement

Tel: 5255-5786-9708, fax: 5255-5786-9533, e-mail: ricardo.tapia@asa.gob.mx.
The Grantee is soliciting technical proposals (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from qualified U.S. firms to provide expert consulting services to carry out a feasibility study for Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) on the proposed Ciudad Obregón International Airport (COIA) Expansion project. 

ASA is the Mexican national airport operator.  As part of the airport privatization process initiated in 1997, the Mexican government has awarded 50-year concessions for three regional groups of airports.  ASA’s Corporate Network continues to operate the remaining 28 regional airports that were not included in the regional packages and ASA is involved in the operation of the Mexico City International Airport.  ASA’s mission is to establish and develop business strategies that bring added value and to improve the level of services at Mexico’s 28 regional airports, which serve 2.02 million passengers, with 227,000 operations per year.  To that end, ASA has identified several regional airports that represent significant commercial and regional development opportunities.  ASA’s airport development model is based on a strategic alliance between the state government, ASA, and the private sector.    

The objective of this project is to assist ASA and local partners in increasing the cargo capacity at the COIA which in turn will lead to increased development in the region.  The COIA currently lack the capacity for meeting the shipment needs for a number of producers of fishery products, canning products, and for industrial expansion in the area.  Consequently, as envisioned by the project sponsors, there is a potential for maximizing the utility of the airport cargo expansion by including the construction of multi-modal transshipment facilities to the list of installation facilities to be added as part of this project.

The improvements for which financing was requested include an airport cargo hub with runways, taxiways, warehouse facilities, chilling rooms, customs warehouse, maintenance and service station facilities, infrastructure for industrial and training facilities, hangars and roofed parking for private places, multi-modal terminal, and an industrial park.  The estimated project cost is $99 million for the initial development phase and $199 million over a twenty-year development period.  The expansion project will increase the trade capacity of the state of Sonora which supports more than 350 manufacturing plants and a broad-based agriculture and fishing industry.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the improvement and expansion of the Ciudad Obregón International Airport should include the following tasks:

Task 1: 	Inventory of Existing Conditions and Meetings
Task 2:		Aviation Demand Forecasts
Task 3:		Requirements Analysis and Concepts Development
Task 4:		Environmental Impact Analysis
Task 5:		Implementation Plan
Task 6:		Financial Analysis
Task 7:		Reporting

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $450,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture Project Technical AssistanceThe Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the Mexican Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT), in the assessment of the technical and financial viability of a national intelligent ITS architecture plan.

The SCT is the Ministry responsible for the national transportation system in Mexico, and as such, it has under its jurisdiction the responsibility for the development, implementation and integration of ITS in Mexico.  The Mexican highway system is currently the most important means of transporting cargo and passengers (80% of land cargo and 98% of passengers) in and around the country.  However, to date, Mexico is awash in what the Undersecretary of SCT calls a “growing anarchy and unorganized array of ITS applications”.  Since 1992, Mexico has attempted to meet their transportation needs through the application of several strong yet disjointed systems: Automated Vehicle Identification systems (IAVE), Global Positioning System (GPS), Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), etc.  These systems, and many others, have been used to streamline toll plazas, border crossing stations, cargo truck tracking, rail tracking systems, public transportation and metro systems in Mexico City, temporary vehicle importation regulations and other regional and national programs aimed at modernizing and managing the complex grid of Mexico’s transportation system.  In the end, each of these projects was designed to meet the specific trade and traffic needs of one or two particular programs rather than for the whole nation – short-term solutions lacking long-term insight.

The objective of this project is to define an ITS deployment plan based on a national architecture that will take into account the needs for a communications network, detection systems, traffic management  (other ITS components) and the institutional structure necessary to integrate the systems.  The Technical Assistance will consider the legal barriers that could potentially impact the deployment of the ITS systems, but more important, the review and definition of the financial mechanisms that would insure the expansion of ITS systems in Mexico.  Finally, the Technical Assistance will evaluate the latest ITS technologies available, and identify the manufacturers, suppliers and vendors of systems, services, and equipment technology in the current ITS market.

The SCT´s primary objective is that all ITS in the country be carried out in an integrated, compatible, and interoperable manner for the betterment of all modes of mobility within the country and its geographical borders.  The SCT has recognized this need for integration, and as such will depend on the Technical Assistance to develop a national and regional ITS Architecture in order to maximize the benefit for highway, rail, and port users as well as for the growth of the regions in Mexico.  With an established ITS Architecture, Mexico will be able to formalize a structure and standards to satisfy current and future ITS applications in the country.  

The Technical Assistance will assist the SCT in evaluating the seven key regions within Mexico for the use of ITS technology; however, of particular importance to the SCT is the U.S.-Mexican border crossing. Since entering into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, Mexico’s transportation needs have increased significantly and emphasis has been placed in solving freight and passenger traffic.  As a result, several ITS type installations have taken place at the U.S.-Mexican border area.  These systems include customs facilitation systems, vehicle tracking and control and automated inspection equipment.  The intent is to facilitate and expedite the constant and increased movement of freight and passenger between the United States and Mexico.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following: 

Task 1: 	Review of Existing Conditions and Define Goals and Objectives
Task 2:		Review Institutional, Legal and Regulatory Issues
Task 3:		Technical Analysis
Task 4:		Economical and Financial Analysis
Task 5:		Environmental Benefits
Task 6:		Development of Systems’ Requirements and Capabilities
Task 7:		Development of an ITS Architecture
Task 8:		Proposed Systems and Services
Task 9:		Development of an “Action Plan” for ITS Implementation
Task 10:	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $431,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Desk Study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  	Dipl. Ing. Bc. Jiri Jez, State Enterprise Director, DIAMO, s.p., Machova 201, 471 27  Straz pod Ralskem, Czech Republic, Phone: +420 487 851 336, Fax: +420 487 851 456.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for remediation of a former uranium mill site.

The MAPE uranium mill was closed in November 1991 after nearly thirty years of processing uranium ores and deposition of milling wastes in two nearby ponds at the site.  It is estimated that approximately 36 million tons of contaminated mill tailings, covering an area of 285 hectares (over 30 million sq. feet), were created during the mill operations and deposited in the area. These ponds threaten the health and safety of the city of Ceske Budejovice and potentially millions of Czechs who live downstream.  

There are several major issues to be addressed at the closure of a uranium processing mill such as MAPE.  These include safe disposition of a) contaminated water with high concentrations of various minerals including radium, b) contaminated sludge, which forms dust prone deposits after dewatering, and c) contaminated scrap and demolition material from the processing plant.

The Czech Ministry of the Industry and Trade, which is responsible for the MAPE closure, entrusted its enterprise DIAMO with closure of the MAPE.  Conceptual project documentation, addressing technical and socio-economical aspects of the closure and analyzing various alternatives and risks, has been under development since 1996. 

At this time, the MAPE project is at the juncture where several implementation and technological alternatives exist to achieve the desired objectives.  DIAMO and the Czech government would like to draw on the extensive US experience in similar closure projects.  This Feasibility Study will involve a US contractor reviewing existing documentation, examining the site and making a recommendation of the most feasible implementation alternatives and technologies for the MAPE closure.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $245,900 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>D--Request for Information (RFI) 
for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) DoD-wide Enterprise License 


SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) for an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability designed to resolve the vulnerability management issues and configuration management concerns across the Department of Defense (DoD). This capability should address the following vulnerability processes: (1) assessment, (2) compliance, (3) reporting, and (4) remediation.  Responses are due to this RFI by 16:00 hrs Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 1 December 2003.  

DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), at the request of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and in support of National Security goals established by the President, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) enterprise-wide capability across the Department of Defense (DoD).  This capability should fully integrate Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) vulnerability identification, verification, reporting, and remediation, while providing a cost effective training method to employ the technology.  Emphasis should include the capability to employ these tools in all operating environments, such as specified in the Defense Information Infrastructure / Common Operating Environment (DII COE).

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

·Description of a conceptual architecture to include logistical tail requirements such as training, maintenance, installation, technical support
·Technical feasibility assessments
·Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for core architecture and possible alternatives
·Schedule estimates (capability ready for deployment)
·Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, deploying and managing this IAVM solution

ACQUISITION STRATEGY


While the government is soliciting information from all of industry, the government intends to satisfy this requirement by placing a task order under an existing multiple award ID/IQ contract.  The existing contract the Government intends to use is the Information Assurance (IASSURE) contracts.  Information on this contract, including contract terms and conditions, ordering procedures and prime contractors can be found at http://www.disa.mil/acq/contracts/iachar.html. 
The IASSURE contract has 11 prime contractors and has the flexibility of prime contractors being able to add subcontractors to their team at any time.  Companies interested in becoming a subcontractor under the IASSURE contract should contact one of the 11 prime contractors directly.  Point of contact for the companies can also be found on the above IASSURE website.



REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the basic minimum functional requirements for this IAVM capability.  
(1) Automated Vulnerability Identification and Reporting
System Administrators (SA’s) must have tools that automate the tasks of asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting.  These tools must also provide the SA with step-by-step instructions appropriate for the platform to facilitate ease of installation and configuration operations.  In addition, adequate help facilities (help pages) should be imbedded within the product to provide vulnerability information concerning the tasks above and possible remediation techniques. Tool should have a remote management capability. Having the above capabilities would greatly reduce the burden placed upon SA’s.

Tools for asset identification, IAVA identification, and IAVA reporting should also be able to run on “Microsoft, major Unix based, Linux, and Cisco operating systems and should be able to scan Nortel, Foundry, Enterasys, Cabletron, and Marconi network infrastructure devices”.  New vulnerabilities surface on a regular basis and these tools must keep abreast of these changes.  New vulnerability alerts must be continually updated to be able to validate the solutions and links required for remediation of all vulnerabilities.  All DoD IAVAs are currently stored in a vulnerability database, and new ones are added as they are released.  Storage of all information in an SQL-addressable database should be supported and allow direct custom queries, or export / linking capability to other databases.  Reports should be available on any machine with a DoD approved web browser. These tools should include differential reporting capabilities based on host or vulnerability with customizable scans for IAVA compliance and service configurable scans. Tool should also have a hierarchical reporting capability.

Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts (IAVAs) are only available to .mil sites and not the commercial marketplace.  

The IAVM tools must be able to be configured to check for updates over the network every time they are run. In addition to adding vulnerability checks, the tools should validate the solutions and links provided in the screens and reports of the product with each update, minimizing the possibility that the user may encounter a broken link. These tools should also include the ability to identify vulnerabilities
associated with Routers, Switches and network printers.
Differential reporting capabilities based on Host or Vulnerability
should be included.
(2) Vulnerability Remediation
A key consideration in this IAVM capability is that your proposed suite of vulnerability assessment, compliance and tracking tools must be interoperable with multiple remediation tools. These remediation tools should support the largest number of possible operating systems and applications that DoD uses. Based on the product you propose please identify the remediation tools in which your product is interoperable.
(3) Field Proven Tools
Scanning for vulnerabilities must quickly determine IAVA compliance on a network. Coupled with a central reporting capability, an enterprise solution should provide an effective means to enforce IAVA compliance.  Any selected vulnerability discovery tool at the SA level should be able to be utilized “under” the security routers in an organization's top-level architecture as well as within smaller enclaves that may be protected by firewalls and other security devices that are part of the DoD defense-in-depth posture.  Enterprise tools must work in deployable, tactical, and isolated units in remote theaters, with a small (e.g., 256 KBps) satellite link with up to 600ms delay.
(4) Non-Disruptive to Normal Operations
These IAVM tools must be able to be run on live networks during normal operating hours without affecting the user's mission.  These tools must be able to be used during normal operating hours so there is no need to scan at night while users are away and there is a worry about machines being turned off during off-duty hours. Basically these tools should not be disruptive to the operating environment.
(5) Accountability and Enforcement
Requirement for this part of the IAVM capability should be that whenever a System Administrator performs a network IAVA scan, a status report should be sent to one or more enterprise IAVM data repositories. 

Examples of information that should be presented in the status report are as follows: (First and foremost is the IAVA compliance data on network assets within the System Administrator’s purview)

·The time and date the scan was performed should be available
·The version of the products used to perform the scan should be available

The complete data set must also allow a Security Manager to monitor IAVA compliance by showing:

·If the System Administrator scanned his network
·When they scanned the network
·If the System Administrator scanned using the most up-to-date tool, and hence scanned for the most recent IAVAs
·What IAVAs are still outstanding?
·What IAVAs have been applied?
(6) Training/Technical Support for IAVM Implementation
Past experience within DoD deploying IA tools has proven that without training, a large percentage of tools remain “on the shelf” and do not get used, resulting in a poor return on investment.  In addition, most IAVM mechanisms are powerful tools that, if not properly employed, have the potential to harm a network with a single click.

To provide tool and IAVA specific training on particularly complex IAVA “fixes,” a capability must be provided for virtual, interactive, on-demand IA training to SAs from their duty location/organization computers.  Students should be able to log into a “virtual interactive classroom” using a number of teaching tools (e.g., streaming video/audio, online classroom chat, web boards, and virtual servers).  Students should also be able to log into a virtual classroom from anywhere in the world. It is imperative that students should learn to run IAVM tools and do compliance reporting on a virtual network before ever touching their real network. 

This capability should compliment training presented at formal DoD IA training schools by training specific technical IAVA requirements.  Whenever changes occur in the tools the training should be updated, reducing the lag time that now occurs in updating/improving individual technical skills. 

This capability should be available to the Government in the following:

·Availability of an enterprise license 
·Availability of enterprise maintenance
·24 X 7 X 365 day technical support: Because this tool will be fielded world-wide please submit information on how you would provide technical support for both CONUS and OCONUS theaters and in multiple environments (i.e., Garrison environment, tactical environment, ships, aircrafts…etc)
(7) Enterprising View of Vulnerabilities
The Security Manager in an organization should be provided with an enterprise view of the DoD security posture.  Query capabilities, such as “Show me the status of an “X IAVA on “X platform”, should be provided within an enterprise view by the IAVM capability.

The intent of the DoD network architecture should allow multiple IAVM tools to be deployed throughout the enterprise, while maintaining a central repository for vulnerability information. Communications to the central repository should be encrypted.  In addition, all interactions with the enterprise database through the standard user interface should be encrypted.

(8) National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Certification Process

This capability must have completed or initiated the NIAP Certification process (GOAL: Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4 certification)

SUMMARY
The goal of this RFI is to seek information that will assist in the development and deployment of an IAVM enterprise-wide capability.  This effort’s intent is to give DoD a tool suite to proactively, efficiently, and effectively manage their IAVM Program, which will reduce the workload on both system administrators (SA) and network managers (NM) alike.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit on a full and open competition basis the purchase of a pulsed femtosecond (fs) laser to expand our current  capabilities in manufacturing research.  It will be used to explore behavior of early stage energetic reactions, possible new energetic systems and  support of future biomedical and material science and engineering research. The system must allow for future expansion and begin with the purchase of two components.  The first is a base unit that provides a pulse of less than 100 fs with a peak power of approximately 0.1 TeraWatt.  The second component should expand the tunable wavelenghth response to the 189nm - 2600nm range. An example would be a 0.1 TeraWatt peak power that would be coupled to an  appropriate tuning system such as titanium doped sapphire.  Future additions will incude an amplifier to boost peak power to greater than 1 TerraWatt. POC at Picatinny Arseanl is Cathy Kallistros, ckallis@pica.army.mil,973- 724-5016.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Ms. Kathleen Signaigo, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire management analysis support for a period of 12 months, with one 12-month option, to assist CIT’s executive office in management analysis activities relating to administrative services and workforce planning . Ms. Signaigo will have responsibility for developing long and short-range plans on human capital issues and resolving organizational and human resources issues.  She will plan, design, and perform or oversee studies and analyses related to functional areas of responsibility, operating methods, procedures, and utilization of resources.

CIT is seeking the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of CIT’s unique and complex IT resource issues who can successfully accomplish the following tasks:  

•	As a consultant to the CIT senior level administrative management team, provide support to planning deliberations and decisions concerning the allocation and administration of the Center’s human resources. Serve in an advisory capacity to the CIT Executive Officer in the development of long and short-range plans, programs and activities on human capital issues and the solution of organizational and human resources problems. 

•	Support efforts to plan, design and oversee or perform studies and analyses of management/operational functions related to functional areas of responsibility, operating methods, procedures, utilization of resources, etc., to identify potential problem areas where improvement is desirable. Develop constructive solutions responsive to the demands of a sound human resources management program and the CIT mission.  The analyst conducts a wide range of critical analytical studies of an administrative or human capital nature for the Center. In the past, this has included recent projects/studies such as CIT’s annual Hiring Plan, annual HR review process, managing CIT’s IT freeze request listings, the “A-76 study”, and IT sensitivity coverage.  Future studies may include studies on the alternatives to providing coverage in the NIH Data Center, succession planning, IT core competencies, evaluation of the CIT training program, redesign of the CIT performance management system, and management review on use of delegated authorities

•	Support the development of reorganizations, realignments and other changes affecting the structure or allocation of CIT’s HR resources.  Review and provide advice concerning the creation of reorganization packages, performs analyses of proposed structure and suggests alignment of staff resources to best satisfy program needs.

•	Provide assistance in helping CIT transition from a full service hands on highly customer oriented HR activity to the new NIH Consolidated HRO Organization.   Develop internal policies and procedures to meet CIT goals and objectives, improve the organizational effectiveness of activities, coordinate with the DHRO operations team providing service to the CIT to coordinate, facilitate and/or negotiate issues of importance dealing with pending HR issues and provide program officials with the information needed to manage their human capital in an effective manner. Develop strategies and procedures to implement NIH wide personnel management policies and procedures, determining implications for CIT, developing modifications responsive to the particular requirements of CIT, as necessary, and ways of explaining policies to staff.

•	 Help identify human capital needs of the Center and assists management in determining how to initiate actions to satisfy those needs. Specifically this includes, but is not limited to: reviewing newly proposed position descriptions & vacancy announcements, or crediting plans for senior or unique positions only, reviewing proposed retention allowance requests, or Title 42 stipend increases.
 
•	On a routine basis provide advice and counsel to the Executive Officer on a broad range of administrative matters.  Serve as a principal advisor, facilitator and resource person, ensuring that responsibilities within the areas of, administrative delegations, senior level compensation, position management, personal services contracts, performance management, etc. are carried out, regulations adhered to, problems and issues are resolved and properly coordinated by NIH Human Resources or other NIH administrative staff. 

•	Help support CIT’s performance management systems in developing procedures and information to ensure that managers and supervisors are well informed of the requirements of SES, IPP, Title 42 and Commissioned Corps performance management systems. Provide advice on the development of effective performance contracts/plans and works with program officials to assure the systematic evaluation and reward of employees covered under established performance systems. 

CIT has determined that Ms. Signaigo possesses the unique combination of knowledge, skills and abilities and understanding of the CIT organization and human resource and management needs to successfully accomplish the specified tasks.  She has been providing a combination of management and human resource advisory, technical and operational services for over 25 years.  She has worked directly with CIT senior managers over the last six years in providing a full range of human resource and management services in areas related to CIT organizational development, workforce planning, human resource planning reviews, performance contract/performance management, employee relations, recruitment, classification, compensation, IT personnel security, training and a variety of special project areas.  Based on her personal knowledge of the evolution of the CIT, her unique grasp of the information technology services provided by the various operating divisions of the CIT, her active participation with key management officials, and her standing and expertise in the community, she has been able to independently perform these tasks and present management completed work products.  Ms. Signaigo has worked closely with CIT Office and Division Directors, including the CIT Executive Officer in providing expert level support to requests from the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requiring in-depth knowledge of the types of IT services provided by CIT, the categorization of the competencies possessed by CIT staff, and ability to translate that information into meaningful responses.  By virtue of her previous experience, Ms. Signaigo has an in-depth understanding of the organizational and HR needs of CIT to fulfill its mission which, in part, is to (1) provide leadership at NIH for the determination of NIH computational and telecommunications needs, (2) maintain a state-of-the-art regional computer facility, (3) provide leadership and focus within NIH for the development and implementation of IT policy and standards, and (4) serve as a Federal Data Processing Center.  During a recent requirement to move all CIT managers and supervisors to performance contracts, Ms. Signaigo served as the key resource in developing those contracts and metrics used in individual performance contracts and in ensuring consistency across the CIT.  While employed with CIT, she served as the Deputy Human Resource Officer and was a key advisor to CIT management on highly sensitive issues in the areas of human resources, especially employee relations.  By successfully managing several complex cases, and serving as the lead advisor to other HR staff, CIT was able to establish a record of dealing fairly and appropriately with performance and conduct related issues.  Her advice and expertise on these cases also increased her standing with management officials in successfully working to correct these kinds of problems.  With the centralization of HR services, the CIT has had to reorient the delivery of several areas of HR that are not provided by the central HR office.  Ms. Signaigo has been able to effectively work with CIT staff in redeploying assignments throughout the CIT as appropriate and developing policies and procedures to implement these decentralized services.  CIT has determined that based upon her previous experience and expertise, Ms. Signaigo will not require orientation to CIT’s organizational and HR activities and issues, and is the only source with the unique qualifications who can successfully accomplish the specified tasks.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to BAA04-03 is to notify Proposers of new Evaluation Criteria for award selection, and to make an administrative correction to Modification 2 that was previously published.  The following is applicable:  DELETE:  The due date for consideration for funding during the First Selections Phase is extended from 12:00pm local time on 19 DEC 03, to 12:00pm local time on 9 JAN 03.  INSERT:  The due date for consideration for funding during the First Selections Phase is extended from 12:00pm local time on 19 DEC 03, to 12:00pm local time on 9 JAN 04.  DELETE:  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following five (5) criteria:  1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, 2) Contribution to DARPA/ATO Mission, 3) Proposers Capabilities and Related Experience, 4) Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, 5) Cost Realism.  Technical factors (Overall Scientific and Technical Merit and Contribution to DARPA Mission) are considered more important than non-technical factors (Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience, Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, and Cost Realism).  INSERT:  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against six (6) evaluation criteria, which are listed in order of importance.  These criteria are as follows:  1) Technical Approach - The proposer's Technical Approach will be evaluated to determine the extent that the proposed technology maturation effort, and/or prototype development and testing, enables the ORCLE vision and meets the program objectives and goals discussed in Section 2.0 of the ORCLE solicitation (BAA04-03).  The proposer must show a credible technical approach to achieving the Go/No Go Criteria within the stated timeframe; 2) Operational Utility - The proposer's description of the potential contribution to warfighting effectiveness enabled by the proposed solution will be evaluated; 3) Concept of Operations - The proposer's Military and Technical Concept of Operations for the proposed system will be evaluated.   The Military Concept of Operations should be consistent with emerging visions for future warfighting capabilities and the Technical Concept of Operations should support the Military Concept; 4) Management Approach - The proposer's Management Approach will be evaluated to ensure that overall sound methodologies and lean, efficient management practices will be used to complete ORCLE successfully.  This evaluation area will also consider the proposer's Program Plan and accomplishment criteria;            5) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA/ATO Mission - The objective of this criterion is to establish a strong link between this work and the DoD mission.  It is NOT necessary that the proposed work be immediately usable in military systems.  It is only necessary that this work contribute to technical areas of need by the DoD.  Dual use of technology enabling DoD systems to ride on commercial development practice is key to keeping the cost of DoD systems low; 6) Cost Realism - The Offeror's Cost Proposal will be evaluated based on the extent to which the proposed costs reasonably, completely, and realistically reflect the ORCLE activities described in the Proposers Information Pamphlet and BAA.

<DESC>Solicitation /Synopsis:  This combined solicitation/synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.

THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE:  A complete pulse-jet dust collector system Torit Model 81MBW10 or equal.  The system shall be capable of providing continuous on-line cleaning for a volumetric flow rate of 11000 SCFM.  The collector system shall operate at an air-to-media ratio of 8.5 :1 (FPM).  The model shall include 10’ filter bags.  The pulse-jet bag collector shall be supplied in factory-assembled units sized to meet airflow capacities and design requirements. The collector shall have a bolted and welded construction using 12 gauge HRS and designed for a +/- 20” water gauge. The unit shall come complete with pulse-jet pipework, 1” single diaphragm valves, pilot solenoid valves in NEMA control boxes, 4” square x 3/16 wall square tubing compressed air manifold, 4”x 4”structural support legs with cross-bracing, lifting lugs and discharge hoppers with 18” x 18” inside dimension flanged discharge openings with a minimum angle of 60 degree from horizontal.  The backside of the hopper shall be a quick opening 22” diameter hopper access door for each hopper.

<DESC>The following are the questions that were posed concerning the subject solicitation.  The answers immediately follow the questions. If you have any further questions, please contact SSgt Jennifer Nalls at (830) 298-4965 or email at jennifer.nalls@laughlin.af.mil or contact Mr. James Harper at (830) 298-5175 or email at james.harper@laughlin.af.mil. The response date has been extended to 15 December 2003 @ 1630 CST.

1. What is the size and weight of the bearings?


1’ to 51/2’ in diameter – variable weights not to exceed 1 pound.

2. What does demagnetizing mean?  Does it mean to prevent magnetizing or marring or does it mean to demagnetize already magnetized parts?


Demagnetizing was meant to convey that the system will need to be able to demagnetize bearings that have various levels of magnetization, (all bearing acquire magnetizing to various degrees).

3. Is a batch system or singly conveyed system desired?


A batch system is desired to enhance productivity.

4. Is it possible to visit the base and review the operations of the shop in question?


Yes, but please keep in mind that the government will not fund a site visit.  We ask that all site visits be conducted 5 days prior to the response date.  This is so that there are no more extensions to the response date. 

5. Is it possible to obtain drawings or photos of the bearings?  


Yes, they are attached to this amendment.

6. Is there a basic design or concept in mind?  


A dynamic flow multi-stage unit that washes, demagnetizes, rinses, and then saturates the bearing with protective oil at conclusion of process.

7. Will some of the bearings have splines on i.d. or o.d.?


No

8. Are the bearings enclosed or needle bearing type?  


The bearings are either roller or ball.  Most of them are retained.

9. Who manufactures the bearings?  


Various manufactures to include but not limited to New Hampshire Bearing Company and Timken.

10. What are the recommended/permissible cleaning chemicals and fluid temperatures from the manufacturer? 


Armakleen m-hp-2 has been approved for our application by our engineering section.

11. What is the approximate average amount of oil and grease in each bearing in ounces?


There are trace amounts of oil and grease.

12. Who is the manufacturer of the current cleaning material and what is it?
 

What we are currently using does not adequately clean.  It is PD-680.  This is why we have requested Armakleen m-hp-2 solvent.

13. Is bearing pre-cleaned to remove excessive grease etc before washing?


No, the unit must be designed to handle the cleaning required.  There are no greased bearings since all are lubricated with 7808 oil.  Our biggest concern is removing the carbon from hot section bearings.

MUNITIONS FOR LOW COLLATERAL DAMAGE APPLICATIONS
The Ordnance Integration Branch (MNMI) is interested in a concept definition/exploration study of munitions technologies for use in Low Collateral Damage (LCD) applications.  These munitions concepts should consider light to medium armored military targets placed in an urban setting, while minimizing collateral damage to the surrounding civilian assets.  These technologies may be applied to munitions under development as well as to system designs in current operation.  Areas of particular interest are warhead cases (i.e. design, materials), weapon airframes, weapon payloads/kill mechanisms, fuzing, and integration of such components.

Other selection criteria will be evaluated concerning streamline efficient organization (mix of core project staff including licenses); access to specialist on an as needed basis; location of project management personnel; knowledge of the New World Mining District and the geology, hydrogeology and high altitude reclamation concerns; specific work experience in high altitude mining reclamation projects; and working knowledge of Wyoming and Montana state water quality, waste disposal and appropriate environmental laws.

Projects will be negotiated prior to starting work and will be on an individual order basis for the period March 1, 2004, through March 1, 2005, with options to extend the services for up to four additional 12-month periods. 

                                                                     



SCOPE-OF-WORK

The work will include investigations and studies in support of response and restoration actions at the New World Mining District site.  The contractor will be expected to be familiar with all phases of time-critical and non-time critical removal actions as described in 40 CFR 300.  The types of work most likely to be ordered include the completion of site investigation and characterization studies, Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA), continuing water quality and vegetation monitoring, and construction design and support activities.

Site Investigation and Characterization

The contractor will be expected to perform field sampling to determine the level and extent of contamination and then, identify contamination pathways and targets at risk.  The contractor is expected to be familiar with EPA protocol, Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) requirements, and other applicable sampling requirements needed to produce the proper level of data quality.  The contractor will be expected to complete Sampling and Analysis Plans (SAP) and data quality objectives (DQOs) that will be reviewed and approved by the Forest Service and EPA.  

The Contractor shall assume financial responsibility for re-sampling if data is unusable because of identified problems with sampling techniques, handling or shipping problems, sampling requirements (insufficient sample material collected, inappropriate sample preservation, inappropriate sample location), laboratory error or laboratory contamination.

Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA)

The contractor is expected to be familiar with current technologies suitable for dealing with waste rock dumps, mill tailings, and other mine-related wastes.  In particular, the contractor is expected to have experience and be familiar with containment design, modeling of leachate quantities through various containment designs, and related reclamation practices.  

We expect the EE/CAs to be focused documents that evaluate in-depth a limited number of alternatives.  The streamlined risk assessments will include no more information than is needed to show a risk exists and a response action is justified.  In addition, the contractor needs to be familiar with Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) for each project and how to evaluate whether they need to be considered and then, if the proposed response action will meet them.

Construction Design and Support

The contractor will be expected to design a response action at a site.  This task will require the contractor to complete engineering plans and specifications that are suitable for bid advertisement.  The contractor will be expected to complete a Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC) plan, if needed, for the construction work.  The contractor may also be requested to review bid documents and construction submittals; and complete a final construction report, post construction monitoring plan, and an operation and maintenance plan.

However, specific timeframes for these tasks will be negotiated.
The Forest Service will generally return comments to the contractor within two weeks of receipt of a document.  The contractor will be responsible for incorporating all comments or explaining why a comment was not incorporated.

Other Tasks

Other tasks involve work in support of natural resource damage assessments, removal/remedial site evaluations, community relations (plans), action memorandums, serving as an on-site inspector during construction, inventory of suspected CERCLA sites, water quality and vegetation monitoring and reporting, and other related studies and field work.  Timeframes for these tasks will be negotiated. 

All Tasks

For all work ordered under this activity, the contractor will be expected to be familiar with affected and interested State agencies and laws/rules.  The contractor is expected to be familiar with applicable federal laws/regulations and the latest EPA guidance for any work requested under this activity.   

The contractor is expected to attend, participate, and possibly give presentations at internal and public meetings, when requested.  All personnel who will physically work on a site under this activity shall be certified as having received the 40-hour Hazardous Waste Site Operations training, in compliance with OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and are current on the certification.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) 	The United States Air Force, 88 Air Base Wing, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  is seeking potential sources to provide administrative support services to  perform duties in an international travel office to include functions such as  ticketing and orders preparation, modification or cancellation of both foreign  and domestic travel; application of Government protocols; formulation of  itineraries, and security requirements when applied to international travel.  Duties also include the maintenance and tracking of metrics (using office- automation technology) associated with foreign travel such as number of  travelers per month, number of countries visited, and number of visits to a  given country.  Customer satisfaction metrics will also be required.   Familiarity with personal computers, appropriate general-purpose and travel- specific databases; and general application software such as Microsoft Word,  Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power Point, Form Flow and Microsoft Outlook is  necessary.   The following knowledge is required:  foreign and domestic travel  requirements; appropriate government and commercial regulations, and foreign  embassy requirements for country clearances.  The emphasis of this support  service will be the ability to rapidly search for alternative solutions to  travel problems and to provide resolutions within the traveler’s time and  schedule constraints. This effort has been identified under OMB Circular A-76 and AFI 38-203, as a  potential direct conversion to contractor performance for the Air Force  Research Laboratory, Wright Site, the support-services arm of the five  directorates at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.   The Air Force anticipates  eventually conducting a competitive acquisition for the award of a contract.   This effort is expected to be a five-year contract, a basic effort with four  one-year options. 	Firms responding should indicate if they are a large business, a small  business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman-owned  business.  The general definition of a small business is one that is  independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in  which it is proposing on Air Force contracts and its affiliates; and the annual  receipts do not exceed $3M for the NAICS code, 561510.  The Air Force reserves  the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses to this  synopsis.  Small business respondents should provide a statement of  capabilities to assist the Air Force in making a set-aside decision.   Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign- owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national  employees on this effort. 	Any information submitted by respondents to this sources-sought  synopsis is voluntary.  The Air Force does not intend to award a contract on  the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited.   Respondents should not construe this synopsis as a commitment by the Air Force  for any purpose. 	All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that  demonstrates capabilities,   expertise, and relevant past performance (a  maximum of 3) relating to this effort as specified in paragraph one of this  synopsis.  Page limit for each response is 10 pages.  In addition, the response  should include the firm’s understanding of DOD and Air Force organizational  structure, roles and responsibilities. Address your approach to obtaining  security clearances. Provide company name, address, phone number, fax number, email address and  point of contact.  Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e- mail address: karen.schneder@wpafb.af.mil, john.shock@wpafb.af.mil or mail to:   88 ABW/PKD, Attn: Karen Schneder, 1940 Allbrook Dr., Ste 3, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH  45433-5109 or Attn: John Shock.  All responses should be received no  later than December 19, 2003.  Direct all questions concerning this synopsis to  Karen Schneder at (937) 257-6478 ext 4307 or John Shock ext 4388.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only.  55th Contracting Squadron is issuing this synopsis for the sole purpose of conducting Market Research in accordance with FAR Part 10.  

This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing engineering services for maintenance and enhancement of Multiple Engagement Module (MEM) for U. S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)/PR.  

MEM is used to model anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems and to conduct special studies involving strategic weapons.  MEM assesses the attrition of the ICBM/SLBM portion of an attack against ballistic missile defenses.  The model is operational and under continuous enhancement upgrades.  MEM is flexible, allowing evaluation of a variety of ABM system configurations and characteristics.  It is capable of simulating various engagement scenarios including nuclear weapons effects.  It is used in various war-gaming studies to analyze and predict future force structures and attack planning.  MEM is essential for nuclear war planning and analysis.  MEM requires maintenance and minor user enhancements. 

Work in progress includes core software maintenance, manuals, on-site training, and telephone technical support.  MEM requires continued modernization to ensure effective model operation, support for special applications, correction to code problems, improvements to maintain model currency, and to verify/validate existing model components.  Corrective or adaptive modifications may be required to MEM.  Other activities will involve enhanced support and performance improvements.  

Contractor must be capable of providing 24/7 uninterrupted service and support for the MEM software and the Analysis IPT.  This support includes monitoring of the operational environment.  

Contractor must be able to assume ongoing operational efforts and deliver in timeframes required. The contractor team performing these services must be certified and operate at a CMM SEI Level 4 or higher.  

Contractor will provide software configuration management and quality assurance for the MEM software.  Contractor shall be competent in applications and software networking, graphics modeling, (e.g., mapping systems and trajectory overlays), data base applications and software, software engineering and documentation, data communications, word processing, productivity tools for software development, software verification and validation techniques, graphics software and applications, software quality control and assurance techniques, and software programming capabilities in C and FORTRAN.
All software previously developed was in accordance with DODSTD-2167A (Expired), DOD HDBK 287 (Expired), Air Force standards and USSTRATCOM Strategic Administrative Instructions and will not be redeveloped with new standards unless determined necessary.  New software will follow Air Force standards and STRATCOM regulations or an agreed upon and documented process.  

Contractor personnel shall possess a working knowledge in computer hardware architecture to include: textual and graphics terminals, input/output processors, general communications and networking equipment, UNIX operating system on SUN workstations.

Contractor personnel shall possess a working knowledge of ICBM/SLBM nuclear modeling and shall incorporate in MEM any maintenance and enhancements to the software to include: modeling of nuclear weapons effects (NWEs), (e.g., prompt and delayed radiation, dust, fireball, blackout, redout, electromagnetic pulse (EMP)), cratering/overburden, and infrared/optical; radar modeling, netting, guidance/tracking, and impact predictions; vulnerability determinations; the modeling of BMD systems, (e.g., lasers, Kinetic Kill Vehicles(KKV)), interceptor time of flight (TOF); and high and low altitude ICBM/SLBM components, (e.g., booster through reentry modeling), reentry vehicle (RV) and chaff deployment/discrimination.

The contractor must maintain a TOP SECRET facility clearance with storage capacity for TOP SECRET documents and equipment.  All contractor personnel shall be a United States citizen and possess a TOP SECRET clearance.  Any contractor personnel required to work on the Strategic War Planning System (SWPS) computer system must have a TOP SECRET clearance with SBI and be SIOP/ESI briefed.  

It is anticipated that the resultant contract would be a base period and two option periods.

Request respondents capable of performing this effort furnish a capability statement of no more than 10 pages no later than 7 days from the date of this posting.  Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact with e-mail address, business size, DUNS number, CCR registration number, Federal Cage code, general description of the company, and description of similar contracts.  This RFI is not a commercial solicitation per FAR Part 12.  Address questions via e-mail to the contract specialist or contracting officer only.  No discussions will be conducted telephonically.

<SUBJECT>D -- PCGN (VSAT) Final Q&A
<DESC>Regarding the subject requirement (see 16 & 23 SEP, as well as 06 NOV 2003 notices for "Peace Corps Global Network by Very Small Aperture Terminal"), the following are further questions submitted by interested parties (Peace Corps technical point of contact is Michael Porter, T: 202/692-1340): Q11: Describe the Peace Corps’ ideal rollout/deployment schedule? What is the ideal start date for the first remote to be deployed? In which country? How many antennas (remotes) will be installed in each country? A11: Peace Corps contemplates beginning deployment in January 2004. The first countries would be the republics of Guinea, Chad, Niger, Kiribati, and Turkmenistan. Only one antenna per country is contemplated. Q12: Which countries will then be prioritized and how many remotes will Peace Corps need in each of those countries? A12: Peace Corps' telecommunications priority is the Voice/Data connection in Guinea. A system at that location is already in place but it needs to be stabilized, and then replaced. Q13: Does Peace Corps have an idea of how much bandwidth is going to be required for each location? Describe or characterize the number of users it supports in each location? Describe or characterize the types of data applications agency users require in each location? (Some examples might be e-mail, web applications, database applications, video conferencing). Is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) a current requirement? How many concurrent VoIP phone calls does the Peace Corps anticipate needing at each location? A13: A shared bandwidth of T-1 (digital transmission circuit) for the five (5) aforementioned sites is contemplated; however, the Govt acknowledges that satellite coverage may not apply to all sites. A minimum of 128/256kbs would be optimal for all offices to support TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol & Internet Protocol) services, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and voice. Peace Corps contemplates having two (2) outgoing voice connections per office for voice to be terminated in Peace Corps Washington DC headquarters. Q14: Would Peace Corps be interested in learning more about a virtual Centrex (central exchange) VoIP service? A14: Peace Corps invites interested parties to offer this technology as a potential solution. Q15: Many Segovia (see "www.SegoviaIP.com") clients understand that their mission requires mobility. Please clarify whether Peace Corps has a similar requirement. Also, is Peace Corps interested in learning more about mobile capabilities for voice and data? A15: Peace Corps invites interested parties to offer this technology as a potential solution. Q16: Requirement 1.1.6.4 on page 10 of the Statement of Work references the acronym "PAMA" but does not define it. Please clarify the acronym "PAMA." This requirement also states that the "…system shall not exceed 400 milliseconds (ms) under all possible link conditions and equipment configurations." Please clarify how that delay is currently calculated and does the satellite link also include that figure. It is noted that geosynchronous satellites orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the Earth and given that distance is traveled twice for each packet, an inherent minimum latency typically is typically between 500ms to 550ms. Please clarify whether the satellite link is or is not included in that number? A16: The two basic access technology alternatives are Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or Pre-Assigned Multiple Access/Demand Assigned Multiple Access (PAMA/DAMA). Peace Corps acknowledges latency over a VSAT connection is higher than normal connections; however, the agency contemplates the path to take as few transfers ("hops") as possible, in order to avoid network troubleshooting. Q17: Please clarify whether Peace Corps will consider a well-proven non-mesh TDMA alternative. A17: Peace Corps invites interested parties to offer this technology as a potential solution.  NOTE: the Question and Answer period is hereby closed, and no further questions will be considered. Peace Corps continues to invite interested parties to submit a technical proposal with cost elements (see 06 NOV 2003 notice regarding submission instructions, evaluation criteria, and procurement situation) by no later than Noon (12pm local Washington DC time) on Wednesday, 03 DEC 2003. Many thanks for your interest and support of Peace Corps' mission. Happy Thanksgiving.
