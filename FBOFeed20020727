<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service Albany,CA. has a requirement for a High-resolution capillary gel electrophoresis (CE) system coupled with LIP (laser-induced florescent detector characteristics include efficient temperature control of capillary column between 15 and 60 ?C
(:t 0.1 ?C). Temperature regulation mechanism must control samples (5 to 60?C) independently from the electrophoresis buffer.
Automated sample introduction uses following formats: 96 well plates autosampler vials, PCR vials, and tubes. Sample injection modes include electrokinetic, pressure and vacuum, with operation at either end of the capillary column.
Modes of separation must include: voltage, current, power, pressure and vacuum. All separations allow the programming of both linear and gradients along with the simultaneous application of pressure/vacuum. Must interface with a modular dual wavelength laser-induced fluorescence detection system. Software must provide (a) lower limits of quantitation with CEASAR integration algorithms, and (b) specialized CE calculations from actual
instrument generated data, including: apparent mobility, true mobility,corrected peak area, molecular weight, and iso-electric point. Interested firms can request a RFQ by mail or fax to the attention of Fred Gifford as listed in this notice.*****

Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.
