<DESC><p>This requirement is for design, analysis, fabrication, performance testing, and acceptance testing of the Infrared Source Translator (IST) and Collimator Optics Translator (COT). The IST and COT are major components of the Short Focal Length Collimator (SFLC) system, a new target simulation and background radiation projection system for the AEDC 7V Chamber. The SFLC will complement the existing 7V Chamber long focal length collimator. The SFLC design features a custom designed focal length to accommodate currently available thermal emitter arrays and to project simulated target images through a 1 degree by 1 degree field of view. The IST will be used to precisely position either an IR flood source or a thermal emitter array with respect to the SFLC collimator optics package. The COT will be used to position the SFLC collimator optics package either in its operate position or its stowed position inside the 7V Chamber. When the SFLC system is not required, it is necessary to stow the SFLC collimator to clear the IR beam paths of the existing 7V collimator. The IST and COT designs must address analysis of low temperature thermal and thermo/structural effects; selection and preparation of materials for cryogenic application and repeated thermal cycling; and control of contamination and optical surface reflection and scatter. The performance of each translator shall be demonstrated under high-vacuum, cryogenic operational conditions prior to final acceptance at AEDC. Delivery of the SFLC system is expected within 6 months following contract award. Delivery shall be FOB Destination to AEDC, Arnold AFB TN. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States/Canada Joint Certification Office, and have a legitimate business purpose may have a copy of the solicitation document. All requests for copies of the solicitation document must include a certified copy of DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. The solicitation package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in Block 3 of the DD Form 2345. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call the DLIS at (800) 352-3572. The DLIS United States/Canada Joint Certification Lookup service is available via the Internet at: www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/default.asp. The DD2345 may be faxed to 931-454-7330 or email your certification number to karen.hillstead@arnold.af.mil. All requests must be received by&nbsp;11 August 2009, 3:00 p.m. local time.</p>

The FALLS is a system utilized to determine the need for retest of launch vehicles by allowing accurate determination of location and intensity of lightning strikes. Period of performance is 120 to 150 days after contract award. This requirement is intended to be fulfilled through a sole source purchase order with Vaisala Inc, IAW FAR 6.302-1. Vaisala is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement. Vaisala is the only vendor who provides the capabilities of the FALLS system in a platform that will operate with the current CP8000 lightning processors and CGLAS lightning network. Vaisala does not offer the FALLS product through any other reseller or distributor. No solicitation documents exist at this time.

Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Vaisala Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement.

This is a Sole Source requirement with TIE Today, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1. TIE Today, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement as they currently have a purchase order in place to redesign the Equal Opportunity Advisor Program (EOAP) for DEOMI that they have been working on since June 2008. To initiate a new contract for this requirement with another company who would virtually have to start all over again to function within the established learning content management systems and learning management systems that TIE Today has been utilizing would be extremely costly to the government at this point in time. TIE Today should continue this as a follow on requirement to the initial purchase order to avoid a lapse in service to their customers or schedule disruptions. No solicitation documents exists at this time. This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 8299 with a business size of $7.0M and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611710.

<DESC><p>The George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany has a requirement to publish a new text book, the title of which is Toward A Grand Strategy Against Terrorism. It is an original work newly written by a team of scholars and teachers associated with the Marshall Center's Program on Terrorism and Security Studies and edited by Christopher C. Harmon, Andrew N. Pratt, and Sebastian Gorka. This is a requirement for a commercial and academic publisher to produce a book of chapters and documents provided by the Marshall Center. The Marshall Center is seeking a publisher with past experience in marketing, advertising, and sales of similar books. Given the popularity of terrorism studies and related courses in universities and graduate schools, this volume is likely to go into multiple printings.</p>
<p>The contract involves the following phases:<br />3.1.1 Copy-edit and content-edit chapters and documents (CLIN 0001)<br />3.1.2 Provide preliminary galley proofs (CLIN 0002)<br />3.1.3 Incorporate Marshall Center corrections and changes and provide pre-printing galley proofs (CLIN 0003)<br />3.1.4 Deliver 500 copies of the final published book to the Marshall Center (CLIN 0004)</p>
<p>Past experience has shown that it's imperative that the editing function be performed by a native speaker of English with a graduate degree from an accredited university in an English-speaking country in a field closely related to international relations and international security. The Marshall Center has encountered unacceptable products from editors that do not possess these qualifications.</p>
<p>For this particular effort, the Government is not accepting quotes from non-U.S. vendors, a contract award will be made to only a U.S. vendor, and 100% of the requirement must be performed by a U.S. vendor.</p>
<p>The Government desires a publisher with a solid record of publishing books selected for use in graduate programs, favorable reviewed by respected journals and found in reputable commercial venues.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is 1 September 2009 through 10 June 2010. This acquisition will use a trade-off analysis to make a best value award decision. The Government will extend one offer resulting from this request for quote to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the request for quote will be most advantageous to the Government. Quotes will be evaluated based on the stated evaluation factors. The anticipated factors are: Corporate Past Performance and Price.</p>
<p>All prospective contractors must be registered in Dun and Bradstreet (D&amp;B) and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Foreign companies or individuals must first obtain a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) CAGE (NCAGE) code at http://www.ccr.gov/International.aspx. Additionally, contractors currently registered in CCR must update their registration annually. To register or update your company's D&amp;B and CCR record, go to: http://www.ccr.gov/.</p>
<p>The request for quote will be released on or about 29 July 2009, with a closing date on or about 7 August 2009. A copy of the request for quote will be available via e-mail request to Lisa Murphy at <a href="mailto:murphyl@marshallcenter.org">murphyl@marshallcenter.org</a>.</p>

<DESC>Candidates must be U.S. citizens

The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance is recruiting individuals to serve as resident advisors to support its ongoing efforts in Afghanistan and intermittent advisors to work on an engagement in Pakistan.  Advisors are hired under personal services contracts to work for the Banking and Financial Services Program.

The Banking and Financial Services Program is charged with promoting commercial banking sector development that efficiently intermediates between savers and investors. To achieve this, the program works with central banks, ministries of finance, banking regulatory and supervision agencies, deposit insurance agencies, banking associations, and other banking related entities in countries with emerging or transition economies. It also provides technical assistance to countries that have developed economies but are experiencing difficulties in their banking sectors.

In Afghanistan, the advisors are engaged in supporting capacity building efforts at Da Afghanistan Bank (the central bank), the restructuring of state-owned banks, and policy level assistance to the DAB.  In Pakistan, efforts revolve around assisting the State Bank of Pakistan to further implement risk-based banking supervision.

QUALIFICATIONS: Treasury is seeking candidates who possess expertise in banking and bank regulation with specific experience in the restructuring and privatization of banks; banking sector development, banking supervision (on-site and off-site); central bank operations; monetary policy; and other facets of banking sector activity. Ideal candidates would have experience with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, Resolution Trust Corporation, and/or international financial institutions. Prior overseas experience working in challenging environments would be a distinct advantage but is not mandatory. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of officials in host countries is also very important.
 
SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries will be negotiated in accordance with program regulations based on demonstrated salary history. Expected compensation currently ranges from $120,830 to $162,900. Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations. Successful applicants must be able to obtain medical and security clearances. This announcement is open and continuous until December 31, 2009, although selections may be made in advance of that date. To apply, please send cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: recruitment@ota.treas.gov  or by mail to: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N.W. – 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.

Please reference Solicitation Number A09-081 on your resume or OF-612. Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted. No Phone calls please. If you wish to be considered for this announcement and all future announcements for the Financial Institutions Policy and Regulation Program, you must state so in the cover letter to your application. For application materials, visit our web site at: www.treasuryota.us  and www.fedbizopps.gov (search by solicitation number A09-081). The OF-612 form can also be found at www.opm.gov

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Justification and Approval on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of HP BladeSystem equipment. This is a new addition or new contract to expand the existing HP server infrastructure. The IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure is the core infrastructure used to provide ESOC services. The IT Virtual Infrastructure provides virtual servers to host customer systems, allowing the ESOC to consolidate customer systems from stand-alone servers into an efficient, highly available, centrally managed infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure also provides virtual servers used internally to host the ESOC infrastructure services (e.g. Active Directory, DHCP, backup, availability monitoring configuration management. As part of the Data Center Consolidation effort, the ESOC is modernizing the IT Virtual Infrastructure onto a higher density blade server environment. This High Density Computing environment is the modern data center platform approach for IT to meet the continuously growing business demands for faster and more powerful servers, services, and applications. High density computing includes the hardware with vast processing power in a small physical footprint. By consolidating numerous less powerful servers into a high-density solution, IRM can provide the increasing demand for services while also lowering Total Cost of Ownership. HP servers have long served as the ESOC core infrastructure. The current purchase is an extension of the existing infrastructure and is required to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer light-out ESOCs. This is in full compliance with our FISMA reporting responsibilities and the Presidents Management Agenda. 41USC 253(c )(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirement as a key component of the Departments IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. This purchase is an extension of the investment already made in this brand name. this is not a completely new installation but builds upon existing infrastructure.<BR><BR>52.203-15 Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009) (http://www.recovery.gov) 52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009) 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items (Apr 2009)  (Alternate II  Mar 2009) 52.214-26 Audit and Records-Sealed Bidding (Mar 2009)<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, (DOI/NBC) on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) is issuing this DRAFT Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)  for innovative Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) and Automated Threat Recognition (ATR) Technologies for use by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  Both CBP and TSA have a need to improve technologies currently being deployed for inspecting incoming vehicles, cargo conveyances, and air-cargo shipments.  Current NII technologies employed by CBP and TSA include (1) trace material detection of highly specific molecules using technologies such as canine teams or chemical analysis of surface swipes and 'puffs' of air, and (2) imaging inspection using technologies primarily based on X-ray and gamma-ray systems.  Imaging systems inherently have lower material specificity than molecular detection systems.  This BAA focuses entirely on imaging-based technologies, which allow a detailed inspection of vehicles as well as interiors of large cargo and air shipping containers.  Adversaries may use hidden compartments or other methods of concealment to smuggle contraband across the US border.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide CBP and TSA with improved NII technologies for enhanced screening, examination, and detection of contraband, hidden compartments, materials for weapons of mass destruction/mass effect, and human stowaways.  To achieve this goal these new NII systems will have improved penetration, resolution, contrast sensitivity, and throughput, as well as automated material identification capability.
TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THIS BAA, PLEASE SEND EMAIL TO LISA_A_MATTOCKS@NBC.GOV.  No Phone calls please.
The Government intends to solicit this requirement using FAR Part 15 procedures.    Note that dates related to proposal due dates have been removed as this is only a Draft.  Questions/comments in response to this draft BAA are due to DOI/NBC no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Time, Thursday, August 6, 2009  to: Ms. Lisa Mattocks, Contracting Officer via e-mail: Lisa_A_Mattocks@nbc.gov  No telephone calls please.
DHS S&T will be hosting an Industry Day on August 12, 2009 in the Washington D.C. area in order to respond to questions/comments regarding this draft BAA.  All interested bidders are encouraged to attend this meeting.  Registration is required in advance by contacting Ms. Lisa Mattocks, Contracting Officer via e-mail: Lisa_A_Mattocks@nbc.gov  No telephone calls please.  Please include company name, email, and list of attendees.  Further information regarding location will follow registration confirmation.

<DESC>Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action /Sources Sought Announcement /Sole Source Notice
The NPS anticipates soliciting a proposal from a single source, Gallatin County Montana for composting services; however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the NPS. The NPS anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 08/05/09 and awarding a contract in October, 2009. Copies of the solicitation may be obtained by submitting a request to andy_fox@nps.gov or fax 307-344-2079 by 08/05/09.
A)	Statement of Work:   The contract will include composting of YNP municipal solid waste and manure. The NPS has determined that due to transportation costs and environmental issues the composting facility should be located no more than 150 miles (one-way distance) from YNP's headquarters in Mammoth Hot Springs, WY.. The contract will not include the handling or transport of any hazardous materials. YNP personnel will transport the waste to the compost facility, year round, in 75 yard compactor trailers as well as collection trucks directly without using compactor trailers. The number of loads will vary, depending on the time of the year. During the summer months, up to 36 tons per day will be delivered. During the winter months, one 18 ton load will be delivered every seven to ten days. The contractor shall sort the municipal solid waste at the compost facility, separating compostable waste from non-compostable waste. Compostable waste is defined as all organic materials that meets or exceeds the specifications set forth by industry standards. The contractor shall process all compostable municipal solid waste with sewage sludge and manure into compost. The contractor shall store the processed compost in a climate controlled environment. The composting process must divert 85%, by weight, of the municipal solid waste from a land fill. The contractor shall dispose of all non-compostable solid waste at a licensed landfill. The contractor shall register their facility with the state and shall adhere to all federal and state solid waste regulations.
B)	Estimated Quantities:     2,500 tons of municipal solid waste and 325 tons of manure
C)	Anticipated Period of Performance:  10/01/09 - 09/30/12
D)	Proposed Contract Type:  Firm fixed price contract with unit pricing.
E)	Sole source justification, evaluation factors or contractor qualifications:The National Park Service has determined that disposal of waste within the park boundaries of Yellowstone National Park is not appropriate and that long distance transporting of the waste is neither practical nor environmentally appropriate. Analysis of the issue revealed that a significant amount of the waste was comprised of paper and food products.  Based upon the make-up of the waste it was determined that composting of the waste just outside of the Park provided the best means by which to address both the environmental and cost issues of disposing of the waste. The composting process would address the environmental issues surrounding waste disposal by diverting the majority of the waste from the landfill and providing a reusable byproduct. And by composting of the waste just outside of the Park's border YNP's waste disposal costs would be reduced due to the transportation costs. Thus, in 2001 the National Park Service (NPS) and several municipalities in southwest Montana began the process of planning, designing and constructing the Gallatin County composting facility in West Yellowstone, a community just outside of YNP's west entrance. In 2008 Congress recognized the significant importance of the Gallatin County composting facility to the operation of Yellowstone National Park and granted the National Park Service (NPS) authority to pay a significant portion of the cost to upgrade the composting facility for the specific purpose of processing and disposal of waste generated within Yellowstone National Park. Congress went on to elaborate on the continued use of the Gallatin County composting facility by the NPS given the capital contribution made by the NPS.

<DESC>The National Park Service seeks a qualified firm to perform feral pig control/eradication efforts at Pinnacles National Monument located in Paicines, CA.
Background-In 1985 Pinnacles National Monument began construction of a perimeter fence to keep out feral pigs.  The fence enclosing 14,500 acres was completed in 2003.  Pig eradication efforts ensued from 2003 to 2006, creating a pig free zone within the enclosure.  In the past decade Pinnacles National Monument acquired additional acres that include biologically rich wetlands, riparian areas and a campground.  An extension of the feral pig fence on high priority areas of this expansion is important to preserve and maintain the health of native ecosystems.  Once the pig exclusionary fence is expanded, protecting approximately 5,000 acres of new lands, pigs within the enclosure will need to be removed.
Work will be performed under the guidelines provided by the Scope of Work/Specifications of the Request for Quotation (RFQ).  Work will be conducted over consecutive months within 1-2 years.  Efforts should be concentrated in the spring-summer months when natural food resources are more limited (March through October).  The most effective method has proven to be a multiple capture trap that allows entire family groups to be caught.  Other methods are outlined in the Scope of Work and must be strictly adhered to in performance of the work.
The RFQ will be issued on or before July 30, 2009 and will close on August 20, 2009.  The RFQ will be available by electronic means only and can be downloaded from either the FedBizOpps site at http://www.fbo.gov or directly from the Department of Interior website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Contractor's are responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date.
This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the contractor must meet all reporting requirements as described in FAR 52.204-11.  The Contractor shall report the required information using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov.
This acquisition is unrestricted.  The National Park Service will accept quotations from firms with at least 3 years of experience performing similar wildlife control projects.

This project involves repairing the degraded dam and dredging the in-stream pond located on Stoney Creek on the National Naval Medical Center facility in Bethesda, MD.  The work includes two bio-retention areas located adjacent to the pond.  A temporary stone access road will be constructed, allowing dump trucks to receive and haul the dredged material to a temporary drying area above the second bio-retention area.  Once the area around the dam is dredged and inspected by the government-designated Engineer, both sides of the dam will be faced with shot-crete.  The upstream wing walls and bottom of the damn will be filled with grout and sealed with compacted clay and grouted rip rap to correct existing seepage problems and replace lost soil.  The culvert between the bio-retention areas will be replaced and the existing path reconstructed.  The rest of the site will be restored to existing conditions and stabilized with natural vegetation.  Performance period is estimated at 500 calendar days from date of award. The North American Classification System Code for this project is 236220. The RFP will be sent to NAVFAC Washington's 8(a) MACC Contractors Grunley/ Goel JW LCC, FEMCO, Inc., Donley-Kirlin JV, and GDI/ Allen & Shariff JV.

<DESC><p>NAICS Code: 813319. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Program Contract Service Center (PCSC) intends to award a sole source purchase order for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances (OPPTS), Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), Field and External Affairs Division (FEAD) under the authority of FAR part 13.501(a) to the National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) for Support Services.
<p>EPA launched the Integrated Pest Management in Affordable Housing Initiative (IPM) in 2003 as a result of a growing demand for information, tools and training to promote effective pest management practices in affordable housing. The IPM is part of a larger national initiative to reduce environmental health hazards in housing called the "Healthy Housing Initiative." The Healthy Housing Initiative is a partnership involving several EPA offices, working to reduce exposures to pests and pesticides; lead-based paint, mold and moisture; and to promote indoor air quality and other housing conditions that promote resident health and well-being. This initiative is also a cross-Agency effort involving, principally, EPA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>
<p>FEAD requires Support Services for a 12-month period of performance on a fixed price basis with limited time and materials.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W912HY05D00010086.<br><br>RECOVERY-THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  Work to be performed is the establishment of approximately 750 acres of intertidal marsh in Lower Galveston Bay.  This work will occur in an area created using the sediments excavated during widening and deepening of the Houston Ship Channel.  This work is part of a plan to create over 4,000 acres of marsh in the Bay, and will help to restore marsh lost over the years from human activities, and natural processes such as erosion and subsidence.  The created marsh will provide habitat for native fish and wildlife species that are economically and recreationally important to Galveston Bay, and will accommodate public recreation and education.<BR><BR>The work will be accomplished by transplanting sprigs of marsh vegetation at specified intervals.  The sprigs will then spread and vegetate the area.<BR>

<CONTACT>Bonnie S Kennedy, Team Leader, Phone 770-488-2622, Fax 770-488-2671, Email fyq8@cdc.gov - 
<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) designated small businesses to include in a pool of potential Contractors to provide complete Warehouse/Transshipping Management Services (WMS) in owned and leased facilities at three primary locations operated by CDC, and provide materiel distribution to and pick-up from five additional CDC-leased and owned facility areas. The potential small business Contractors should include any current special socioeconomic designations such as SBA certified 8(a) firm, SBA certified Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOB), SBA certified HUBZONE firm, and Women Owned Business (WOB). The CDC, in consultation with representatives from the SBA, may determine that any future solicitations be set-aside for specific socioeconomic groups. Small businesses should also indicate if they are currently GSA federal supply schedule holders for SIN 874501, 874503, or 874504.</p>
<p>The WMS locations include the CDC Roybal campus at Clifton Road, Chamblee Campus, and the Peachtree Distribution Center (PDC) in Chamblee - all within the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Each location may have unique requirements deviating from the general requirements, standards, and workload. The primary services are Receiving, Distribution, Pick-up and Delivery of Excess Property, Short-term Storage, Expedited Materiel Handling, Bulk shipping, and Select Agent Support. The Contractor shall perform quality control and achieve all performance work statement (PWS) requirements within the specified workload and standards. The Contractor shall standardize best practices across all locations to the extent practicable to provide for consistency in performance. The Contractor shall be the point of contact for all CDC occupants and other parties concerning Warehouse Services as well as other services needed to be able to direct customers to the right person for services such as distribution and storage requirements. The government will perform quality assurance to ensure the CDC community receives the optimal level of services as defined in the Government Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan (QASP). The primary role of the government will be in exercising inspection and acceptance of services.</p>
<p>Major objectives that will be measured include:</p>
<p>1. Warehousing and distribution channel management to enhance efficiencies and customer value. Receiving is the function of processing incoming property, equipment, and merchandise against purchase orders, visa invoices, and customer return authorizations. The process includes verification of proper item, quantity, and physical condition. The function also includes the physical inspection of an item, identification, bar-coding, staging for delivery to its final destination, and preparation of receiving reports. Distribution is the process of delivering materiel, equipment, property, and merchandise to our customers throughout the Atlanta facilities. The distribution process shall include the pick up of returns of supplies (merchandise) from CIOs that must be returned to the vendor.</p>
<p>2. Planning, implementing, and controlling the flow, storage, and distribution of property to the end-user location to meet customers' requirements.</p>
<p>3. Responding to customer demands and inquiries by providing prompt and courteous customer support. Customer service is the set of actions that we must take during and after the main functional services have been provided. It is the way we respond to our CDC customers' needs and concerns while delivering the set of services we provide. Customer service includes phone and email etiquette, and all face-to-face encounters. The Contractor must respond to all customer inquiries (made by phone, or email), within one (1) business day of receipt. If additional research is required to respond to customers' inquiries, then the Contractor shall contact the customer to provide a status. All Contractor employees must display a courteous and friendly behavior while performing all required functions of the PWS (including over the phone).</p>
<p>4. Storing and distributing incoming freight of many different commodities including hazardous and Select Agent materials support. Select Agent materiel support refers to the process of handling, safeguarding, and moving of agents and toxins that USDA and/or HHS considers having potential to pose substantial harm to human health or agriculture. The Contractor shall have all staff working at the Roybal Transshipping Facility Select Agent-certified at all times. The Select Agent training and certification is provided by the Government at no cost to the Contractor. All Contractor employees must pass an extremely rigid background check. Additionally, Contractor employees must pass and maintain a Department of Justice Clearance for handling Select Agents. The training, background check, and the Department of Justice clearance is provided to the Contractor at no extra cost. The Contractor Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager will be required to be Select Agent approved for management coverage at the Roybal Transshipping Facility.</p>
<p>5. Preparing outbound freight.</p>
<p>6. Receiving, monitoring, temporarily storing property until delivery can be made to its final destination and providing warehouse maintenance. Warehouse maintenance refers to the process of evaluating, planning, and coordinating the available space in a manner that maximizes the use of warehouse floor space. Warehouse maintenance includes the staging of property from the time it arrives to the point at which it is either stored, and/or delivered. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining the warehouse in a manner that separates all processes; incoming/outgoing excess property, property pending disposal, personal property, receiving (incoming property), outgoing property (to CIOs), outgoing shipments, and sensitive items. The Contractor shall maintain an electronic Warehouse Management System (WMS) and Locator System that identifies all real-time "contents" of all space (including open space) and racks within the warehouse. The Contractor shall prepare a Plano graph (floor plan) of the locator system and obtain approval from the General Supply Specialist (GSS) or the designated Government official. After the Government's approval the Contractor shall post the Plano graph in the receiving area, the warehouse entrances, the excess areas, and throughout the warehouse. The Contractor shall obtain approval from the GSS or the designated Government office prior to making any changes to the Locator System. The Contractor shall also provide real-time internal tracking system for all packages/equipment from receipt to delivery.</p>
<p>7. The Contractor shall provide the full range of services listed above to all CDC metropolitan Atlanta locations listed below. All locations must receive the same level of service and commitment. Additionally, as CDC grows and reorganizes, new offices and buildings may require services. The Contracting Officer may add service locations within the Metro Atlanta area as needed.</p>
<p>CDC METRO ATLANTA CAMPUS LOCATIONS:</p>
<p>Roybal Campus <br />1600 Clifton Road <br />Atlanta, GA 30333</p>
<p>Century Center<br />Century Boulevard<br />Atlanta, GA 30345</p>

This is a performance-based acquisition that describes the required outputs and outcomes.

<DESC>Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its law enforcement components (i.e., U. S. Border Patrol, Office of Field Operation, and CBP Air and Marine) by the nature of their operations and facility locations have a need to off-set its water consumption within the San Pedro Watershed.  CBP has calculated its overall water mitigation requirements to be between 140 acre-feet and 225 acre-feet per year.  It is preferable that the mitigation would be a one-time occurrence for the required amount of the first mitigation effort.  CBP will have to meet with US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on an annual basis to determine any changes in mitigation requirements.  The mitigation must be located within the Sierra Vista Subwatershed.  It is preferred that the proposed mitigation be located close to the International Border between the United States and the Republic of Mexico within the Subwatershed to better offset consumption.  USFWS must be able to be approved any proposed mitigation for the mitigation to be acceptable to CBP.   CBP is looking to potentially acquire the proposed mitigation next fiscal year (FY 2010) or earlier, if possible.  Any offeror that believes they have a product(s) that can meet the above may submit information by e-mail (only) to Rick Travis at richard.travis@dhs.gov not later than 10 August 2009. The information must be sufficient to determine that the offeror’s capabilities to produce the above noted equipment. This synopsis is intended for information and planning purposes only and the government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted. Based upon responses received, the government reserves to determine the format for solicitation.

<SUBJECT>R&D Project to Improve the Prototype High Surface Area Solid Phase Microextraction (HSA-SPME) Device 
<SOLNBR>LDQ001986
<RESPDATE>080309
<CONTACT>Lynda M. Theisen, Fax 703-632-8480, Email Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov
<DESC><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation issues this sources sought notice to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) capable of performing a study on the flow dynamics necessary to enhance volatile organic chemical (VoC) uptake under high flow conditions in a chip-based design.
<p><strong>1. BACKGROUND <br /></strong>Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME) has been widely exploited for trace-level chemical sampling both in the gas and liquid phase. Recently, a high surface area SPME (HSA-SPME) operating at a high flow rate of 3.6 L min" and with a sampling time of a few seconds has beeh developed for efficient uptake of volatile organic compounds (VoCs). Improvements in collection efficiency relative to conventional SPME have been obtained that result in final detection limits for VOCs that are two orders of magnitude lower (0.2-6.9 pptrc) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as an analyzer. However, further improvement is still required to achieve performance comparable to that of canines. This project will proceed to conduct R&amp;D activities to optimize the current HSA-SPME design to further improve the detection sensitivity at high flow rates. The work will cover understanding the current technical hurdles that inhibit the sampler from achieving the desired collection and desorption efficiency, as well as redesigning and testing it based on the findings. The technical achievements from this project are expected to lay a strong foundation for the design and implementation of a light-weight and pocket-size portable VOC sampler based on chip technology.</p>
<p><strong>2. PROJECT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES <br /></strong>The goal of this research project is to improve the prototype high surface area solid phase microextraction (HSA-SPME) device by studying the flow dynamics necessary to enhance volatile organic chemical (VoC) uptake under high flow conditions in a chip-based design. <br />The specific objectives of this research project are to:</p>
<p>&bull; model and optimize the air flow dynamics within the current HSA-SPME device, <br />&bull; increase the surface area while keeping the current geometry fixed to enhance the VOC uptake, <br />&bull; enhance affinity of specific analytes using arrays with different polarities, and<br />&bull; deliver an advanced prototype for further testing and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>3. TECHNICAL APPROACH</strong> <br />The final detection limit is determined by collection and desorption efficiencies of the sampler which are favored by a high mass transfer rate. The latter is primarily determined by the following factors:</p>
<p>&bull; airflow dynamics inside the sampler; <br />&bull; the boundary layer above the collection surface; <br />&bull; the collection surface area; <br />&bull; the collection surface affinity to the target analytes; <br />&bull; and, the heating efficiency for desorption. <br />Among these factors, it is well understood that a higher collection surface area will favor good collection efficiency, and that raising the temperature up to a certain level tends to increase the desorption efficiency. For conventional SPME, airflow dynamics inside the sampler affect the effective thickness of the boundary layer and the relationship is well understood. However, this relationship is not self-evident for the HSA-SPME since the airflow dynamics vary with the orientation of the collection surface in the air stream. This needs to be optimized to achieve desirable performance. Surface affinity is a critical parameter for absorption/desorption, and may also be exploited for separating VOCs based on polar preferences. This project will focus on the optimization of air flow dynamics inside the sampler and the collection surface affinity, as well as enhancement of the collection surface area.</p>
<p><strong>4. AIR FLOW DYNAMICS MODELING AND SIMULATION <br /></strong>First, modeling of the airflow velocity, direction, and profile based on the current design will be desired to understand the impact of these parameters on the boundary layer. As a consequence, the relationship between these parameters and collection efficiency will be determined. The findings will guide the modification of airflow parameters and hardware design for optimization. Second, the collection efficiency of coil collector wiring will be compared with that of linear collector wiring. For the former, the boundary layers at different parts of the surface are expected to vary due to the difference in local airflow velocity and direction. Only a part of the surface (highlighted in yellow) is subject to the pressure created by the airflow, there is uncertainty as to whether enough pressure is created on the other part of the exposed surface (highlighted in dark) to ensure a good collection. It will be important in this phase of the project to test how the airflow will impact the boundary layer for the coil wiring orientation and it may not be as simple as that for the straight linear orientation. To investigate this it is desired that numerical simulations of airflow dynamics using the Mechanical Computer Aided Design (MCAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics Design (CFD-design) software packages. If any modification of the current coil wiring design is necessary, an alternate design, such as straight linear wiring will be modeled and validated. In addition, altering airflow direction during sampling will be considered for the coil wiring design to eliminate the surface area with low collection efficiency, and simulations will be conducted for comparison.</p>
<p><strong>5. COLLECTION SURFACE AREA ENHANCEMENT</strong> <br />The findings from the airflow dynamics simulation hopefully will suggest a more efficient utilization of the collection surface, and hence increased collection efficiency. An alternate approach that will be investigated is to construct the surface with a porous structure. A porous structured surface typically has an exposed area that is several times larger than that of a non-porous surface. However, if the pore size is too small, desorption may not be favored. Therefore, the pore size range should be optimized to obtain the best trade-off between absorption and desorption efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>6. COLLECTION SURFACE AFFINITY TO THE ANALYTES </strong></p>
<p>It has been shown that polymer coatings with different affinity properties affect the extraction time, equilibration time, and partition coefficients. A variety of surfaces coated with polymers with different polarities can be prepared to collect VOCs with different polarities. For identification all collected VOCs are currently transferred to a trap at the same time and the mixture is then injected into a GC-MS for analysis. The drawback of this sample transfer method is that the selectivity originally provided by the different polar surfaces is completely eliminated. Combining samples may increase certain interference effects for the subsequent analyte identification process. An alternate sample transfer process may provide an analyte sorting mechanism prior to analysis for the purpose of reducing interference effects, and thus increasing detection sensitivity. An array of sample collectors targeting analytes with various polarities will release the samples in sequential order to a GC-MS, or a focusing trap followed by a GC-MS, for identification. Since different surfaces have different partition coefficients for VOCs with various polarities, the absorption of a particular coating will provide some selectivity. As a consequence, the non-target VOCs may be partially separated from target ones, and their interference effect will be reduced. Therefore the detection sensitivity could be enhanced. Additionally, by combining GC data generated with separated groups of VOCs, a 2-D spectrum will be obtained that contains richer information for target detection <br />confirmation and signature analysis.</p>
<p><strong>7.0 RESEARCH PLAN</strong></p>
<p>In Phase I, the work will focus on performing airflow dynamics modeling to understand how the airflow dynamics parameters influence the collection efficiency. Also the effect of collector wiring orientation (coil vs. straight) on the collection efficiency will be evaluated. The design will be modified and MCAD/CFD simulations will be performed as needed. Any updates in implementation will be validated via in-house testing. Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes (BTEX) will be used as target VOCs for in-house testing, and a GC-MS will be utilized for identification. <br />The Phase I work can be expanded if time and funding is available to explore the feasibility of implementing a porous-structured surface for sample collection. In addition, a variety of commercially available SPME coatings will be identified to fabricate an array of collectors with different polarities. In-house testing will be carried out to evaluate the sorting capability for the analytes. Protocols for sequential desorption and identification will be developed. In the meantime, data analysis will be carried out to interpret the resultant 2D GC spectrum. Also, in Phase I if time and funding is available, field testing will be conducted to validate any new designs.</p>

<DESC>Recovery - New Gateway Visitor Center & Headquarters
"THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S MATOC CONTRACT NUMBER 401818D504."
RECOVERY-The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contemplates entering into negotiations with one of our MATOC Design-Build contractors and to award a Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Order for the design and construction of a new visitor center and administrative offices facility for the Coastal NC National Wildlife Refuges to be located at their headquarters site on Roanoke Island, NC.  NAICS CODE 541310, Size Standard: $4.5 Million. TAS::14 2911::TAS.  The Project Number is 97110122.  The magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  POC for this requirement is Walter D. Cowan, CCITE Contract Specialist, at (404) 679-4068.
The Coastal NC NWRS Gateway Visitor Center and Headquarters facility will be approximately 17,840 SF and will be constructed on the north end of Roanoke Island, NC on a 35 acre parcel the Service purchased for this purpose.   Due to the location, there is an extremely high potential for visitation.  As a result, the expectation is that the new facility will serve as a "gateway" visitor center for all of the coastal North Carolina refuges and thus increase the visibility of and visitation to each of them.
The new facility will be designed and constructed around the Service's standard large 2-Story Administration/Visitor Center plan.  The modified plan will be further refined during the design phase. 
The Visitor Center will include a book store, exhibit space, an environmental education classroom, a multi-purpose room and exterior interpretive facilities. The Headquarters offices will be shared by approximately 30 Service employees. These personnel serve several Service programs including Alligator NWR, Pea Island NWR, Law Enforcement, Prescribed Fire, and the Ecological Services Red Wolf Recovery Team.  The facility will allow the Service to vacate existing GSA leased space which will save over $120,000 annually.
The facility will be LEED certified to the highest level practicable and will include water-saving elements i.e. rainwater harvesting, low-flow fixtures and grey water reuse.  The facility will be very energy efficient and will reduce, by a minimum of 30%, the average energy costs of a building of its size.  In addition, our goal is for at least 40% of the facilities energy needs to come from renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR URGENCY IN SHADE CARD MAINTENANCE


The forest planted and shade carded 394 acres of the Black Butte fire on the Salmon River Ranger District.  The forest service went back into the site to install the stake rows and discovered that a large number of the shade cards were pulled out of the ground.  The crew was unable to determine the cause of the stakes being pulled out.  Some of the shade cards were broken off.

The forest planted 534 acres on the Black Butte fire spring of 2009.  The planting is located on the breaks of the Salmon River.  Of the 534 acres 394 acres were in burned over plantations that the wild fire completely destroyed.    The seedlings were planted at a 9 x 9 spacing.  It left no micro site material on these acres.  The elevation of these acres is 3400 ft to 5000 ft.  These acres are on steep slopes ranging from 05-70 percent slope.  The canyon summer temperatures can reach in the mid 100’s.  

The forest service shade carded the 394 acres due to no existing micro-siting.  The cost of the seedling were $44,000.00.  The price to plant the seedlings was another $69,000.00, and to install the shade cards was $57,000.00.  The forest has a $170,000.00 invested in the seedlings.  

It is critical for the survival of the seedling to do maintenance of the shade cards on the 394 acres immediately as we are into July and the daytime temps are reaching the 100 degree mark on those sites.

Under the urgent and compelling circumstances of this need, the forest obtained 3 bids from local contractors.  Award was made to 5 Star Forestry LLC on July 27, 2009 for $27,580.00 for shade card replacement and maintenance of 394 acres in the Black Butte fire area.

<DESC>BACKGROUND:
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing and fielding an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air and space-based assets to defend the United States, Friends and Allies, and Deployed Forces from ballistic missile attack.  The BMDS program is composed of a number of elements and programs with numerous contracts and prime contractors that must be integrated to create one unified system.  The MDA program uses a capability-based spiral development approach that uses key knowledge points for Block development and fielding.  The MDA leadership requires integrated decision support capability at both the MDA Integration Synchronization Group (ISG) and the Program Change Board (PCB).  These capabilities must visualize the decision trade space including MDA goals, priorities, and element/functional baseline interdependencies. The MDA leadership requires a collaborative decision support environment for complex MDA decisions and a more “virtual” collaborative environment across different geographic regions for straight forward decisions.

The Decision Support System is a complex system comprised of people, business processes, workflows, system automation, and decision models, with governance and standards to support MDA leadership in synchronizing and integrating the BMDS Baselines (Resource, Schedule, Technical, Contracts, Test, and Operations) for rapid development of decision options and trade-offs for program cost, schedule, and performance.

Contract Award – 2nd Quarter FY 2010
Start Performance – 1 April 2010

OCI CONSIDERATIONS:
The acquisition of the Decision Support System services under the forthcoming solicitation may create actual or potential conflicts of interest (OCIs) for offerors and their prospective subcontractors or other team members.  In assessing and addressing conflicts of interest, MDA will follow the guidance in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Offerors will be responsible for ensuring that they and their proposed subcontractors or other team members are not restricted from participating in the forthcoming Request for Proposal due to an OCI related to any MDA-funded contract or subcontract; Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) development, fielding or sustainment related contracts or subcontracts; or other significant, non-BMDS related business relationships with firms doing business with, or in support of, the MDA. 

It is MDA’s policy that, consistent with GAO and court decisions, impaired objectivity (bias-type) OCI’s cannot be adequately mitigated through firewalls and/or separate corporate divisions.  An impaired objectivity OCI is not mitigated if a contractor performs BMDS development, fielding or sustainment efforts and a firewalled affiliate and/or separate organizational component provides separate Decision Support System services. 
For purposes of this competition, therefore, MDA does not intend to award any contracts to any contractors, subcontractors, or other team members who also participate in the development, fielding or sustainment of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Also, MDA does not intend to grant OCI waivers of bias-type (i.e., biased ground rules and impaired objectivity) as part of this procurement process. 
The solicitation will provide further information relating to impaired objectivity and other OCIs and how to have them addressed and preliminarily resolved prior to offer submission. Additionally, the solicitation will include a clause(s) in Section H that will establish restrictions and obligations to avoid, neutralize or mitigate OCIs.

<DESC>Notice Number: NOT-CA-09-031
Key Dates
Release Date: July 20, 2009
Response Date:  Responses must be received by August 24, 2009
Issued by
National Cancer Institute (NCI), (http://www.cancer.gov)
This is a Request for Information (RFI).  It is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation for grants, contracts, etc. 
Purpose and Objectives

This RFI is to gather information from the scientific community regarding opportunities in cancer immunotherapy and immunoprevention that would benefit from accelerated development through focused funding and coordinated management. This request is part of the NCI’s new Process to Accelerate Translational Science as recommended by the Translational Research Working Group (TRWG). At the discretion of the NCI, the information gathered in response to this RFI may be used in a variety of ways by the NCI, including but not limited to:  1) assist NCI in the development of Requests for Proposals (RFP), Requests for Applications (RFA), Program Announcements (PA), Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA), Cooperative Agreements and/or other mechanisms/agreements; 2) assist in developing formulations, production and implementation of products/devices/processes using existing internal NCI mechanisms, to include but not limited to in-house staff, contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, etc.; or 3) no action taken. 
Background

The TRWG was an NCI-sponsored working group charged with evaluating the status of the NCI’s investment in translational research and envisioning its future in an inclusive, representative, and transparent manner.  In 2007, the NCI accepted the 15 TRWG recommendations to accelerate translational cancer research as outlined in the report entitled “Transforming Translation: Harnessing Discovery for Patient and Public Benefit,” (http://www.cancer.gov/trwg). 
One of the TRWG recommendations was the establishment of a yearly process to identify a small number of opportunities for specific cancer treatment, prevention or assessment modalities that are “ripe” for further development, and then to provide the funding or resources as well as the project management required to advance these opportunities as rapidly as possible to early stage clinical trials.  This recommendation is being implemented and includes a prioritization process to identify and rank individual translational research opportunities, the provision of dedicated project management resources for the resulting prioritized projects, and the development of project specific funding approaches for these new, prioritized Special Translational Research Acceleration Projects (STRAPs). 
The Process to Accelerate Translational Science was initiated with the first NCI Translational Science Meeting, held November 7-9, 2008 (http://ncitranslates.nci.nih.gov).  This meeting educated the translational cancer research community about the TRWG Pathways to Clinical Goals (Clinical Cancer Research 14: 5663-5714, 2008, http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/vol14/issue18/#CCR_SPECIAL_FOCUS) and demonstrated that there are compelling translational research opportunities that warrant acceleration.  The Pathways to Clinical Goals describe the steps required to create a treatment, prevention or assessment modality based on advances in scientific knowledge, and develop that modality to the point of early phase clinical trials.  The term “Translational Research Opportunity” refers to a developmental project that follows one of these six TRWG Pathways (Agent, Immune Response Modifier, Interventive Device, or Lifestyle Alteration intervention, or  Biospecimen-Based or Imaging-Based Assessment tool), and identifies the population/cancer type in which it is to be tested. 
Information Requested 

This RFI invites input from the scientific community on Translational Research Opportunities that follow the Immune Response Modifiers Pathway to testing in Phase I/II clinical trials (Clinical Cancer Research 14: 5692-5699, 2008, http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/18/5692.pdf).  Information is sought from members of the scientific community at large, academic and non-academic translational cancer researchers, clinical oncologists, and investigators from the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry.  The opportunities can relate to a range of specific therapeutic regimens and target populations.  Any information that can be shared regarding the immunogenicity and therapeutic function of an antigen, the scientific validity and feasibility of the formulation for that antigen, and/or the scientific validity and feasibility of combinations with immune modifier agents is requested.  In addition, information on assays of immune response, assays for patient selection, and the availability of patients for clinical trials, is requested. The Translational Research Opportunity Template (see below) provides the preferred submission format.  Use of this format is requested; however, respondents are not required to use this format for their submission. 
This RFI is for planning purposes and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or as an obligation on the part of the Government to provide support for any opportunities identified in response to it.  Please note that the United States Government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for its use of that information. 
Information Submission Instructions 
1.	Respondents are encouraged to utilize the Translational Research Opportunity Template to organize their responses.  The template can be found at http://patsinitiative.nci.nih.gov. 
2.	Responses should be limited to twenty (20) pages in length.  Brief and/or bullet information are encouraged wherever applicable in order to minimize overall response length and aid in the data processing. 
3.	It is preferred that responses be submitted in MS Word or PDF format via e-mail to NCI-RFI-IRMPathway@mail.nih.gov marked with the above RFI identifier (Notice Number) noted in the subject line. Respondents will receive an email confirmation acknowledging receipt of their response, but will not receive individualized feedback. 
4.	Responses will only be accepted through August 24, 2009. 
Confidentiality 

Responses to this RFI are voluntary and may be anonymous.  Any identifiers (e.g. names, institutions, e-mail addresses, etc.) will be removed when responses are compiled.  Anonymized results may be shared with scientific advisors convened by the NCI under confidentiality and conflict of interest agreements.  No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response.  The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).  As previously indicated, NCI can use the information gathered to develop grant, contract, or other funding initiatives.

<DESC><p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Capital Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Biomark, Inc. using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13, to purchase 26 passive integrated transponder (PIT) readers to read PIT tags carried by wild, threatened and endangered, sea turtles. NMFS and our partners have expended significant time and public funding to capture and tag endangered and threatened sea turtles. The most permanent tags in use are implanted PIT tags, which must be read and decoded with a PIT tag reader. Without the reader you cannot read the tag or identify the animal by its PIT tag. Detailed information on the identity of individual endangered and threatend turltes is needed to monitor and assess the status and trends of these listed species. Data on growth, movements, survivorship, and fecundity are critical to assessing population status. These data cannot be obtained without being able to identify individual animals over time, through the use of internally implanted PIT tags, which can only be located and decoded with the PIT tag readers this procurement seeks to buy. This information will assist NMFS and the public in gathering better information on the status of listed sea turtles. Biomark, Inc. is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the quote meets all of the foregoing requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Gina.E.Lee@noaa.gov or faxed to (301) 713-0808 by August 3, 2009. Award will be made using FAR 13, Simplified acquisition procedures, current through FAC 2005-35. The determination to compete or not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Capital Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Team intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Southern Illinois University at Carbondale using the procedures in FAR Parts 6 and 13, to study the current-use insecticides as a limiting factor for coho salmon conservation and recovery in urban streams. The goal of this proposed study is to conduct sediment sampling in two representative Seattle creeks that provide spawning and rearing habitat for coho salmon. The aim is to determine if pyrethroids are present in the creeks and if they are at concentrations toxic to sensitive benthic invertebrates. The findings from this investigation will determine whether their rapidly growing residential use is a threat to the benthic communities that support coho and other salmonids in Puget Sound and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Michael Lydy (SIUC) will receive sediment samples (approximately 17 anticipated) from Dr. Donald Weston (UC Berkeley) from two Seattle creeks. He will analyze the sediments for eight pyrethroid insecticides including cis- and trans- permethrin, cyfluthrin I,II,III and IV, cypermethrin I,II,III and IV, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin. Analysis will be performed on an Agilent 6890 series gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an Agilent 7683 autosampler and an electron capture detector (ECD) (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Two columns, a HP-5MS (30m x 0.25mm; 0.25&#61549;m film thickness) and a DB-608 (30m x 0.25mm; 0.25&#61549;m film thickness) will be used for analytical results confirmation. Calibration will be based on area using five external standards in the range of 2.5-250 &micro;g/L of each of pesticide and surrogate in hexane. Qualitative identity will be established using a retention window of 1% with confirmation on a second column. In addition, Dr. Lydy will test a subset of the toxic sediments (initial toxicity will be determined by Dr. Weston using Hyalella azteca) using a 10-d Chironomus dilutus assay with survival as the endpoint. A maximum of five C. dilutus tests will be conducted. Southern Illinois University at Carbondale is the only party known to NOAA who can meet these requirements. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source.

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity whose dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI uses workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a publically available web portal (http://devenci.dtic.mil/) to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It provides timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses. Instead, it focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed adoption of emerging technology solutions to DoD user needs.
Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before August 7, 2009. Selected companies will be responsible for their travel and all other expenses associated with participation in this workshop which will be held in the October timeframe.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent. The Midwest Area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to TA Instruments – Waters LLC, 109 Lukens Drive, New Castle, DE 19720. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the Food and Industrial Oil Research Unit, NCAUR, MWA, ARS, USDA at Peoria, IL for a Q2000 Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter with Autosampler and Mass Flow Control available only through TA Instruments. This is a proprietary product of TA Instrument and contains patented technology which is needed to meet their scientific research needs. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with TA Instruments without further notice.  This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. 

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

JUSTIFICATION

1. Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)). 
USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, Midwest Area, Procurement & Property Section

2. Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).
	a. This contracting action is to obtain a Q2000 modulated differential scanning calorimeter with accessories.  

3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).
	The equipment required is a Q2000 Modulated differential scanning calorimeter. The DSC has an autosampler so that multiple samples can be loaded for analysis at one time and so that the user can perform experiments (each lasting >30 minutes/sample) automatically and collect data over the nights and weekends.  Our analyses require temperature ranges from -90ºC to 180ºC by the use of a refrigerated cooling system.  Our experiments require high sensitivity as well as precision and reproducibility. According to our market research, the Q2000 offers the best reproducibility (0.05%), precision (0.05%), sensitivity: (0.2 &#956;W), and height/width ratio (mW/C using Nitrogen atmosphere) of >60.  This instrument has patented modulated temperature DSC capabilities, which allows for the detection of both reversing and nonreversing heat flow for better sensitivity to weak transitions, and more accurate measurement of crystallinity.  Also required is the patented Tzero technology, which provides very flat baselines and therefore high resolution and sensitivity.  Accessories include a scale that will measure with 0.01 to 0.1 mg reproducibility, a press and die set, a pressure regulator, refrigerated cooling system, a gas dryer, installation and training. The Government’s estimated cost is $60,000. 

4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).
	10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. 

5. Demonstration of Contractor’s Unique Qualifications (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5)).
     a. Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2))  
 	(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) states, 
	“When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.” 
	(2) The named vendor is the producer of proprietary and patented technology available only through this company.  

6. Federal Business Opportunities – FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6).
a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required equipment that can produce the same results.
b. USDA/ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government.

7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7).
	After a thorough web search, no other suppliers were located that could supply equipment with the sensitivity needed for the research being performed.  Two other companies had similiar instruments that could not provide the sensitivity needed and were at a higher cost.

8. Description of Market Research (FAR6.303-2 (a)(8).
	The market research that was performed showed no alternate sources at this time that could meet the scientific research needs and provide the sensitivity needed.
 
9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))
	Due to the proprietary nature of the item needed to perform the research, at this time there is only one source available.
 
10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10).
	No other sources are available at this time.

11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).
	Vendor surveys are done from time to time to see if other existing items can meet the research requirements.  Scientists have tested other similar products but no similar results can be guaranteed.

12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2b
	I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.

CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION:  (FAR 6.303-1(A), 6.303-2(A)(12)
I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued using simplified acquisition procedures 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporation provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-35.

The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541380.  This procurement will be full and open competition.  

The Food and Drug Administration is seeking contractors to provide service for animal studies on an ongoing project entitled:  Pandemic Flu and Blood Study:  Pilot Studies to Determine Viremia and Potential Transfusion Transmission in H5N1 Infection using Small Animal Model.

Background:

In the past few years, H5N1 strains of avian influenza have been shown to infect poultry in several parts of Asia and a highly pathogenic form for humans emerged in 1997.  Human infections of this virus have been identified since then.  Unlike other influenza viruses, H5N1 exhibits a wide range of unique pathologic features including hypercytokinemia, hemophagocytosis and neurologic involvement in some cases suggesting that pathogenesis and modes of spread of this virus may be different than seasonal flu strains.  The potential for transmission of pandemic flue through blood transfusion and blood products is not known.  H5N1 has been detected in blood of persons acutely infected with H5N1 virus using sensitive PCR methods.  The possibility of a viremic period, before the onset of clinical symptoms and/or after symptom resolution, remains an important concern regarding blood safety.  This knowledge gap in transfusion safety needs to be addressed in order to understand the infectivity of H5N1 in blood.  Results from appropriate animal model studies could provide insights into the viremic period following H5N1 infection using an animal model that could help define a deferral period after exposure to pandemic influenza strains.

Statement of Work:

This is a continuation of a project by the FDA, which included a study with 32 mice and a study with 24 ferrets, each at two dose levels, has been completed.  For the in vitro part, the following samples will be analyzed.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFKPR00-9-14825 is being issued as a Request for Quotation. This acquisition is being solicited using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated NAICS code and business size standard is 611310 and $6.5M. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Endangered Species Division has a requirement to determine whether sediments collected from two Seattle area creeks are toxic to aquatic invertebrates since Coho salmon, a species of concern, could potentially be affected by the reduction in aquatic invertebrates. The goal of this proposed study is to conduct sediment sampling in two representative Seattle creeks that provide spawning and rearing habitat for coho salmon. The aim is to determine if pyrethroids are present in the creeks and if they are at concentrations toxic to sensitive benthic invertebrates. The findings from this investigation will determine whether their rapidly growing residential use is a threat to the benthic communities that support coho and other salmonids in Puget Sound and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest. The contractor shall collect sediment samples (approximately 17 anticipated) from two Seattle creeks. He will test the toxicity of those sediments using a 10-day Hyalella azteca assay with survival as the endpoint. If any sediments cause mortality greater than 50% of that of the control, follow-up testing with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in the overlying water will be done to help establish if pyrethroids were responsible for the toxicity. The number of samples requiring PBO testing will not exceed six, but could be less depending upon the number of the original samples found to be highly toxic, for those samples requiring further toxicity testing with Chironomus dilutes. The contractor shall be responsible for transferring the material to be tested to SIU. The study will follow the proposed schedule below (Table 1). The contractor shall provide a report to NMFS PR that documents the findings of this study. The report will provide a summary, synthesis, and statistical analysis of experimental results that use tables and graphs as appropriate. The report may take the form of a publication suitable for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. Upon request, the contractor shall provide NMFS a spreadsheet of raw data from the toxicity assays. Period of Performance: Date of Award through June 30, 2010. The resulting purchase order shall be firm fixed price. The award shall be made on a best value basis. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Technical Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 2) Past Performance - The relevance and quality of prior performance; and 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. The evaluation shall be based on use of the adjectival scheme as follows: Outstanding (O) - Conspicuously striking in eminence; Good (G) - Beneficial and worthwhile; sound and valid; Adequate (A) - Reasonably sufficient and suitable; Marginal (M) - Minimally suitable at the lower limit.

The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.

STATEMENT OF WORK
July 28, 2009

I.	INTRODUCTION  

The energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors (green jobs) are deemed to be emerging and high growth industries.   Early indicators reflect low participation of women in green training programs.  The purpose of this project is to increase the participation of women in training programs that teach the skills required in any of the seven energy efficiency and renewable energy industries defined in Section 171(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Workforce Investment Act, which include:
•	The energy-efficient building, construction, and retrofit industries;
•	The renewable electric power industry;
•	The energy efficient and advanced drive train vehicle industry;
•	The biofuels industry;
•	The deconstruction and materials use industries;
•	The energy efficiency assessment industry serving residential, commercial, or industrial sectors; and 
•	Manufacturers that produce sustainable products using environmentally sustainable processes and materials.

II. BACKGROUND  

The WB’s mission is to improve the status of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment.  The WB, through its Strengthening the Family Initiatives – Better Jobs, Better Earnings, Better Living and Value-Added Partners – prepares women for tomorrow’s jobs and promotes an environment that is responsive to the demands and challenges of the 21st Century workforce.  Women in the labor force have grown from eight million in 1920 to almost 71 million in 2007.  By the Year 2012, women are projected to comprise 47 percent of the U. S. labor force.  While the current economic downturn has resulted in job losses primarily for men (80 percent as opposed to 20 percent women losing their jobs), in order for women to continue to contribute to the family income and provide for their children as single parents, additional efforts are needed to ensure that women are made aware of opportunities in the emerging and high growth industries.
The Women’s Bureau, Region 10, is soliciting a Contractor to work with the WB Regional office to increase the participation of women in an existing green job training program or expand a current training program for women to incorporate a green jobs component.  The goal for the project is to assist at least 20 women enter training leading to a certification or other industry-recognized skill that will lead to employment.  The targeted area for this project is:  Seattle, WA  and the Portland, OR areas.

•	Must operate a training program that serves women and incorporates a certified skills training program in any of the seven energy efficiency and renewable energy industries as defined above in the Workforce Investment Act.
•	Must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov)

Under this project, Contractor will design an outreach,  recruitment, and retention support model that assists a minimum of 20 women enter training in one or more of their energy efficiency or renewable energy industry training programs that leads to a certification or industry-recognized skill leading to employment.

5.	Provide reports on a quarterly basis to the WB if there are any changes in the number of women enrolled in pertinent green jobs courses, course completions, job placements, best practices as identified and challenges encountered.  Reporting format will be provided by WB.
6.	Before training is completed, identify potential employers and assist participants with job search skills following completion of training.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />FOR <br />INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST SUPPORT
<p style="text-align: center;">27 May 2009</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />1.0 Introduction. The Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO) serves as a focal point for Air Force and Navy exportable and importablemedical and disaster related courses, providing synergy for the development, maintenance, and implementation of training. The ultimate goal of the Institute is to provide training that improves host nations' and our nation's abilities to manage their own threats/crises and to respond as coalition partners in regional crises. The model supports teams of Total Force subject matter experts to "train the trainers" and collectively supports the theater security cooperation plans for the regional commanders and mission performance plans for the host country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Institute provides oversight for the development and implementation of courses that meet national and regional Commanders' objectives. Recent events emphasized the need for an overall strategy for disaster preparedness at home and throughout the world. The training implemented by the Institute provides an excellent opportunity to augment this strategy through multilateral engagement-building international medical bridges through collective approaches to public health, disease prevention and response to man-made and natural disasters. The U. S. International affairs goals include improving the global health environment and providing humanitarian assistance to victims of crisis and disaster-directly in line with the goals of DIMO. Just as the State Department is at the forefront of providing leadership in shaping international affairs, the Defense Institute for Medical Operations provides leadership for security at home and humanitarian and disaster response training and sustainment worldwide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2.0 Description of Services.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">27 May 2009</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br />1.0 Introduction. The Defense Institute for Medical Operations (DIMO) serves as a focal point for Air Force and Navy exportable and importable medical and disaster related courses, providing synergy for the development, maintenance, and implementation of training. The ultimate goal of the Institute is to provide training that improves host nations' and our nation's abilities to manage their own threats/crises and to respond as coalition partners in regional crises. The model supports teams of Total Force subject matter experts to "train the trainers" and collectively supports the theater security cooperation plans for the regional commanders and mission performance plans for the host country.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Institute provides oversight for the development and implementation of courses that meet national and regional Commanders' objectives. Recent events emphasized the need for an overall strategy for disaster preparedness at home and throughout the world. The training implemented by the Institute provides an excellent opportunity to augment this strategy through multilateral engagement-building international medical bridges through collective approaches to public health, disease prevention and response to man-made and natural disasters. The U. S. International affairs goals include improving the global health environment and providing humanitarian assistance to victims of crisis and disaster-directly in line with the goals of DIMO. Just as the State Department is at the forefront of providing leadership in shaping international affairs, the Defense Institute for Medical Operations provides leadership for security at home and humanitarian and disaster response training and sustainment worldwide.</p>

<DESC>Q3000090458 FRDO Emergency Operation Plan - Questions and Answers1.	On p.6 of your document, you state that there will be 20 pages of the Flip Chart, 250 pages of the EOP, 35 pages of the Utility section, and 150 pages of the Collection Recovery Inventory. Since the document has not yet been produced, I would use these page numbers as approximate, not fixed numbers.  
Yes, that is correct.
2.	On p.8 under "*_Reports and Deliverables_*" the proposal lists that the final product will be in Microsoft Word as follows:
               cd roms-10               FRDO Emergency Quick Guide -  156               FRDO Emergency Operations Plan -  21               FRDO Building and Utilities Inventory and Floorplans -21               FRDO Museum Collection Recovery Inventory - 10                          On p.9 under _*PRODUCTS*_ you state the final product will result in 25 copies of the Flip Chart for staff. There will also be 10 copies of the comprehensive plan in binder with all appendices, maps, etc., as well as 10 CD-ROMs of the plan, etc. 
Please provide clarification on the exact number of the EOPs to be printed
The quantities specified in the combined synopsis are mis-stated. Reports and Deliverables section should read:      cd roms-10      FRDO Emergency Quick Guide -  25      FRDO Emergency Operations Plan -  20      FRDO Building and Utilities Inventory and Floorplans -20      FRDO Museum Collection Recovery Inventory - 10
3.	The RFQ specified 10 "indexed" copies of draft 1 in hard copy. I guess by indexed it means tabbed? So I guess we should assume 10 hard copies of each draft also. 
Yes, tabbed and yes to 10 drafts
4.	Will we use the double-siding instead of sleeving?  
Use the double sided copying
5.	Will NPS format flipchart to align page lengths or will I?  
Contractor will format, followed by any additional work needed by editor.
6.	Are there any preferences for the type of paper to be used?
The utility section and collection salvage section shall be printed on water resistant paper such as Rite in Rain paper or similar alternative.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is PC-09-Q-015 and is issued as a Request for Quotation. The Peace Corps anticipates awarding a non-competitive sole source fixed-price purchase order for Auditorium audio cabling and AMX, multi-media switch programming Corbett Technology Solutions, Inc. The applicable NAICS code is 334310 and size standard is $14.0M. This is a 100% Small Business set aside. Numbered Note 1 applies. The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-35. FAR 52.212-1 is hereby incorporated by reference. Selected offerors must submit a complete copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with its offer.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, via e-mail, to Mr. Jeffrey Bradley, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 692-1622, jbradley@peacecorp.gov, by 12:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on July 31, 2009. Interested organizations should submit a complete package by the due date, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government’s requirement and which describes the capability of their maintenance and repair services as it supports the requirement. The Government will not pay for information solicited. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit their qualifications by the due date which may be considered by the agency. Submission of information for review by the Peace Corps shall not impede award of this purchase order. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Firms must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) prior to award of any contracts or agreements.

The Peace Corps requires:

This is the scope of work to upgrade the audio system in Shriver auditorium.  
 
1.  The conference room is broken down into three sections (Shriver A, B, C).  Each room needs to be both independently wired for audio, as well as be tied into a single system (to be used when all three rooms are combined into one large room).
 
2.  The audio will be tied into the current AMX system that was recently installed.  This system is controlled by touch panels (one for each room), and will ultimately be able to give the end user the ability to independently run the audio from each room without the need for an audiovisual technician to be on hand.
 
3.  In order to accomplish this, the system will need to be programmed to digitally control the incoming audio signal – additionally, the room will need to be completely rewired to accommodate the placement of microphones and speakers.

General
 
1. All equipment shall be installed as to present no safety hazards to the public,
to operating personnel, to equipment or to other trades.
 
2. All equipment must be adequately ventilated when operating under worst-case
power dissipation.
 
3. Materials and equipment required for a complete system but not specified
herein as to manufacturer or quality shall be of high commercial standard and
quality.
 
Software
 
1. All software programs and their associated hardware components must be
fully installed, programmed and configured.
 
2. Before the system is deemed complete and ready for final acceptance all
software and hardware issues must be rectified.
 
3. All software programming must be performed by manufacturer trained and
authorized personnel.
 
4. All software programming shall meet manufacturer’s recommendations and
best industry practices. Expect that the manufacturer may be requested to review
their programming. At the discretion of the Systems Engineer, the Contractor
may be directed to modify their program to the manufacturer’s directions.
 
5. Deliver two complete copies of the software (source code) for all processors
and touch panels to the Client with the system manuals.
 
Wiring and Cable Termination
 
1. Take all necessary precautions to prevent electromagnetic and electrostatic
interference. Care should be taken during wiring and installation to prevent
damage to wire or equipment. Use best industry practices to ensure long-term
reliability.
 
2. All terminations of shielded twisted pair cables, regardless of location, shall
consist of a Teflon, PVC or neoprene sleeve covering the shield drain wire and
an overall heat shrink or elastic neoprene sleeve covering the point at which the
cable jacket and shield end. (This makes it very difficult to inadvertently ground a
shield and is an important aspect of audio system wiring.) At the termination the
unshielded leads shall be less than 50 mm in length but not so short as to
present undue stress of the soldered joint.
 
3. All wiring entering the racks shall have a service loop (slack), allowing future
rewiring. This slack wire shall be neatly harnessed into place.
 
4. All cable and cable bundles shall be neatly and logically routed and organized.
Bundles of varying signal level shall be spaced at least 10 cm apart and secured
to dedicated tie bars. Wiring in racks shall not be left unsupported.
 
5. Do not attach cables to the fire-sprinkler system, electrical distribution of any
system or any ancillary equipment or hardware. The cable system and support
hardware shall be installed so that operation of any valves, fire panels, access
doors, or control devices are not impeded.
 
6. Install all cables in continuous lengths from origin to destination. Splices are
unacceptable.
 
7. Audio and control terminations shall be made with rosin-core solder or an
approved mechanical connector. Crimp only with manufacturer's recommended
crimping tool having a controlled crimp cycle.
 
8. Mechanically connected XLR and phone plugs will not be allowed.
 
9. RF terminations shall be made with crimp connectors only (no screw-on
connectors)
 
10. As some audio signal cables may share a conduit with control cables (e.g.
Paging Mics), take appropriate precautions to prevent pops and clicks in the
system. Control circuits that require a reference shall not share audio shields as
their reference.
 
Audio Interconnection
 
1. All microphone and line level wiring outside of racks shall be balanced and
floating, unless otherwise indicated or required by the source or destination
devices.
 
2. All microphone and line level wiring to be balanced, except where specified
equipment has unbalanced terminations.
 
3. Unless otherwise noted, all microphone and line level connections to be via
XLR connectors, except as required by source or destination devices
 
Video Interconnection
 
1. All BNC type video connectors shall be of high quality with a crimp style strain
relief.
 
2. All other “line level” type video connectors shall be of high quality with the
opposing mating surfaces composed of similar metal types.
 
3. Ensure that all Video transmission paths are properly terminated with the
appropriate device.
 
Control and Data Interconnection
 
1. All data and control connectors shall be of high performance and quality.
 
2. All opposing mating surfaces shall be of similar metals.
 
3. All connections shall maintain telecommunication industry defined impedances
for that particular circuit type and connection.
 
4. Ensure that all Data and Digital transmission paths are properly terminated
with the appropriate device.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.

INTRODUCTION

As part of OPS, the OFDA Safety and Security Coordinator (SSC) and Safety and Security Specialist (SSS) play a central role in the U.S. Government’s (USG’s) disaster response, humanitarian assistance, and disaster risk management programs.  The Safety and Security Unit (SSU) assists the office in identifying, evaluating and mitigating safety and security risks to OFDA field operations.  The SSU monitors security issues and events, develops security strategies, protocols and procedures, and maintains a cadre of qualified security professionals available for OFDA deployments.  The OFDA SSU also promotes enhanced safety and security approaches in the wider humanitarian community, including NGOs and United Nations (UN) agencies, through their outreach and donor activities.

OBJECTIVE

OPS requires the services of a Safety and Security Specialist in order to enhance its capability to manage the increasing safety and security issues related to OFDA field deployments.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

•	Monitor security situations in countries and regions in which OFDA has, or may have, staff.
•	Provide general and country-specific security guidance and briefings to OFDA staff as needed.
•	Conduct periodic site visits in support of OFDA/DRM and Regional Team safety and security needs, including comprehensive safety and security assessments and development of safety and security plans.
•	Work with OFDA’s Training Unit to refine and develop security related training materials as needed.  
•	Assist in managing OFDA’s cadre of Safety and Security Officers.
•	Working with OFDA/DRM, assist in the identification and evaluation of humanitarian security initiatives to increase NGO and UN capacity to improve their overall security management. 
•	Work with OFDA/DRM and Regional Teams to coordinate and track the activities of OFDA staff as they relate to security.
•	Liaise with USAID Office of Security, Department of State Diplomatic Security, other USG agencies, UN, and NGO offices on the issue of staff safety and security, as appropriate.  This may include participation in inter-agency security fora.  Establish relationships with other relevant organizations such as the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), and the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS).  
•	Serve on OFDA Response Management Teams (RMT) and Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART) as Safety and Security Officer (or other positions), as required.
•	Manage OFDA’s Duty Officer program.
•	Manage OFDA’s Security Information distribution lists.
•	Become a certified Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative/Agreement Officer’s Technical Representative and assist in the management of security-related grants, cooperative agreements and contracts.

•	Serve as OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.  

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The OFDA Safety and Security Specialist will report directly to the Safety and Security Coordinator, who in turn reports to the OPS Division’s Field Support Team Leader.  He/she will work closely with USAID/SEC (Office of Security), in order to ensure consistency with overall USAID security objectives and the sharing of information between OFDA and SEC.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The incumbent is expected to take initiative, work in a collaborative manner, yet able to act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.  The supervisor will set overall objectives.  The Safety and Security Specialist will work with the Safety and Security Coordinator to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be done.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for developing power-efficient and remotable high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) with high resolution. The proposed program (Remoted Analog-to-Digital Converters with De-serialization and Reconstruction or RADER) research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in analog-to-digital conversion. ADC systems enabled by RADER technology will be capable of operating in continuous time over a 10 GHz input instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) with a resolution of 10 effective number of bits (ENOB). Ultimately, it is desirable to be able to place the 10 GHz IBW so that input signals with frequency content of up to 18 GHz are captured. However, RADER technology demonstrations will focus on 10 GHz IBW at baseband (all Phases) in addition to 6 GHz IBW centered at 15 GHz (Phase III). Of particular interest is achieving these impressive goals within a dense input signal environment while simultaneously limiting the amount of dc power consumed to less than 50 Watts. Furthermore, in most applications, it is advantageous to sense analog waveforms at a point remoted from the components or subsystems that require significant portions of the power budget. The realization of such a continuous time analog-to-digital (A/D) system would create a unique new capability beyond the range of existing ADCs. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. 
All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to DARPA-BAA-09-51@darpa.mil. See full BAA document attached.</p>

This is a new addition or new contract to expand the existing HP server infrastructure. The IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure is the core infrastructure used to provide ESOC services. The IT Virtual Infrastructure provides virtual servers to host customer systems, allowing the ESOC to consolidate customer systems from stand-alone servers into an efficient, highly available, centrally managed infrastructure. The IT Virtual Infrastructure also provides virtual servers used internally to host the ESOC infrastructure services (e.g. Active Directory, DHCP, backup, availability monitoring configuration management. As part of the Data Center Consolidation effort, the ESOC is modernizing the IT Virtual Infrastructure onto a higher density blade server environment. This High Density Computing environment is the modern data center platform approach for IT to meet the continuously growing business demands for faster and more powerful servers, services, and applications. High density computing includes the hardware with vast processing power in a small physical footprint. By consolidating numerous less powerful servers into a high-density solution, IRM can provide the increasing demand for services while also lowering Total Cost of Ownership. HP servers have long served as the ESOC core infrastructure. The current purchase is an extension of the existing infrastructure and is required to maintain consistency across sites to ensure the ability to centrally support the customer light-out ESOCs. This is in full compliance with our FISMA reporting responsibilities and the Presidents Management Agenda. 41USC 253(c )(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirement as a key component of the Departments IRM IT Virtual Infrastructure. This purchase is an extension of the investment already made in this brand name. this is not a completely new installation but builds upon existing infrastructure.<BR><BR>52.203-15 Whistleblower Protections Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009) (http://www.recovery.gov) 52.204-11 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-Reporting Requirements (Mar 2009) 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items (Apr 2009)  (Alternate II  Mar 2009) 52.214-26 Audit and Records-Sealed Bidding (Mar 2009)<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Recovery Act Contract Action - Providing radiologic outcomes for the Osteoarthritis Initiative through longitudinal, blinded to order qualitative and quantitative assessment x-ray analysis of knee joint changes
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIAMS-RDSS-10-20

<CONTACT>Lisa A Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0346, Fax 301-480-3432, Email lh314r@nih.gov
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION TO A PREVIOUS NOTICE IS TO REVISE THE NAICS CODE. 

RECOVERY ACT CONTRACT ACTION – This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute for National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) issues this source sought notice in an effort to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform this requirement.  Small businesses are encouraged to respond. The period of performance is eleven months with the option to extend the contract for an additional year. 

The Osteoarthritis Initiative is a public-private partnership to generate research resources to increase knowledge and improve understanding of the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis in the population.  The goals of the Osteoarthritis Initiative are currently being fulfilled through five current NIH funded research and development contracts.  Four of these contracts are awarded to clinical centers to enroll subjects, collect data and follow the cohort, and one contract is the data coordinating center, the University of California, San Francisco to manage the study and to establish and maintain the database.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide x-ray readings and scoring of knee x-rays from the baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 month x-rays from the participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  This will provide outcome data to enrich the database.  These readings will allow users to know whether subjects without disease have developed disease or subjects with disease have gotten worse.  This information is critical for evaluation of potential risk factors for development or progression of disease.  Providing these readings through a standardized method will eliminate the variability that would result from many different individuals reading these x-rays independently. The resultant data will be posted on the Osteoarthritis Initiative public website after review by the staff at the data coordinating center at the UCSF. Two types of readings, done in a blinded to order manner are required: quantitative assessment of joint space width and change in joint space and semi-quantitative assessment of joint changes including the Kellgren-Lawrence score. The proposed readings are not “commercial” items.  They are not conventional clinical readings that might be offered by a radiology department to primary care doctors for diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. Rather, they are research readings that require the collection of a large set of predefined variables from the radiographs that are useful only in the research setting. These readings require structured protocols to maximize the accuracy and reduce sources of error. These readings are unique to research assessments due to the following requirements; assessment of a large set of individual radiographic features, which are not used clinically, readings of grouped images from multiple time points for precise measurement of change, readings of images blinded to chronological order, use of multiple readers to assess same images to increase accuracy and reduce error, identification and adjudication of discrepancies between multiple readers by outside party, precise measurement of joint space width at multiple points across the joint and precise comparisons of change in joint space width from image to image.  

Capabilities Statements will be evaluated based upon the following evaluation criteria: 

1. Adequacy of technical approach to provide reliable readings using well established and accepted methodologies for both quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of longitudinal x-rays from the OAI.
2. Ability to properly handle, process, store, and disburse x-rays and data.
3. Ability to work cooperatively with the Government to establish clear and well documented policies and procedures for access to x-rays/data.
4. Ability to work cooperatively with the Government to address various ethical, legal, policy, and regulatory issues related to collection, access, and distribution of x-rays including evidence that the offeror is familiar with processes and procedures relevant to shipping and receiving x-rays to and from subcontractor sites.
5. Documented training and expertise for various tasks related to the operation and maintenance and familiarity with various ethical, legal, and policy issues related to collection, access, and distribution of x-rays.
6. Leadership and management structure must include the documented training, experience, leadership, and availability of a lead Principal Investigator with solid research program management experience. It should also include documented experience in managing subcontracts and suitability of proposed plans for start-up and for orderly transition to a successor contractor or the Government. The administrative framework must indicate clear lines of authority and responsibility. These include adequacy and feasibility of the proposed staffing for the conduct of the project, including the appropriateness of the time commitments for proposed staff, the clarity and appropriateness of assigned roles, responsibilities, plans for back-up staffing as the need arises, and the logistical adequacy of the proposed staffing plan. 
7. The offeror should demonstrate adequacy, availability and accessibility of existing resources such as computer equipment, computer software, web systems, data security, and office space necessary to effectively carry out all phases of the proposed project, including plans for back-up in case of equipment malfunction.

This is not a request for a competitive quotation.  However, if an interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must demonstrate the ability to provide the x-ray reading services and assessments as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services, as described above.  All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIAMS to determine if the party can perform this requirement (responses should not exceed 20 pages including attachments). Responses providing insufficient information will not be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, The University of California, San Francisco, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The University of California, San Francisco is located at 3333 California Street San Francisco, CA 94143 and is currently operating under contract number N01-AR-2-2258.  The NAICS code is 541712. Statements of capability must be received at the following address (or by email as a Word document or PDF) no later than 4:00 pm local time, July 30, 2009:  National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Rockledge II – Room 6102, 6701 Rockledge Drive – MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902 (use 20817 for express mail), Attention: Lisa A.

To All Prospective Offerors:

The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is seeking proposals from qualified organizations interested in providing the services as described in the attached solicitation. 

USAID plans to award a Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) term type, cost reimbursement contract. 

You have received this document through the USAID Internet site.  Some of the Attachment/Forms/Appendices/Exhibits in Section J have been supplied to you electronically.  Other Attachments/Forms/Appendices/Exhibits, which may not be included electronically in this solicitation, may be found at http://www.USAID.GOV/procurement_bus_opp/procurement/forms/ or by contacting the person in block 10 on page 1 of the SF 33. 

If you have received this RFP electronically, then you must notify the contact person listed in block 10 of the original SF33 of the original RFP by fax or e-mail. As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, please be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.  Generally, the Contracting Officer will send copies of amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt.  However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the Internet.  You are therefore advised to regularly check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizops.gov/) for amendments.

Please pay careful attention to Section K - Representations, Certifications and Acknowledgements of the accompanying Request for Proposals. Offerors are now expected to comply with FAR clause 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, and complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Offerors must carefully adhere to Section L - Instructions to Offerors and Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award. Sections B through J of the solicitation will become the basis for the contract.  Any blanks in Sections B through J will be completed by the Contracting Officer before award.  

You are strongly encouraged to submit any comments or questions concerning this RFP by no later than August 21 2009. These should be directed to Mr. Thomas M. Stephens, Regional Contracting Officer and attention to Ms. Maria Rosario M. Arenas, Senior Acquisition Specialist, USAID/RDMA, Bangkok, Thailand by fax, (662) 263-7498, or e-mail. Mr. Stephens and Ms. Arenas may be reached at the following e-mail addresses, respectively: tstephens@usaid.gov and marenas@usaid.gov.

The Proposal shall be prepared in two separate parts: the Technical Proposal shall address technical aspects only while the Business (Cost) Proposal shall present the costs and address related issues such as responsibility. Offerors shall submit one (1) original and five (5) copies of their Technical Proposal in a sealed envelope which is clearly marked as being in response to this RFP. Offerors shall submit one (1) original and one (1) copy of their Business Proposal separately in a sealed envelope indicating that it is in response to this RFP and contains cost information. One copy each of the technical and business proposals shall also be submitted within the sealed envelopes on electronic medium (disk or CD) with text in WORD and budgets in EXCEL.  Proposals must be signed by an official who is authorized to bind the organization.

The required closing date and time for receipt of proposals at the USAID/RDMA office in Bangkok, Thailand is 4:00 P.M. Bangkok local time on September 25, 2009.  Point of required receipt is at USAID/RDMA, Bangkok, Thailand and not at USAID in Washington, D.C. or at any other location.  Offerors should take account of the expected delivery time required by the proposal transmission method they choose, and are responsible to ensure that proposals are received at USAID/RDMA by the due date and time specified above.  Faxed proposals are not acceptable.  The normal method of transmission for proposals should be by international courier or by mail; proposals submitted via e-mail will also be accepted (see Section L of the RFP).

Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of the contract will not be binding.  Issuance of this solicitation does not obligate USAID to award a contract, nor will USAID pay any costs associated with the preparation or submission of proposals.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all offers, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government. Award of a contract under this RFP is subject to availability of funds and other internal USAID approvals.

Thank you for your interest in USAID programs.


Sincerely,	


Thomas M. Stephens
Regional Contracting Officer
USAID/RDMA, Bangkok

<DESC><p>Solicitation<br />Removal and Replacement of Switchgear<br />Eielson AFB, AK 99702
<p>The work consists of the contractor furnishing all engineering, labor, equipment, and materials to perform the work required, in strict accordance with specifications and applicable drawings.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of work: The removal and replacement of 480V switchgear 1A and 1B at the Eielson AFB Power Plant. Each switchgear lineup consists of a 7200V knife blade switch, a 7200V-408V transformer and a distribution center. Phasing of the project during construction will require close coordination with the power plant personnel, and contractor providing temporary sources of power. Since there are many scenarios of plant operation needs, phasing the transition of the power feeders from the existing to the new switchgear replacement is an integral part of the work to maintain the operational needs of the CHPP. A load study and a short-circuit/coordination study/arc flash hazard analysis are required. Requirements include final connections of associated equipment and ancillary work. Operation, maintenance and arc flash safety training are required.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be firm fixed price. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 238210 with a size standard of $14 million. The magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This acquisition is being solicited IAW FAR 19.5, Set Aside for Small Business.

This can be:*  an existing published wage determination*  a survey underlying a wage determination*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on   a wage determination matter*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) rulingOn survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed.With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations	Wage and Hour Division	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 202102.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an interested party (those affected by the action) can request review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:	Wage and Hour Administrator	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 202103ATTACHMENT 7VA256-09-RP-0231The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:	Administrative Review Board	U.S. Department of Labor	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.	Washington, DC 202104.)

Please provide a plant legend, quantity, size and layout at the location to be installed, if we are required to include this work in our proposal.  RESPONSE: Provide 4" of top soil in planter locations, no planting material is required.2QUESTION #17: Section 08 41 13 Aluminum Entrances and Storefronts1.1 Description is calling for a 1 3/4 x 4 1/2 stick system / all of the window details are drawn as a 6" curtainwall system (same detail on both systems). We need to find out if the architect wants to use 6" curtainwall everywhere or does he want to use two different systems on the building? All of the stick systems that we have located for the storefront elevations are 2 x 5 and they are all interior set systems; we would prefer to use 6" curtainwall at all elevations, but we will use whatever system the architect would like us to use.RESPONSE: Refer to section 08 41 13 paragraph 1.1.2.b. change to read "Outside glazed silicone glazed 2 " sight lines 6" deep section.1QUESTION #18: On drawing P101 there are several references about using air admittance valves. The Louisiana plumbing code does not allow the use of these devices.  Please advise if you want to use these valves or not.RESPONSE: The use of air admittance valves is correct for this federal project.QUESTION #19: On Drawing M201, Note #5 calls for the chilled water pipe to be heat traced above and below grade back to the building.  The specifications, page 203, calls for heat trace on piping exposed to weather.  Which application will apply:RESPONSE: The chilled water piping shall be heat-traced above and below grade as described in keyed note 5 on sheet M201.  The statement in the specifications may be revised to read:  "Chilled water piping above and below grade from building to chiller and all other areas exposed to the weather.3

<DESC>The flood of 2008 deposited large quantities of driftwood on the face of the Saylorville Lake Barrier Dam.  The Barrier Dam is located off of highway 415 adjacent to the Saylorville Marina and approximately 1.5 miles south of Polk City, IA. Contractor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of all logs on the dam over 6in in diameter (measured exceeding anywhere on the log length). Access to the driftwood is only available from the Neal Smith Bike Trail located at the foot of the dam.  Care in removal is needed to insure no damage is done to the rip rap surface of the dam. Any damage or displacement of rip rap shall be replaced by the contractor at their expense.  Once driftwood logs are removed from the face of the dam they are to be hauled to a designated dump site where they are to be chipped.<BR><BR>Work will consist of walking up and down large rip-rap rock on face of dam.  Trees will be pulled/lifted from the face of the dam to the bottom of the dam with minimal movement of rip rap.  Chainsaw work may be required to cut larger pieces of driftwood for ease of handling and hauling.  Any rip-rap that is moved in the process needs to be put back into its original position.  Once the trees/logs have been removed from the face of the dam the contractor will be required to haul trees to Sandpiper Recreation Area (1.1 mile) for them to be chipped.  The dump location is a flat, level, open terrain for ease of dumping and chipping.  <BR><BR>On the west side of the barrier dam between the bike trail and the dam is a small grove of trees which need to be removed.  Trees need to flush cut to the ground.  All trees in the area need to be taken out except for the Pin Oak.  Pin Oak trees will be marked by the Government with orange paint. Contractor shall use extreme care not to damage the Pin Oak trees.<BR><BR>Work for this contract is to be completed thirty (30) work days after contract award. Work days are Monday through Friday between the hours of 7 am and 5 pm. No work will be permitted on weekends or holidays.  Five working days will be allowed to remove the driftwood from the rip rap. Chipping of the driftwood will be completed within two weeks of driftwood removal from the dam. Inclement weather may inhibit safe work and if so, the Government will allow for additional work days. <BR>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 3 is to make changes to Section H and Section I of the Solicitation document, provide additional questions and answers, and post a revised DD254 form and guidance document.
<p>Section H is amended by a adding the following:</p>
<p>H.6 MANUFACTURING RESTRICTIONS <br />The contractor and any subcontractors shall be a domestic entity and deliver only end products where place of manufacture is in the United States at a Security Cleared facility. Components of the end products must also have place of manufacture in the United States at a Security Cleared facility. Domestic entity has the meaning given by 7701(a)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 2008. United States means the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Place of manufacture means the place where an end product is assembled out of components, or otherwise made or processed from raw materials into the finished product that is to be provided to the Government. Any transformation of material (i.e. bending, cutting, autoclave) must be performed in the United States at a Security Cleared facility. If a product is disassembled and reassembled, the place of reassembly is not the place of manufacture. Raw material of foreign origin may be used in compliance with 52.225-13-Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, and only where the agency determines are not mined or produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of satisfactory quality. The cost of foreign raw material may not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the end product. Costs of foreign raw material include all costs associated with the purchase of the material including transportation. <br /><br />Section I is amended by deleting clause 52.225-5, Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>Question: Could you please provide more information regarding what you term in your answer above as "production" being "done" and further stated "must be done by a U.S. company at a plant in the U.S." Also, is there a contract clause that defines the security restrictions on this contract? If we are to maintain a firewall between our foreign facility and our domestic (secret clearance holding US Citizen) engineering staff where no classified information flows between the two does this meet your security requirements?</p>
<p>Answer: The addition to Section H established as part of this solicitation amendment 3 states manufacturing restrictions applicable to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Question: A question regarding possible statement conflicts on DD254_Addendum_1<br />Item 3 states: "contactor personnel may have access to classified information/hardware that will be received and/or generated at the contractor's facility."<br />Item 4 states: "If automated data processing of classified or sensitive information is required, it will be performed at a USSS facility."<br />I believe "automated data processing" can refer to most any use of a computer. Likewise, generating classified information will most likely be done on a computer. I would request a better definition of "automated data processing" or insight into how these two statements should be interpreted.</p>
<p>Answer: "Automated data processing" or "use of a computer" is not required to be performed at a USSS facility under this contract. As described in paragraph 1 of DD254 Addendum 1, all components of this contract will be in compliance with DSS regulations DOD 5220.22-M. Chapter 8, Information System Security, details regulatory requirements for this subject. A revised DD254 and guidance (DD254- SSD Pre-Award, DD254 Security Guidance) has been posted with this amendment.</p>

This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).
<p>The technical tasks of the program are: Baseline Correlation of Inspection Data to Airflow, Demonstration Trial of Geometry, Production Development of Inspection and Predictive Airflow Model, Production Implementation Trials of Inspection and Predictive Airflow Models.</p>

<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA) of 2009.  In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder (TO) 28 was issued under contract NNJ08JB01C, the Environmental Contract, toprocure environmental services in support of Hurricane Ike Phase II roof repairs fundedby the Recovery Act.  The environmental services under this TO support the roofreplacements known as Roof Package 2, contracted for under Contract NNJ09JD51C.  Theenvironmental services include environmental compliance oversight, industrial solid wastetransportation and disposal, and review of all plans, specifications, and drawings toensure environmental requirements are included in each roof replacement project.  Inaddition modification 58 was issued for associated funding. &lt;P&gt; Also, Task Orders  15, 16, 17, 19 and 25 were issued for cleaning and caulking theleaking precast exposed aggregate facing panels; barge dock repairs; replacement of thehangar at Ellington Field; replacement of the roof at building 9S; and repair of street,parking lot and sidewalk lights. &lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The Environmental Contract was awarded on a competitive basis.	These Task Orders wereissued under the cost-type contract arrangement in accordance with the contract.  Acost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertainties involved in contractperformance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use anytype of fixed-price contract.  In addition a cost-type contract was selected to providethe contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given thetypes of services to be performed.  This Environmental Contract has experienced personneland documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet therequirements of the Recovery Act in the most prudent business manner, with the timeconstraints imposed, the existing Environmental Contract is the most appropriatecontractual vehicle for the work required.  &lt;P&gt;Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SOLE SOURCE

OFFICE OF MEDICAL SERVICES, WASHINGTON, DC

(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a ‘SOLE SOURCE’ justification.

       Department of State
	Office of Medical Services
	2401 E Street, NW
	Washington, DC 20522-0101
	Contact – James M. Walters, (202) 663-1932
       MED/EX/MSS
	
(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

      Sole Source Justification for the emergency purchase of the new Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine called Ixiaro which is solely distributed by Novartis.  Novartis is the manufacturer for the Ixiaro vaccine and was approved by the FDA in March 30, 2009.

(3)	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value).  

370 packages of Ixiaro vaccine are needed.  With what is currently on hand, this quantity will be sufficient to inoculate 200 DOS Foreign Service Officers and family members being posted to areas where the JE disease in prevalent. Estimated value for the vaccines is   $72,150.00.  

(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.   

41 USC 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency. The Department’s need for Ixiaro vaccine is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured in the event of a delay in award of a contract. 

(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

Novartis is the sole authorized distributor of the FDA approved JE vaccine Ixiaro in the United States.  It is also the only commercial source of this drug.  Market research from GSA Advantage shows several vendors who hold the schedule for pharmaceutical products; however, there is only one or two that list they handle this vaccine, Ixiaro.  Sole Source justification is required as this vaccine, Ixiaro is the only one available that is used to prevent the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and the manufacturer is Novartis.  JE is potentially life-threatening for travelers as well as those who are stationed in high potential areas of Asia from the Department of State and their families.

(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
 
Novartis is the only company able to supply Ixiaro at this time.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Supply Service Center at Perry Point Maryland was contacted on June 19th, and had none available.  Amerisource-Bergen, the pharmaceutical “Prime Vendor” used by MED Washington, was also checked and is unable to supply any Ixiaro. 

FAR part 5.202 (2) applies: The contract action is being made under unusual and compelling urgency as stated in FAR 6.302-2 and the government would be seriously injured if the Department complies with the time periods specified in 5.203. 

(7)	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. 

Novartis has established the Ixiaro selling price of $195 per package.  This is the same price it is offering to all its customers.  There is no alternative JE vaccine product available since production ceased on Sanofi-Pasteur’s JE-VAX.  When it was available JE-VAX sold for $275.75 per package under FSS V797P-5949X.

(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 

Research was conducted and it was determined that Novartis is the only vendor that will be able to supply the JE vaccine Ixiaro.  Market research from GSA Advantage shows several vendors who hold the schedule for pharmaceutical products; however, there is only one or two that list they handle this vaccine, Ixiaro.  Information from the Novartis website affirms that this is the only vaccine known at this time to immunize against JE.  The vaccine is provided as a ready-to-use liquid formation in pre-filled syringes and is administered in two doses 28 days apart for an active immunization.

(9)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. 

IRT: FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency: It is essential that an inventory of Ixiaro be purchased to be used to protect the health and wellbeing of U.S. Diplomats and their family members being assigned to areas of the world where JE is endemic.  JE is an acute inflammatory condition of the brain and spinal cord.  This virus is life threatening to those who are in these regions of Asia.  The transmission of JE is linked to the seasonality of the mosquitoes in these areas.  Many of these areas are tropical climates which hold a potential for year round transmission and elsewhere, peak periods of increased viral transmission follows monsoon seasons.  

AG Novatis and Intercell have strategic alliance that provides Novartis with the commercialization rights to Ixiaro.  

(10)	 A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. 

Novartis is the only authorized distributor of Ixiaro in the USA at this present time.

(11)	 A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  

Since there is no other company that provides this vaccine at the present time, we do not for see any problems with competition issues.

(12)	Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer’s knowledge and belief.

<p>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management, (EM) Consolidated Business Center (CBC) intends to extend the current Environmental Management Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contracts. The Office of Environmental Management is responsible for the risk reduction and cleanup of the environmental legacy of the Nation's nuclear weapons program, one of the largest, most diverse, and technically complex environmental programs in the world. Services performed under these contracts include Environmental Remediation/Waste Management Services, Deactivation, Demolition, and Removal of Buildings (DD&amp;R) (Contaminated) and Deactivation, Demolition and Removal of Buildings (DD&amp;R) (Non-contaminated) at various locations throughout the United States in support of the EM's mission to restore contaminated sites to a state protective of human health and the environment. Examples of sites where cleanup work is being performed include the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Project, Separations Process Research Unit (SPRU), and Miamisburg Closure Project (Mound Site). Examples of task order objectives issued under the IDIQ are as follows:</p>
<p>o Environmental restoration of approximately fifteen acres of soil and groundwater contaminated with radioactivity and chemicals in the Separations Process Research Unit (SPRU) land areas. <br />o Deactivation, demolition, and removal of the Separations Process Research Unit (SPRU) nuclear facilities; cleanup and environmental restoration of the underlying and surrounding contaminated soil; and, decontamination of piping tunnel connecting the SPRU facilities to other operating facilities.<br />o Excavation and shipment by rail car of 2.25 million tons of Residual Radioactive Material (RRM) from the Moab site<br />o Removal of radioactive materials and contamination from the Operable Unit 1 (OU-1) Project Area on the Miamisburg Closure Project to levels allowing for industrial reuse of the site</p>
<p>This proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a). The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The current Nationwide IDIQ contract is set to expire on October 7th, 2009. The proposed action will extend the current five year period of performance by six months to April 6th 2010. This will be a no-cost extension where the sole purpose is to bridge the time period from when the current ordering period ends (October 7, 2009), until the follow-on Nationwide IDIQ contracts are awarded.</p>
<p>There are 21 current Nationwide IDIQ awardees, as listed below:</p>
<p>1. Pangea, Inc. .<br />2. TN &amp; Associates <br />3. C/P/E Environmental Services <br />4. EnergySolutions Federal Services <br />5. CDM <br />6. URS Group, Inc.<br />7. TetraTech, Inc. <br />8. LATA Sharp Remediation Services<br />9. Accelerated Remediation Co. <br />10. TolTest, Inc. <br />11. Bechtel National Inc. <br />12. MWH Americas, Inc.<br />13. Washington Group International Inc<br />14. SEC Federal Services <br />15. PM Tech, Inc.<br />16. Innovative Technical Solutions Inc.<br />17. Bristol Environmental &amp; Engineering Services<br />18. North Wind Inc.<br />19. Nile, Inc.<br />20. Sharp &amp; Associates Inc.<br />21. Clauss Construction</p>
<p>EMCBC Office of Contracting is currently in the process of awarding two sets of Multiple Award IDIQ contracts similar to the current Nationwide IDIQ Multiple Award Contracts. DOE plans to competitively award two groups of multiple IDIQ contracts pursuant to FAR 15, FAR 19, DOE Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) 915, and DEAR 919. One solicitation will be set-aside for participation of small businesses only and another solicitation will be issued for participation of both large and small businesses. The scopes of work for both solicitations will be similar (ER, WM, D&amp;D); however, the scope of work for the Multiple Award unrestricted IDIQ contracts will be for complex scopes of work (regulatory and/or technically complex) and/or larger scopes of work.

The projected award dates for the small business set aside and unrestricted solicitations are March 2010 and May 2010 respectively. The RFPs will be released to the public through FEDCONNECT (https://www.fedconnect.net) to the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website and will be available at the acquisition website, http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/IDIQ_Set_Aside/index.php.</p>
