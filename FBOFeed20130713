<DESC>This procurement is SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office intends to issue a Request For Proposal for a firm fixed construction contract for the reconstruction of failed portions of Galice Access Road, BLM Road 34-8-36, where over-steepened slopes and shotgun pipes have caused a failure of the fill slopes on this road. Work includes: full-depth pavement reclamation by pulverizing the surfacing of the existing access road with a rotary milling machine; saw-cutting up to 10 thick asphalt sections; construction of new base rock; asphalt surface treatment of the pulverized surfacing by chip-seal; reconstruction of fill slopes with riprap; construction of new ditches; install new culverts; removal of old culverts; installation of new outfall protection; construction of subsurface drainage features; and installation of temporary and permanent signing necessary to reconstruct  three sites.  These road reconstruction sites are located in Josephine County, west of Galice, Oregon.  The magnitude of this construction project is between $500,000.00 and $1,000,000.00.   The performance period is estimated to be from 9/15/13 through 12/15/13.  The NAICS code is 237310 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million.  The basis of award will utilize the best value continuum -- lowest price technically acceptable source selection process in accordance with FAR subpart 15.101-2 to result in an award to the responsible offeror pursuant to FAR subpart 9.1.  The technical/non-price evaluation factors are Experience, Key Personnel, and Past Performance where technical/non-price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Options will be evaluated in accordance with provision 52.217-4. The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about July 27, 2013.

The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient,accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s). The
design of this part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is anticipated pending configuration changes. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one
source underthe authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals,quotations or capability statements.
