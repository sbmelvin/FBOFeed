<CONTACT>Steven Perry, 3097821088
<DESC>NA Estimated draft solicitation issue date is August 5, 2002.  Estimated closing date of draft solicitation is August 20, 2002.  Estimated final solicitation issue date is September 10, 2002. Estimated final solicitation closing date is October 10, 2002.  The  U.S. Army is in the process of modernizing all Sets, Kits and Outfits (SKOs).  Each SKO consists of a wide variety of tools and equipment essential to providing support to the Army’s inventory of technologically advanced tactical and combat support weapon  systems to meet the Army’s Ordnance and Combat missions.  This process is incremental.  With the completion of each redesign, each SKO will be procured and fielded. The Army is soliciting proposals from large and small businesses to establish long-term Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contracts for various tool sets, kits and outfits (SK0s).  It is the Army’s intent to make multiple awards under this solic itation to both large and small businesses.  Individual delivery orders will be competed among all awardees unless it is determined that a specific delivery order should be competed exclusively among small business awardees.  The Army will follow the Feder al Acquisition Regulation's  “rule of two” in determining whether a specific delivery order is to be competed among small business awardees (See FAR 19.502(b)). SKO's are defined as:   	Sets:  a collection of tools/components used by a group, section, squad, platoon or unit usually supplemented by tool kits to perform an organizational mission. Unit of issue of Set (SE) 	Kits:  An assembly of tools/components in a small pouch or box designed for use and carried by an individual or crew. Unit of issue of Kit (KT) 	Outfits: An assemblage of tools or equipment.  May include separately type-classified items as a component such as: Pneumatic Tool and Compressor Outfit, Water Purification Outfit, Tool Outfit Hydraulic Systems Repair and Tool Outfit Pioneer Portable Elec tric Tools. Unit of issue of Outfit (OT). For your information, Army Tools are defined as an instrument, implement, utensil, device or machine, powered or hand operated, used in diagnosis, making operating adjustments, performing damage or fault repair and preventive maintenance of Army material. In order to promote competition this requirement has been divided into the following segments: 1. Mechanical Maintenance Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools used by automotive, aircraft, and equipment mechanics, and others in the mechanical trades for performing field maintenance and repair.  The kit is transported to its place of final u se in a single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 2. Construction/Engineer Tool Kits:  An assemblage of mostly hand tools, including powered hand tools, primarily used in the construction trades to perform construction and repair of facilities, power lines, etc.; transported to its place of final use in a  single person or multi-person carry tool container.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 3. Specialized Tool Kits:  Assemblages of hand tools, measuring tools and equipment, or special-purpose tools and equipment used to perform a specific mission not normally associated with mechanical maintenance or building trades.  These kits may be housed  in a single or multiple hand carry containers.  These kits are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 4. Containerized Shop Sets:  An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field tasks (maintenance, repair, assembly, disassembly, disabling, adjustment, testing, etc.) on equipment or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit i n a container or shelter, which is considered to be part of the mobile shop set.  Usually some of the components o f a mobile shop may be permanently mounted to the container or shelter by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to support wartime operations. 5. Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets: An assemblage of tools and machinery used to perform field maintenance or field construction, transported to its place of use as a unit in a purpose-built vehicle body or trailer, which is considered to be part of the shop set.  Usually some of the components of the shop set are permanently mounted to its “carrier” by mounting bolts or other fasteners.  These sets are “go-to-war” items used by the military in the battlefield to carry wartime operations. Each segment will be individually competed and awarded.  The Army intends to establish two award pools for each segment: one will be created under full and open competition and the other will be for small business concerns. Offerors may submit proposals for one or more segments.  Each segment shall require offerors to submit a technical, performance risk and price proposal based on a sample SKO requirement.  The Army reserves the right to issue a delivery order on the sample SKO proposals.  The Army further reserves the right to issue an order under the award pool established under full and open competition or the award pool of small business concerns, depending upon proposals received. Small business concerns may compete for the award pool to be established under full and open competition and the pool to be established exclusively for small business concerns.  Small business concerns may submit alternative proposals based on meeting or n ot meeting the non-manufacturers rule (see 13 CFR 121.406).  Proposals based on meeting the non-manufacturers rule must be supported by adequate documentation. Offerors not receiving an award to be included in a pool of awardees will be debriefed and will have an opportunity to file a protest.   In the event that a requirement for a delivery order is competed exclusively among small businesses and only one offeror meets the nonmanufacturing rule, the contracting officer will issue the order to that offeror provided the price is fair and reasonable  and all other technical and past performance considerations are met.  The contracting officer will substantiate any determination regarding whether a price is fair and reasonable and will not consider a courtesy offer from a large business unless the cont racting officer determines that the small business offer is unreasonable.  In the event that the small business offer is unreasonable, the contracting officer may cancel the competition and compete the requirement among the full and open pool of awardees.  Finally, a small business who is otherwise eligible for award may apply for a COC if the contracting officer determines that the small business is unable to meet the nonmanufacturers rule. Interested potential offerors are invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to discuss the solicitation.  The Pre-Proposal conference will take place at The Lodge (formerly Jumers), Bettendorf, IA from 8:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, August 20, 2002.  This conference is open to all contractors.  The Pre-Proposal Conference will be a working luncheon.  The cost of the luncheon is $10.00 due by August 15th, 2002.  Checks will be made out to TACOM-RI Protocol and mailed to AMSTA-LC (Protocol/Laura Batchel or), TACOM-RI, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL 61299-7630.  Sorry no credit card transactions.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS Market Survey --Sources Sought  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Civil Aviation Registry Division (AFS-700) has a requirement for purchase of the Concord eHealth Network and Performance Software Suite for support of the Registry Modernization System (RMS)/Electronic Document Management System (EDMS).  The requiring activity has complete a comprehensive evaluation of several vendors software and the determination has been made that the software package ''Concord eHealth Network and Performance Software Suite'' will be procured in accordance with AMS Sections 2.9.6 Configuration Management which states; "The NAS Architecture defines the allocation of agency requirements to the appropriate systems, facilities, and programs, and defines connectivity among them.  Integrated Product Teams and other designated organizations must establish program-level configuration management practices to control product configurations, and to maintain interfaces and interoperability with the other systems, facilities, and services comprising the NAS Architecture.  Integrated Product Teams must establish functional and product baselines, and must control changes to those baselines through IPT-level configuration control boards."  The FAA in issuing this Market Survey is trying to determine what the possibilities are for setting this requirement up as a 100% small business Set-aside limited to vendors that are fully authorized Concord software dealers.  Depending upon the response to this market survey, the FAA will make a determination to set-aside or not to set-aside.  Therefore each potential offeror will need to provide not only the information based on the quantities shown below but must also provide with their response a size statement, provide their Gross earnings for the last three calendar years, and if they have them, their Small Business Administrations certifications of SEDB, or 8(a) program or small business status.  The determination to set-aside or not will be based on numbers of responses meeting each category of business size, having the required authorizations from Concord, and that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality and delivery.  NAICS for this requirement is 541511 size standard of $21 million.      -- For this requirement, AMS allows for the acquisition of one standard software suite to be used to monitor FAA systems and equipment, thus assuring the compatibility of all systems, training, and support are standard and thus assures that all systems work as required.  The Concord eHealth Network and Performance Software Suite software has been determined to meet the FAA's requirements.   Competition will be limited to only those vendors that can provide written authorization from Concord showing that the vendor is a fully authorized dealer for Concord and that they have full authority and access to furnish all required software, software licenses, system maintenance support agreements, system training, and products listed below to support the FAA's requirement.  : eHealth E2E Console-qty-1 ea: Universal Elements-qty-70 ea; Wintask-qty-1; Application Response Agent-qty-5 ea; eHealth BT Studio-qty-1 ea; eHealth Live Health Application-qty-1 ea; eHealth SystemEdge-qty-50 ea; eHealth Universal AIM-qty-18 ea; eHealth Service Availability-qty- 2 ea; Maintenance for eHealth E2E Console-qty-1 ea; Maintenance Universal Elements-qty- 70 ea; Maintenance Wintask-qty- 1 ea; Maintenance eHealth Application Response Agent-qty-5 ea; Maintenance eHealth BT Studio-qty-1 ea; Maintenance eHealth Live Health Application-qty- 1 ea; Maintenance eHealth SystemEdge-qty-50 ea; Maintenance eHealth Universal AIM-qty-18 ea; Maintenance eHealth Service Availability-qty- 2 ea; Packaged General Consulting (5-days)-qty- 1 ea; Training Bundle-10 Days-qty-1 each; On-site Training for eHealth End User (2 day course) maximum of 12 students-QTY-1 each.   These services are the only available from Concorde as they are the source of the required proprietary  software that is being procured under this requirement.  The requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single software source as provided for under the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4.  Due to the proprietary nature of the software involved, there is no alternative source for this software.  For the FAA tools developed using the models to be recognized as valid, it is essential that the models represent the actual products as closely as possible and, in this case, the manufacturer is willing to provide versions of his actual software with additional capabilities that will allow it to be used in our testing, simulation, and analysis.   This notice is for informational purposes for Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises: DOT, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SADBU), has a program to assist small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned concerns to acquire short-term working capital assistance for transportation-related contracts.  Loans are available under the DOT Short Term Lending Program (STLP) at prime interest rates to provide accounts receivable financing.  The maximum line of credit is $500,000.

<DESC>The scope of this project requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to prevent upstream drainage from entering and splitting two closed landfills. The work includes, but is not limited to:    construction of approximately 4000 m of ditches, culverts and dikes along the east, northeast and southeast perimeters of both landfills, in order to divert all upstream drainage, including the South River. The depth and height of the ditches and dikes respectively, are expected to be approximately 1 m each. The work includes 17500 cubic meters of rock, which the contractor will be required to blast, crush and transport from a nearby quarry; and excavation of 38000 cubic meters of soil.   Some surveying, leveling and grading earthwork of the ditches, culverts and dikes will be required.   This project will run concurrently with the Landfill Face Stabilization Project, which is taking place on the south landfill known as TAB (Thule Air Base) 32.  The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October.    Additionally, Thule Air Base’s location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift.    Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is not other access.   Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally.  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $500,000 and $1,200,000.  The project is divided into two separate and distinct phases of work.  Each phase will be listed as a separate contract line item (CLIN) on a lump-sum basis under a Firm, Fixed-Price contract.   The first phase will be awarded for performance this year to complete the first 2000 m.   Phase (CLINs) 2 will start in 2006 to complete the remaining 2000 m.    The anticipated performance period for each phase is 365 days which includes a winter exclusionary period of 245 days from 15 September through 15 May wherein no work will be required.    Performance-Price Tradeoff (PPT) shall be used as the method of evaluation.     It is anticipated the solicitation documents, including specifications and drawings, shall be posted electronically on or about 1 March 2005 with offers due 30 days thereafter.    Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted.    This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(4) International Agreement, to only US and Danish firms.   Although no hard-copies of the solicitation will be distributed, those firms interested in receiving a CD ROM version may request such by writing to:  Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, PSC 73, APO AE 09716 or Detachment 1, 21 Contracting Squadron, U.S. Embassy, Dag Hammarskjolds Alle 24, DK-2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Charleston (SSCC), Code 50 is tasked to procure, deliver and install high frequency (HF) radio communications equipment for the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA).  This contract shall provide systems meeting all requirements specified in the solicitation. The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) is a HF radio network which provides essential emergency communications capabilities between federal, state, and local governments during emergencies or disasters.  This system is regarded as a "first responder" communications mechanism which may be used to maintain reliable long and short range radio communications with affected disaster areas without dependence upon more susceptible commercial terrestrial and satellite telecommunications networks. The FNARS upgrade will utilize Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188.141B (2G) and frequency shift keying (FSK) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188-110B. MIL-STD-188-141C (3G) ALE capability will be installed upon third generation availability. The FNARS HF system will be utilized to transmit and receive secure and non-secure voice and data. Data shall include, but not limited to, e-mail, text messages and images. Data rate requirements are expected to be range between 9,600 and 19,200 bauds per second (BPS). A typical FNARS system will include operator consoles, HF radio transmission and reception equipment, RF matrices and antennas.  A FEMA Ethernet switch and router will provide Network Control Center (NECOS), Federal Regional Center (FRC) and Regional Office (RO) system connectivity to the FEMA Wide Area Network (WAN) and will permit remote operation and control of these networked HF radio systems by NECOS, FRC or RO locations.  Remote control and operation of HF radio systems will be accomplished using networked desktop or laptop computers. State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) HF radio equipment will not be connected to the FEMA WAN initially but will require local area network (LAN) remote operation and control.  However, EOC radio equipment installations must be accomplished with the understanding that FEMA WAN connections may be required at some later date. Split-site HF systems may be required at some locations.  In these cases, the transmitter and receiver will not be co-located.  Therefore, for effective ALE operation, it will be necessary that the receiver and exciter be capable of remotely communicating with and controlling one another.  In many cases a co-located transmitter and receiver (transceiver) will be required due to lack of funding or installation real estate for HF equipment and/or associated antennas. Ideally each FNARS installation will have a two (or multi-) radio configuration.  One HF system would be utilized for voice communications and another HF system would be utilized for email and messaging communications. This configuration would permit the exchange of both voice and data without interruption to either communications medium.  However, if a two radio installation is not possible due to either a lack of funding or real estate, an interface to preempt data traffic by higher priority voice traffic will be required. The HF radio equipment will include a Receiver/Exciter (for both combined and split systems), Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) and Link Quality Analysis (LQA), and will be adaptable to future Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) waveforms.  The systems will conform to Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), MIL-STD-188.110B and STANAG 5066.  The equipment will include the ability to process 39 tone HF waveforms to ensure backward compatibility and current mission interoperability.  The transmitter subsystems will be configured with 400W (or 500W), 1kW, and 4kW power amplification, depending upon station location, propagation requirements, network interoperability requirements, and special operations.  The exact configuration will be determined by site survey, and network configuration.  The 400/500W and 1kW systems must be contained in a single standard 72 inch high 19 inch wide rack but the 4kW systems may consist of two racks. At the Network Control Station (NECOS), FRC's and RO's, FNARS will use a modular, open system design to automatically operate and remotely control networked HF transmitter and receiver resources. This will include NECOS, FRC and RO systems at split site stations.  To achieve maximum flexibility the FNARS will use commercially available standards based operations, control and communications software and a multi-tasking operating system.  This will allow the station to operate "lights out" (unmanned) and to be economically controlled from a central location if necessary. It is a requirement that the HF radio equipment be capable of operating with KY-99A, KY-100, VP-116, DTD (AN/CYZ-10), and KIV-7 HSB communications security (COMSEC) equipment. The HF radio equipment manufacturer must also be capable of providing responsive technical support on site or via telephone on an "as needed" basis to either FEMA or SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston personnel.  The radios will available for use based on 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Technical support may be required at any time during the availability. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Firm -Fixed -Price (FFP) type contract. Period of performance will be one base year with four one-year options. The approximate value of the contract will be $25,000,000.00. Place of delivery will be to Government sites as directed by individual delivery orders.

<DESC>Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) herein known as the Contractor, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide the services described below to pre-qualified bidders only. To be deemed pre-qualified to bid on the RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to the "Pre-Qualification Criteria" section, Questions 1 through 9, addressing their specific areas of expertise and qualification.

Introduction

Work is currently underway to design and license a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. As part of these processes, modeling and analyses are carried out to design structures, systems, and components of the repository such that they will perform adequately under site specific seismic ground motion loads to ensure that operational (pre-closure) performance objectives are met. Modeling and analyses are also carried out to assess the performance of the repository after it is closed. As part of this assessment, the effect of seismic ground motions is included to ensure that post-closure performance objectives are met. To carry out the pre-closure and post-closure seismic modeling and analysis activities, it is required to develop ground motion inputs appropriate for the Yucca Mountain site. 

Summary Scope of Work:

The Subcontractor will be responsible for furnishing technical professional services to support the Contractor's seismic modeling and analyses activities for the Yucca Mountain Project located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This Scope has been deemed quality-affecting work. This work includes, but is not limited to, developing ground motion inputs to be used for the analysis and design of surface and subsurface structures, systems and components during the pre-closure operations period, and analysis for the post-closure performance assessment period. The work performed and results obtained shall be documented in new, or revisions to, existing technical reports, analysis and model reports, and/or scientific notebooks. The work also includes the maintenance and qualification of software needed to carry out modeling and analyses, as well as coordination and participation in geotechnical investigation activities to characterize the velocity and dynamic material properties of site materials for seismic modeling and analyses.

This work is necessary to support the Department of Energy's (DOE)'s pursuit for Construction Authorization in the following areas:


Geotechnical Investigation Activities:

- Support planning activities to determine appropriate geotechnical investigations to determine compression and shear wave velocities, and dynamic properties of site materials for seismic modeling and analysis activities.
- Support goetechnical investigations in the field to determine compression and shear wave velocities of site materials.
- Coordinate and lead an activity to synthesize new geotechnical information with existing data to develop, if warranted, (a) revised seismic velocity profiles for the repository block and for the surface facilities site and (b) revised dynamic material property curves. 

Pre-closure Design:

- Prepare new, or revise existing, design response spectra and time histories for mean annual exceedance frequencies of 1E-3 (Design Basis Ground Motion 1), 5E-4 (Design Basis Ground Motion 2), and 1E-4 (Beyond Design Basis Ground Motion). These three levels of seismic design inputs will be developed for one location at the subsurface emplacement level.
- Prepare new, or revise existing, design response spectra and time histories for mean annual exceedance frequencies of 1E-3 (Design Basis Ground Motion 1), 5E-4 (Design Basis Ground Motion 2), and 1E-4 (Beyond Design Basis Ground Motion). These three levels of seismic design inputs will be developed for the site of the surface facilities. 
- Prepare new, or revise existing, seismic design inputs consisting of strains, curvatures, and peak ground motion values, as a function of depth for annual exceedance frequencies of 1E-3 (Design Basis Ground Motion 1), 5E-4 (Design Basis Ground Motion 2), and 1E-4 (Beyond Design Basis Ground Motion). These three levels of seismic design inputs will be developed for the repository block.

Post-Closure Performance Assessment:

- Develop, or revise existing, peak ground velocity values and time histories for post-closure purposes for mean annual frequencies of exceedance of 1E-5, 1E-6, and 1E-7. Ground motion inputs for post-closure analyses will be developed for the subsurface emplacement level only.
- Document work performed and results in scientific notebooks and/or modeling and analyses reports.
- Carry out analyses to develop a bound to low frequency of exceedance ground motions at the emplacement level for Yucca Mountain.

Deliverables: 

- Submit all data to the Technical Data Management System.
- Document new geotechnical data and synthesis analyses in scientific notebooks or reports.  
- Revise Pre- and Post- closure reports as required.
- Prepare and submit report that supports modeling and analysis of bounding ground motion.
- Provide documentation to Software Maintenance and Qualification as required to support this effort.
- Submit records packages to BSC¡¦s Records Center.

Location of the Work:

Work shall be performed at Subcontractor's Facilities, however, all work documented will be submitted to the Contractor for review, comments and approval, unless otherwise directed by the Contractor.

Period of Performance:

The estimated RFP issuance date is March 2005. The anticipated planned date for award of the Technical Professional Services Subcontract is April 2005, with an expected duration through March 2006.

Subcontract Type:

It is anticipated that a fixed unit rate Technical Professional Services Subcontract will be awarded for this requirement; however, the Contractor reserves the right to negotiate separate task orders for work to be performed under the Subcontract with discrete deliverables.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for services involving the demonstration of alternatives to radioactive devices  technology, using FAR Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisition Procedures. RPD is dedicated to minimizing incidences of lost radioactive sources that enter into consumer metal supplies and the public domain. Industrial devices and consumer products containing radioactive sources routinely fall out of  regulatory control. Once this occurs, these devices and products may be subjected to harsh conditions capable of producing a breached source, with the potential of harmful exposure incidents and significant economical impacts to industry. Under the proposed Purchase Order, the Contractor will  demonstrate, implement and submit a final report for a  pilot project  that will result in the decreased use of radioactive sealed sources for industrial gauging purposes using technologies that are fully developed and validated in existing industrial processes without requiring significant  modifications to current manufacturing or inspection practices. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513, with a size standard of 500 employees. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   This is a sources sought notice for written information only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this sources sought notice or reimburse the costs incurred by potential offerors in providing the information requested herein. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (ORIA), Radiation Protection Division (RPD) is conducting market research to determine potential sources for services involving the demonstration of alternatives to radioactive devices  technology, using FAR Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisition Procedures. RPD is dedicated to minimizing incidences of lost radioactive sources that enter into consumer metal supplies and the public domain. Industrial devices and consumer products containing radioactive sources routinely fall out of  regulatory control. Once this occurs, these devices and products may be subjected to harsh conditions capable of producing a breached source, with the potential of harmful exposure incidents and significant economical impacts to industry. Under the proposed Purchase Order, the Contractor will  demonstrate, implement and submit a final report for a pilot project that will result in the decreased use of radioactive sealed sources for industrial gauging purposes using technologies that require further development for future implementation into existing manufacturing applications. The North  American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513, with a size standard of 500 employees. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested potential offerors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they plan  to meet the above requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Estimated dollar value is in the range of $5,000 ,000 to $10,000,000 and the completion period is 630 calendar days.  The NAICS code for this project is 237990.  Project is open to both large and small business.  If you are a large business and your bid or proposal will exceed $1 million, you will be req uired to submit a subcontracting plan with goals for small business (SB), historically underutilized business zone ( HUBZone), small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $28.5 million.  The Contract Award will be made using Competitive Proposal negotiation procedures for achieving the Best Value to the Government through the Source Selection (Tradeoff) Process, and will be made to the offeror whose Technical and Price Proposal combined, meets the Government's ne eds in the most effective, economical, and timely manner. The technical evaluation criteria factors to be used to determine the Best Value to the Government in the evaluation of Technical Proposals in descending order of importance are: Factor 1: Technical  Approach, Factor 2: Past Performance, Factor 3: Proposal Risk and Factor 4: Cost/Price.  In addition to the above Technical Proposal, a Price Proposal will be required to be submitted using the Price Schedule and other required forms provided in the Reque st for Proposal (RFP).  A Government Estimate will be prepared and will be used in the consideration of Price Proposals.  Price reasonableness that matches an offeror's technical approach is considered critical in the Government's Price Proposal considerat ion; however, award of a Contract will not be based solely on the lowest price proposal, significant, unexplained differences where proposed prices do not match a proposed technical approach and risk involved, may result in a Proposal being removed from th e Competitive Range. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions with all of the offerors within the Competitive Range. The Government also reserves the right to Award a Contract without discussions.  All technical evaluation criteria Factors other than Price when combined are significantly more important than Price.  After the Government evaluates the Technical and Price Proposals received, the Contracting Officer will determine a Competitive Range.  The Competitive Range will consist of all o f the most highly rated Proposals against all technical evaluation criteria factors and Prices proposed. The Contracting Officer may limit the number of Proposals in the Competitive Range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amo ng the most highly rated Proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation but rather a market survey to determine potential sources. The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Global Information Grid Systems Group, Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) Program Office (GIGSG/MC) is seeking a qualified contractor for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), to include both hardware and software, for the Defense Injection/Reception Emergency Action Message Command and Control Terminal (DIRECT) for FY06 with options for FY07 through FY10.  DIRECT was developed, produced, and installed by General Dynamics C4 Systems (formerly GTE Government Systems), Needham, MA, under contract F19628-96-C-0126.  General Dynamics is currently providing CLS under contract F19628-01-C-0053.  Seven systems are currently installed in Nuclear Combatant Commander command centers at NMCC, NMCC Site R, USJFCOM, USSTRATCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USEUCOM.  An additional system resides at General Dynamics as a development/test and sustainment system.  DIRECT consists of both commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment and equipment designed and built by General Dynamics.  DIRECT utilizes a two-level maintenance concept--organizational and depot.  Organizational level hardware maintenance will be performed by contractor on-site technicians in TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI facilities and will consist of system restoration by fault verification/isolation, removal/replacement of the faulty Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and functional checkout using existing technical manuals and other technical data.  Potential sources must provide appropriately cleared maintenance technicians at each site which can be utilized on an on-call-as-required basis to support DIRECT.  For newly designed equipment, depot level hardware maintenance will consist of diagnostic analysis, using contractor-provided common support equipment, of returned LRUs to isolate faulty Shop Replaceable Units (SRUs), the removal and replacement of faulty SRUs, and functional checkout.  SRUs in most instances will consist of circuit cards, power supplies, or fiber optics transmitters/receivers. The CLS contractor will determine the most cost-effective means of repair for each COTS hardware item consistent with meeting required system performance criteria and availability of commercial technical data.  A commercial drawing package, an organizational level maintenance manual, and depot troubleshooting procedures for General Dynamics-designed LRUs are available.  Two DIRECT Engineering Development Model (EDM) systems, one production system, and two Message Generator/Receivers will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  No other peculiar depot test equipment or test program sets are available.  Software maintenance will consist of periodic updates (estimated two per year) to implement changes to OPSPLAN 8044 templates and values as well as to correct other problems and incorporate enhancements.  Software maintenance must take place in a TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI environment with appropriately cleared personnel. Potential sources must have an appropriate security-certified software development facility available, including hardware and software tools required to incorporate, test, and manage software changes.  To be considered qualified for this effort, potential sources must have detailed knowledge and experience in the following areas: (1) understanding of nuclear C3 systems; (2) command center operations for command and control of nuclear weapons in accordance with EAP-CJCS Vols. I, II, V, and VII; (3) automated interface to strategic and tactical EAM dissemination communications systems; (4) implementation of information system security IAW DOD S5200.16, DODD 5200.28, and CJCSI 3231.01; (5) system-level communications testing;  (6) contract planning and management; and (7) immediate access to TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI facilities and immediate availability of TOP SECRET/OPSPLAN 8044-ESI cleared personnel to work on this project.  Respondents must provide detailed information in a qualification package of no more than ten double-spaced, single-sided pages.  All small business and disadvantaged sources should identify themselves as such.  Potential sources will be evaluated and determined qualified/unqualified based on the seven areas listed above.  Each respondent will be advised in writing of the results of this evaluation.  Any firm initially judged to be unqualified will be provided a copy of the solicitation upon request, and any firm submitting an offer will be evaluated without prejudice.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited.  For questions concerning DIRECT, contact 1Lt Eve McCloud, DIRECT Program Manager, at (781) 377-8073, fax (781) 377-8893, e-mail eve.mccloud@hanscom.af.mil.

<DESC>This DOE Tri-Lab community (Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory) deployed a high bandwidth Wide Area Network (DisCom WAN) about five years ago to implement a distance computing strategy.  This strategy allowed users at any one of the three laboratories to utilize ASC (Advanced Simulation and Computing) resources at the other sites in a manner similar to that provided for local users.  The current contract providing the 2.5 Gbps (Gigabits per second) interconnect between SNL, NM and LLNL, CA is due to expire on January 31, 2006.  That capability must be replaced in order to continue support for the ASC distance computing strategy.  

Many technological advances and changes have taken place since the original bandwidth contract was placed.  In order to replace the existing service and maintain our network performance, we must understand the technological and market changes that have taken place as well as the deployment strategies of the telecommunication carriers, or any organization that aspires to provide such capabilities.  We are soliciting input from industry for the technical requirements, availability, schedule, and the cost of a 2.5 Gbps and higher, production WAN link from SNL to LLNL.  It must be implemented by January 31, 2006 with a lifetime of at least three years.  Therefore, we strongly encourage interested providers to share their near- and long-term strategy for long distance, bandwidth services of 2.5 Gbps and above. 

The full Request for Information (RFI) document is available on request in .doc (Microsoft Word) format.

<DESC>Project DC PLH-14(3) consists of correcting signage deficiencies on Interstate 395 (I-395), between the DC Jurisdictional Line on the 14th Street Bridge and New York Avenue, Washington, DC.  The primary project limits on I-395 in the 14th Street Bridge Corridor extend from the DC Jurisdictional line to Maine Avenue; and consists of installation, modification, removal and replacement of traffic signs (roadside and overhead), cantilever sign structures, and overhead sign bridges to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD for enhancing the safety of the traveling public.  Electrical connections, including conduit and wiring, will be needed at all new sign structure locations.  The secondary project limits on I-395 extend from Maine Avenue to New York Avenue and addresses over-height vehicle signing, for vehicles approaching and traveling in the National Mall tunnel.  Again these signs are proposed to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD.  Traffic control will be very important during construction of this project, and will most likely include night work.

<DESC>Request for Information – Laboratory and Medical Supplies/Equipment

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is implementing a strategic sourcing program to increase efficiencies and drive savings across its operating and staff divisions.  As part of this strategic sourcing initiative, a Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to aid in the identification of firms who have the capabilities to provide Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment to DHHS.  DHHS plans to acquire these Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment from current General Services Administration (GSA) Medical Equipment and Supplies, Invitro Diagnostics, Reagents, Test Kits/Test Sets, and Chemistry, Biochemistry, Clinical Instruments, General Purpose Laboratory Instruments and Services Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) holders.  To respond to this RFI, a firm must hold a current FSS that includes Special Item Numbers 65 II A, 66 II N, and 65 VII. 

This RFI seeks information from FSS holders that can demonstrate that they have the resources and capabilities to best support all or part of this requirement.  Given the complexity and size of this requirement, DHHS strongly encourages small business participation either individually or as a joint venture team, consortium, or similar arrangement. DHHS will use the information obtained from this RFI and other market research techniques to identify GSA FSS holders who possess the capability, either solely or through a subcontract/teaming arrangement, to provide the required Laboratory & Medical Supplies/Equipment to the broad range of geographically dispersed DHHS organizations.  

For more information, please review the synopsis in full and the attached RFI documents (Excel workbook).

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information; it is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of flight control computers to replace the existing computers in the E-2C and C-2A Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCS).  The replacement Digital Flight Control Computer (DFCC) is intended to reduce aircraft operating costs, increase reliability and maintainability, improve airplane flying qualities, and provide growth capability for future performance enhancements.   A U.S. Navy integration team will lead the effort to install the replacement DFCC into the E-2 and C-2 aircraft. Upgrades to current flight control computers as well as Non-Developmental replacement computers will be considered.

Pending future funding allocations, specific DFCC functional requirements will be defined.  For purposes of this initial market request for information, prospective vendors should consider the following general performance requirements:  The replacement DFCC shall operate in a carrier-based aircraft environment with an MTBF exceeding 5000 hours.  The DFCC shall be a form and fit replacement of the existing computer, interfacing with the existing flight control sensors and actuators.  The DFCC shall provide airplane flying qualities improvements and growth capability for future performance enhancements, to include integrated navigation system functions. The DFCC shall provide a Continuous Built-In Test (CBIT) to detect and isolate in-flight faults within the DFCC and, in other AFCS WRAs where practical.  In order to minimize single-point failures within the AFCS, a DFCC with redundant computing channels and fault isolation paths is preferred.  Consideration shall be given to using other existing sources of sensor data to further enhance CBIT effectiveness.  The DFCC shall also provide an IBIT to demonstrate the operational readiness of the DFCC and other AFCS WRAs, where practical.  IBIT shall provide the maintainer with adequate information to identify the faulty WRA, or where ambiguous, the faulty WRA or wire group.

This program is currently unfunded. Future program funding status is to be determined, and may include one, or both aircraft types.   However, the replacement DFCC shall be common to both the E-2 and C-2 aircraft.  In addition, the replacement DFCC shall ensure a positive return on investment when compared to total ownership cost of the current systems.  The U.S. Navy E-2 inventory is currently 69 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through 2035.  The U.S. Navy C-2 inventory currently consists of 35 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through 2017.

The E-2/C-2 Program Office will consider alternative funding sources for this program. Some of those sources, but not necessarily all, will include applications to the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) LECP program, similar programs sponsored by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the OSD Reduction in Total Ownership Costs program, the NAVAIR Cost Wise Readiness Initiative program (CWRI), and the Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program. Information contained in responses to this RFI may be used to support any, all or other program initiatives. 

Responses to this RFI should include: 1.) A summary outline of the performance specifications of the replacement DFCC; 2.) A short description of the hardware and software changes which may be required to meet E-2 and C-2 unique aircraft interfaces;  3.) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of vendor non-recurring costs; 4.) A ROM estimate of DFCC unit costs; and,  5.) Any other information at vendor discretion, but limited to 5 printed pages.  To the maximum extent possible, estimated E-2 and C-2 costs should be separated.

<SUBJECT>Increase of Ceiling to Common Shipboard Data Terminal Set (CSDTS) Contract N00039-02-D-2106
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to increase the ceiling of the Common Shipboard Data Terminal Set (CSDTS) contract N00039-02-D-2106 with DRS Communications Company, LLC, 1200 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, PA 19038 by $6 million. The proposed contract modification will require the contractor to engineer, manufacture, test and deliver CSDTS systems. The CSDTS system being procured under this contract is the next generation of Data Terminal Set product improvements that will provide LINK-11 single tone waveform, a transmission capability between the RF media and the satellite medium.  The CSDTS also improves upon older terminal set technology by adding multi-frequency transmissions, Dual Net Link 11, Joint Range Extension (JRE) and Link 22 capabilities.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for the CSDTS ceiling increase would incur substantial duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration knowledge of the CSDTS which would not be recovered through competition.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice of intent to increase the ceiling of the existing CSDTS contract to DRS Communications Company, LLC should be submitted within forty-five (45) days from the date of this synopsis to Ms. Kelly Smith, Contract Specialist, at Contracts, Code 02-21L, Building OT4, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, CA 92110-3127. For information regarding this notice, please contact Ms. Kelly Smith at (619) 524-7351. This requirement will be procured in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>R--A-76 Cost Comparison Study
<DESC>This public announcement is being issued as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised), dated May 29, 2003.  The U.S. Department of Transportation/Maritime Administration (MARAD) announces that it intends to conduct an A-76 streamlined competition to determine whether the work described below in support of various MARAD Headquarters offices will be performed by Federal Government employees or by a private sector source.  MARAD intends to conduct this acquisition following the streamlined competition procedures as outlined in the OMB Circular A-76.  In accordance with procedures for a streamlined competition described in the circular, the  performance decision will be based on a comparison of the cost of performance between an estimate of private sector costs  and the cost of in-house performance by civil service employees that is based on a most efficient organization (MEO) design.  Further, the intent is to make one award to a single service provider who will be responsible for providing all of the services under study.  MARAD does not intend to make separate awards for each service or service area under study.  The agency expects to complete this competition within 135 calendars days of this announcement.  In general, the service areas being competed primarily involve administrative support functions, as well as certain aspects of human resources support and supply functions in support of specific management and program offices located at MARAD Headquarters in the Nassif Building, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC 20590.  Approximately 31 civil service full time equivalent (FTE) positions are currently performing these selected services.  There are no incumbent contractors currently performing these services in the impacted Headquarters offices.  As required by the Circular, the following additional information is provided.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) for the Agency is Richard Weaver.  The Agency Tender Official (ATO) is Eileen Roberson.  The Contracting Officer (CO) and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) is Wayne Leong.

Draft evaluation criteria will be posted at a later date.  Be advised, Statement of Work changes are possible when the final RFP is released and hard copies are not available.  

Any and all comments are welcome.  Some of the areas AFOSR is looking for comments on include:

Are the service requirements clear and understandable?

<SUBJECT>R -- Industry Day - Creating an Integrated Ocean Observing System
<DESC>OFFICE OF OCEAN.US INTEGRATED OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM (IOOS) INDUSTRY DAY  Office of Ocean.US, 2300 Clarendon Blvd., Arlington, VA 22217-5660 

CONTACT:  Andrew M. Clark, Industry Liaison for Ocean.US
(703) 588-0846;  aclark@ocean.us

DESCRIPTION:  The Office of Ocean.US (Ocean.US) announces a briefing for interested organizations concerning plans to design, develop, fabricate, install and operate the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).  The IOOS is in the exploratory planning phase and all interested parties are invited to provide input, ideas, concepts and suggestions toward ensuring its effective development.  Ocean.US is an interagency program office (www.ocean.us) established to develop the IOOS.
The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is intended to be a “user-driven” integrated network to include ocean observatories, data telemetry, data management and communication, systems and data analysis and modeling tools that reliably and continuously provide the data and information that is required to achieve the seven IOOS societal goals:
(1) Improve predictions of climate change and weather and their effects on coastal communities and the nation;
(2) Improve the safety and efficiency of marine operations; 
(3) More effectively mitigate the effects of natural hazards; 
(4) Improve national and homeland security;
(5) Reduce public health risks; 
(6) More effectively protect and restore healthy coastal marine ecosystems; and 
(7) Enable the sustained use of marine resources.
The IOOS is intended to become a national asset. IOOS may be characterized as a “network centric, system-of-systems”. This large scale network will incorporate oceanographic, meteorological and atmospheric sensors offshore and onshore, sub sea and at sea surface, the equipment and telemetry methods to transmit this data first to shore and then through a national terrestrial network.  Central to the IOOS will be an information system (IS) that includes the hardware, software, middleware and storage capacity to collect, analyze, archive, distribute and disseminate the IOOS data.  It is intended that portals will be developed to allow contributors around the nation to input their data and that the data will be made available through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in order that users in the private sector, academia and the government may access it.  It is the goal of Ocean.US to completely characterize all components required to address these goals and solicit from industry input and best commercial practices that will help to achieve them.  The industry brief will be held at the Hall of Flags, at the US Chamber of Commerce Bldg. located near the White House at 1615 H street NW, Washington, D.C., 20062-2000  Admission is controlled and the material to be presented at the IOOS  industry brief will be unclassified.  To attend this event, register online at www.oceanusmeeting.com. Phone or fax requests for registration material can be made to: Mr. Gil Donohue, PH: 703-442-7727; FX: 703-442-8199. Include names of all attendees (3 maximum). Attendance is limited to three per company/organization.  Suggested attendees: Senior Technologist, Business Development, and Government Relations.    Upon receipt of the completed IOOS Registration Package, potential attendees will receive a confirmation notice and other relevant information. Interested parties are reminded that no one will be admitted to the industry brief without this confirmation. Requests to attend this briefing must be received no later than 1600 EDT Friday 11 March 2005. Only individuals who have submitted their registration and clearance information by 1600 EDT on 11 March 2005 and have received approval will be allowed to attend the IOOS Industry Day on 18 March 2005.

<SUBJECT>70 -- COTS solution to improve accuracy and efficiency of selecting and classifying products and services when creating electronic purchase requisitions
<DESC>The United States Postal Service is seeking sources for a robust, best-in-class COTS solution to improve the accuracy and efficiency of selecting and classifying products and services when creating electronic purchase requisitions.  USPS has implemented the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code ® (UNSPSC®) to classify commodities, route requisitions to the appropriate Category Management Center, and improve enterprise visibility of spend.  The preferred solution will use product or services descriptions or nomenclature entered by the requestor to facilitate the selection of the correct UNSPSC with a high degree of accuracy.  The preferred solution will allow 4 levels of UNSPSC to be entered into the electronic requisitioning system (e-Buy).  A best-in-class solution will also integrate a learning algorithm to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the UNSPSC selection process over time.   No solicitation is available.  This synopsis if for informational purposes only.

<DESC>In 2004, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest advertised and awarded three multiple year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for Architect/Engineering Services for Mine Site Remediation, Hazardous Waste Identification and Removal Actions and related work.  The number of originally awarded contracts is sufficient for current projects to be awarded.  However, preliminary workload estimates of projects worth more than four million dollars for the coming year(s) indicate a need for one additional contractor.  Therefore, this solicitation will result in the award of one additional contract. 

Architect/Engineering Services for Mine Site Remediation, including Hazardous Waste Identification and Removal Actions.  Work includes Preliminary Assessments, Site Inspections, Engineering Evaluations/Cost Analyses, Removal Actions, and related work for mines on Forest Service lands in Oregon and Washington.  Work is to be done in conformance with all State and Federal Regulations and guidelines and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “Guidance for Performing Site Inspections Under CERCLA,” EPA “Sampling QA/QC Plan and Data Validation Procedures,” Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), National Contingency Plan (NCP) as outlined in 40 CFR, Parts 300.410, Removal Site Evaluation, (c-i-iv) and 300.415 Removal action, (2) (i-viii).  Other Guidelines, such as NOAA, Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL), EPA Preliminary Remediation Goals (PRGs) also apply.  The more stringent regulations will be used per EO 12580.

Engineer and Geologist of record shall be a professional engineer/geologist licensed in the state where the project site(s) are located and with technical expertise in the area of emphasis appropriate for the work.  An engineer with Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) experience and registered within the state where the work is being performed is required and must be a key element in the organization, not just a referenced source.  This specialty must have a minimum of 5 years experience with Forest Service or BLM related projects with specific experience in all aspects of the CERCLA process, which include:  Abbreviated Preliminary Assessments (APA), Site Inspections (SI), Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analyses (EE/CA), Removal Designs and Removal Actions (RD/RA) and Monitoring.  EPA experience is not relevant as EPA procedures are different from Forest Service procedures.  Forest Service does not use the EPA HRS system for ranking of mines.

Evaluation criteria include: (1) Experience and qualifications of key personnel, including subcontractors and laboratories.  (2)  Specialized experience and technical competence. All key personnel involved with these projects, including team leaders, must have a minimum of 5 years experience with mine type projects associated with Forest Service and BLM, which includes education and work experience in all aspects of this work:  APA, SI, EE/CA, RD/RA and Monitoring.  For example, performing water monitoring activities for a chemical plant is not the same as performing water monitoring for abandoned mines.  All experience must be specifically associated with mines, whether active or inactive.  EPA experience is not relevant and therefore will not be rated as highly as Forest Service or BLM experience.  Furthermore, all key personnel and team leaders must have related education experience for the work being conducted, regardless of title within the organization.  All key disciplines must be licensed in the appropriate state where such licensing is required.  Offerors must provide a minimum of 5 project examples specific to mines and mine reclamation for all key personnel and team leaders.  Work experience with coal mines or EPA will not be considered relevant experience.  Must have at least one key person who has education as well as field experience in active/inactive mine exploration, processing and assessment. (3)  Geographic location, as it relates to ability to reach mine sites in a timely manner and familiarity with local types of mines, (4) Capacity to accomplish the work and (5) Record of Past Performance.

Project locations are on or near National Forests in both eastern and western Washington and Oregon states.  The Government anticipates that only one award will be made from this solicitation, which will result in a 2 year contract.  Contractor awarded a contract under this solicitation is not guaranteed award of any task orders; contractor is instead guaranteed an opportunity to compete for projects, as described in this solicitation:  Forest Service mine reclamation work in Region 6 (Washington and Oregon) to be contracted out will be competed as task orders among holders of this contract.  Competition among contract holders will follow standard A&E procedures.

Submit SF 330 to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 10600 NE 51st Circle, Vancouver, Washington 98682; attn:  Yvonne J Sterud.  Key Personnel listed in the SF 330 will be incorporated into the awarded contract.  Substitution of key personnel will not be allowed without Contracting Officer approval.  Electronic offers are acceptable but must be in PDF format and cannot exceed 5 megabytes; one hard copy with original signatures is also required.  Offers not submitted electronically must include 3 compact disk copies of the offer.  Deadline for receipt of all proposals (both electronic and hard copy) is close of business, March 17, 2005.  This is a 100% set-aside for Small Business.

NOTE:  Mining experience with Bureau of Mines or mining industry is also acceptable.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment #002  to HSHQDA-05-Q-0011 is to:

a.	Add the following:  

Date and time specified for receipts of quotes is extended until February 16, 2005 at 4:00 pm CST.

Inquiries / information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this particular acquisition.

All vendors submitting quotes in response to this solicitation shall include brochures, drawings and layout on products being quoted, or they will be determined to be non-responsive.

Installation and Freight cost shall be included as part of your quote or it will be determined to be non-responsive. 

b.	Response to additional questions and comments.    


1.  Recessing the monitors 3-4" will not improve the line of sight by much if the operators need to either see each other or see something over and/or behind the monitor.  We can do this if this is what they really want.  Alternative ways to accommodate the monitors are:  a) Mounted to an articulating arm so that the monitor may be moved out of the way if necessary; or b) Recessing the monitor completely below the work surface.
 
Response: We have addressed this in the overall design of the Operations Center Plan. Recessing the monitor 3-4" is acceptable. 
 
2.  What is the purpose of the "hutch" on the Administrative Desk?  See question/answer #1.  It was my impression that they wanted a free standing storage unit.  Or would they consider an enclosure for the monitors; or a slatwall?
 
Response: There is a free standing storage unit in the Radio Room.  The "hutch" is a separate unit over the Administrative Desk.
 
3.  Re:  The two "workstations" (shown on their drawing with 4 chairs each - 4 operator stations each); my understanding is that they will have flat panel monitors on two of the four modules, and that the remaining two modules should be available for use with laptop computers and therefore be supplied with a Power Port.  Is this correct?
 
Response:  All of these workstations will have a flat panel monitor

4. Can you please tell me the dimensions on the flat screen monitors and keyboards. The monitor handling set-up we will probably use has a built in under the work surface keyboard tray.  Will you need room for a keyboard and a mouse?
 
Response:  Dimensions of the flat screen monitor is 15 inches x 13 inches; Keyboard is 17 ½ inches x 7 inches and we do need room for keyboard and mouse.

5.  Please provide more precision on the following:
     a.  Depth of the Credenza 20 or 24 inches.
     b.  Depth  and size of the recessed shelf for flat screen monitor.

Response:  a: 20 inches   b:  accommodate 15 inch flat screen monitor

6.	Can we have more Information on the Docking Station Cradle? 

Response:  Cradle should accommodate Dell Laptop D400 & docking station.
