<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole-source follow-on contract to FiberGate, Inc. for the continued lease/maintenance of sixty-three (63) FiberGate owned fiber optic cable segments currently linking various Centers and Offices of the FDA.  The cable segments are primarily in the Rockville, Maryland, area, but three (3) of those cables are to locations outside of Rockville:  to FDA’s White Oak campus, to the FDA building in College Park, Maryland, and to the Hubert Humphrey Building in the District of Columbia.   FDA paid Fibergate a substantial sum for the installation of (these) cables under the previous contract.   Replacing Fibergate with another contractor who would install its own cables would create a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered by competition, and would also create an unacceptable delay in contract performance.  The anticipated period of performance will be 60 months (5 years) with a 12 month base year, and 4 option years.

<DESC>USAID intends to modify existing Road Rehabilitation Project (RRP) Phase III Indefinite Quantity Contracts as identified below to include additional road rehabilitation:
        Contract # 294-I-00-05-00210-00
                   294-I-00-05-00211-00

                   294-I-00-05-00213-00
Under this initiative, USAID will continue the construction and rehabilitation of selected priority road segments in the West Bank and Gaza in cooperation with Palestinian authorities. This project is part of the U.S. led effort to support the Road Map for Peace in the Middle East. The restoration of roads will improve access to markets, improve the movement of labor and goods, and support Palestinian construction industry. 

The proposed action will provide for added road construction for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate only with the four contractors currently under contract for this effort under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5). This provision waives full and open competition for services when the competitive process would result in substantial additional costs to the Government and in unacceptable delays. USAID has highly evaluated these four current contractor’s performance whose specific continuance of the current required work is imperative to the immediate needs of the Palestinian people. A new competitive procurement would result in substantial additional costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling these needs. Therefore, it is the intent of the Government that this procurement be conducted only with pre-qualified contractors presently under contract for the RRP Phase III. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested firms, however, may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. All responses received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government's determination to compete, or not to compete, the proposed work efforts based upon expressions of interest from other firms responding to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received in expressions of interested will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Denver Service Center, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, Colorado 80225 anticipates awarding a firm-fixed price design-build contract based upon a two-phase selection procedure. This notice represents solicitation of qualification statements as Phase One of the two-phased selection approach. The scope of work includes design and construction of a new visitor services facility (visitor center), redesign and reducing the size of an existing parking area (former ski area parking lot), and associated utility connections.  The new visitor facility will be approximately 8000 square feet (gross), single-story construction, located on a portion of the existing parking area to be removed.  The landscape around the building will be re-graded to mimic more natural contours.  Erosion control and hydro-seeding will be needed, but all re-vegetation planting will be designed and installed by the government. The visitor facility will include a front desk/lobby area, exhibit space, A/V room (w/flat floor), restrooms, a concessioner-operated kitchen and dining area, office spaces, and utility rooms.  Coordination with an NPS exhibit designer is required, but exhibit design, fabrication, and installation will be done by others.  The facility will be heated by propane-fired boilers and cooled by natural outside ventilation (no air conditioning). Site work includes reducing an oversize parking lot (demo of about 40,000 sf), grading, new walks, and signs.  Utility work includes typical connections to utilities available at the site and installation of approximately 1,300 linear feet of 10" water line to connect the new facility to an existing water storage tank. The contractor's facility design will be based the NPS Schematic Design for the facility, which will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposals (Phase 2). Contractor recommendations for creative cost saving and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase 2 process. The estimated price is between $7,000,000 and $9,000,000, including all design and construction services, with the construction portion to be completed no later than September, 2008. The contract provides for preparation of design development and construction documents, utility connections, site work, and the visitor center building. Funding has been secured for this project. Construction for portions of the project (such as utilities or earthwork) may be allowed to begin prior to completion of the final building construction documents, provided construction documents for those specific portions have been reviewed and accepted for contract completeness.  Design submittals for all portions of the work will be required prior to construction.  Record drawings will also be required upon construction completion. All design-build firms have 30 days from the date of this notice to provide qualifications for evaluation based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance: 1. past performance, demonstrating quality of work, professional expertise, technical competence, and ability to effectively schedule and manage a multi-disciplinary work force, 2. extent of design/build experience, especially experience that the offerer's current A/E/construction company partnership has working together, 3. demonstrated ability to provide innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis on Green Building and sustainable methods and technologies, and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost, 4. experience with projects of a type and scope similar to that of this project, which includes heavy snow country design and construction and a winter shutdown period, and 5. experience working in remote areas with environmentally sensitive resources. Design-build firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit a Standard Form 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated above for Phase One evaluation. The SF 330's are formatted for architect-engineer and related services but this form will be used for both design and construction qualifications. The SF 330 can be downloaded from the forms library section at following website:  http://www.gsa.gov. Only hard copy responses received by 3:45 P.M. LOCAL TIME ON MARCH 20, 2006, will be evaluated further. Up to five of the most highly qualified design-build firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this design-build selection process. In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the National Park Service Schematic Design, performance specifications, and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals. Offerors will be required to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposals.  The RFP will not require new design drawings as part of the Phase Two submittal.  A price proposal will be required along with the technical and management proposals. Each short-listed offeror will be required to submit both a technical and price proposal within 45 days after the RFP is issued based upon evaluation factors identified in the RFP. A stipend fee of $10,000 will be awarded to each offeror that provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal under Phase Two of this selection process. Award of a single contract will be made to the "best value" offeror by approximately July 15, 2006. Debriefings will be made available after contract award. Because this acquisition would result in an award over $1,000,000, the final selected firm will be required to submit a subcontracting plan, if the firm is a large business concern. For inquiries and clarifications, the primary point of contact is Lori Irish, Contracting Officer, telephone number (303) 987-6776, email lori_irish@nps.gov.  The alternate point of contact is Joy Jamison, Contract Specialist, telephone number (303) 969-2170, email joy_jamison@nps.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Note: this is not an RFP.  All responsible sources may submit responses for consideration.  Responses to this request for qualifications must be received in writing by 3:30 P.M. MST on MARCH 20, 2006.  No telephone calls for solicitations will be accepted. Note:  Architectural/engineering (A/E) firms that were involved in the preparation of the final schematic design and performance specifications for this project are not eligible to participate in the subsequent design-build process.

<DESC>Description
1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement to Build three Frames to support three Fuselages for a KC135 BOWST Trainer in accordance with attached Statement of Work and drawings.(Additional drawings available upon request.)     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number F3P3BD6004A100.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 238130; size standard $12,000,000.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.     (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.     The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.     The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.     Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.     The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide potential respondents additional insight into how the Government intends to assess responses to the Sources Sought for an aircraft weapons systems level Performance Based Logistics (PBL) concept for the V-22 platform.  In general terms, the assessment of submissions will be based on how well contractors address the following areas (the assessment however is not limited to just these areas): a) experience (Commercial or Government) in systems-level performance based logistics, b) experience (Commercial or Government) in component-level performance based logistics; c) understanding of supply chain management; and d) understanding of engineering support.  A notional concept for V-22 PBL while desired, is not required as part of a response to the Sources Sought request.  In addition, the Government desires that all respondents identify any issues/concerns they have that are unique to implementing a systems-level PBL on the V-22 platform. This Sources Sought is being conducted to assist the Government in developing an acquisition strategy to fulfill the V-22 Joint PBL requirement.  No contracts will be awarded based on the Sources Sought responses. The Government anticipates at some yet undetermined point in the future that an RFP for the V-22 Joint PBL requirement will be issued.  Whether this future RFP will be released on a sole-source or a competitive basis has not been determined.  No time extensions will be granted for Sources Sought submissions as a result of this notice.

<DESC>This is Modification 4 to the synopsis entitled TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR NASA KSC TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICE, which was posted on February 2, 2006. You are notified that Technology Area 8 entitled "Leak Detection System for Space Equipment” is hereby added:  “7) Leak Detection System for Space Equipment NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and field testing of a prototype leak-detection scheme for use in space environments.  The leak-detection system must work in space and detect leaks from outside the vehicle.  The leak-detection system must detect any type of gas, such as refrigerants, propellants, and cabin air.    Background: The International Space Station (ISS) has had multiple issues arising from leaks.	The current protocol for detecting leaks on the ISS is to close each of the modules one by one, and then determine which module has a leak by the subsequent change in air cabin pressure.	 This is a laborious and time consuming process.    As NASA's exploration plans are formulated, leak detection in space will be vital for successful missions.  Leakage of refrigerants, propellants or cabin air can cause life threatening situations. Qualifying partners must have experience in Leak Detection Instrumentation and Aerospace Equipment Manufacturing.” ***************************************************************************************** *****************************************  The due date for responses remains unchanged as February 24, 2006.  Documents related to this teaming opportunity will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/KSC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of any further modifications to this synopsis.

   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: March 17, 2006
4. POSITION TITLE: Senior Rule of Law Advisor – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 91,507 - $ 118,957 per annum (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: August 2006 –   August  2008
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:
A. Basic Function of the position: 

The framework for the rule of law in Kosovo has been disrupted since 1989 when the Serb-dominated government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia took a series of actions to systematically exclude the ethnic Albanian majority from participation in the legal system and pursued a campaign of ethnic cleansing.   At the end of the conflict in 1999, the remains of the judicial system and the rule of law such as it existed in Kosovo collapsed, as the largely Serb judiciary and police fled, legal documentation was destroyed, and physical infrastructure was damaged.
 
The end of the conflict saw the emergence of an international consensus, codified in UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for a UN-led administration for Kosovo.  KFOR, an international force organized through NATO, provides peacekeeping.  An international police force (CIVPOL) is also operative, though a new local force (KPS) has assumed much of the responsibility for law enforcement.  Other leading players participating in the establishment of a new civil administration include the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is responsible under the UN umbrella for democratization and institution-building (including judicial system development); the European Union; and a host of bilateral donors including the United States.
During years since 1999, United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) has set in place the basic legal and administrative framework for a new judicial system in Kosovo. Today, the justice sector is in transition as competencies are transferred from the UNMIK Department of Justice (DOJ) to the nascent PISG Ministry of Justice (MOJ) representing the executive branch of government, and Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) which is establishing the basis for an independent judiciary.  
Support for the development of rule of law and an independent and effective judiciary is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo, including accountable and transparent governance (SO. 2.1), and establishment of an institutional framework for economic growth and expansion (SO 1.3).
 U.S. assistance for support of the judicial system has taken a number of forms.  In the post-conflict period, USAID has funded the following activities: 
1) The American Bar Association’s Central and East European Law Initiative (ABA/CEELI) has supported immediate legal training requirements, the formation and development of the Judges’ and bar associations, legislative analysis and drafting.  
2) The US National Center for State Courts (NCSC) and DPK Consulting have developed improved systems for court administration in fields such as personnel, accounting, procurement, and budgeting, and are currently providing further support for implementing the systems.  
3) The International Development Law Institute (IDLI) has begun assessing the practical skills training needs of judges and prosecutors, in preparation for a year long training program in conjunction with the Kosovo Judicial Institute.  
4) Partners for Democratic Change International (PDCI) have developed a mediation center and training program.  
5) USAID’s institutional contractor in support of economic restructuring has provided extensive support for the modernization of economic and commercial law, and will continue to do so.  
The State Department’s Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL) has provided basic commodities for the courts system - primarily vehicles, generators, and computers. The U.S. Department of Justice has placed a number of legal advisor in the U.S. Office Pristina (USOP), working primarily on criminal law and training of prosecutors.
 STATEMENT OF WORK:
1.    General:

The Senior Rule of Law Advisor (SROLA) will serve as the focal point for all Rule of Law activities in USAID/Kosovo’s portfolio.  He/She will be responsible for: coordinating and integrating all USAID Rule of Law reform activities  for ensuring that all Mission justice sector activities are coordinated with other U.S. government agencies; and for ensuring that the design and implementation of all USAID rule of law activities are fully coordinated with the relevant branches of the Kosovar PISG, international organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors active in Rule of Law assistance activities.

<DESC>Tahoe Yellow Cress FBO Announcement


The Tahoe National Forest anticipates awarding a non-competitive contract to BMP Ecosciences for the continuation of the implementation of the Conservation Strategy for the Tahoe Yellow Cress (Rorippa subumbellata) (Pavlik et al. 2002) for the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the U.S. Forest Service.  The strategy outlines goals and objectives intended to facilitate recovery of Tahoe yellow cress, improve populations, and guide management and conservation activities to secure its survival into the future and to prevent the need to list the species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and allow the States of Nevada and California to downlist or delist this species under their respective endangered species acts.
The program of work is a continuation of activities performed by BMP Ecosciences that commenced in 2000 with the drafting of the strategy, followed by implementation in 2003, which included collection of seed, oversight of nursery activities (propagation and maintenance), experimental design and implementation of mitigation studies, continued implementation and monitoring of outplanting/translocation studies, continued water relations study, development of a survey protocol that will detect a sustainable metapopulation dynamic, and fulfilling reporting requirements as specified under the strategy.  Implementation is expected to continue through 2010.
The key management questions and research and adaptive management framework for Tahoe yellow cress were also developed by BMP Ecosciences.  They have provided the necessary scientific expertise for the experimental design and implementation of statistically robust studies on the ground.  
Vendors believing they can meet this requirement must submit written information showing clearly that they are able to meet the requirements stated above.  All information must be received no later than 2 pm PST, April 3, 2006.  Mail to Tahoe National Forest, 631 Coyote Street, Nevada City, CA  95959, Attn:  Contracting, or FAX to (530) 478-6126. See numbered note 22.

No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of a response to this notice.  

DUE: Written responses to this sources sought synopsis should be submitted no later than (15) fifteen calendar days from the publication date of this notice.

Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Oren Edwards, phone (937) 255-7210 x3901, email: oren.edwards@wpafb.af.mil

DESC:  Sources sought for UAI Contracts, POC: Ms Pamela Bates, CONTRACT NEGOTIATOR, phone: (937) 255-3385 ext. 3109, email: Pamela.bates@wpafb.af.mil, Mr. Larry Doelker, CONTRACTING OFFICER, phone:  (937) 255-7210 ext. 3810, email: Lawrence.doelker@wpafb.af.mil. (This is not a Research and Development (R&D) announcement).  

The Government anticipates awarding cost plus fixed fee (CPFF).  The period of performance will be 42 months for this effort with a range of $16M to a maximum of $20M. 

Successful contractors will be required to:

1.	Provide support to individual platform/store program offices in their efforts toward integration of UAI requirements into their specific Operational Flight Program (OFP) and Mission Planning Environment (MPE) upgrades. This support will be situational and will depend on need and a request from the Program Office for such support.  Support may be provided at all program phases of an OFP upgrade, including requirements definition and generation, system development and demonstration, and system testing and fielding.

2.	Provide Platform/Store Interface Control Document (PSICD),  Mission Planning (MPICD) and Launch Acceptable Region Data Package (LARDP) Super Joint Interface Control Working Group (SJICWG) support, to consist of secretariat functions utilizing a secure WEB site provided by the Government, providing key technical support in generating proposed changes or additions to the PSICD, MPICD, and LARDP packages and associated Certification Compliance Plans, as well as providing partial support from Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) programs not currently funded for UAI implementation to participate in SJICWG activities.  All SJICWG support will follow the specified processes outlined in the UAI Interface Control Plan. 

3.	Perform a Risk Reduction study for incorporation of follow on interface requirements into current UAI development efforts.  Follow on interface requirements are defined as those that are outside the scope of current UAI development efforts, and include but are not limited to: Air to Air stores; Post launch Communications (i.e. Weapons Data Link Network (WDLN); Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs); Joint Miniature Munition Interface (JMMI) and/or Miniature Munition/Store Interface (MMSI) interfaces currently used between Bomb Release Unit -61 (BRU-61) and Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I); targeting and training pods; joint service platform and store programs not included in current efforts; and foreign manufactured platforms and stores.  This effort will include technical reports and presentations documenting potential candidates identified, feasibility, trade studies, as well as roadmaps and plans for incorporating interfaces from these systems or technologies into the UAI program.  For those interfaces or technologies deemed feasible for near-term inclusion into UAI, draft Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and associated draft Interface Change Notices (ICNs) will be generated with respect to the appropriate PSICD, MPICD, and LARDP core Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) documents.  The draft ECPs/ICNs will either be incorporated into UAI core documents through formal SJICWG processes, accompanied by completion of quality assurance checklists by affected programs, or will otherwise be refined during follow on, full development efforts to address and incorporate these interfaces into UAI.

Technical Objective:  Contractor(s) shall define a protocol for achieving rapid, low cost integration of weapons onto aircraft by decoupling the integration from the aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP) update cycles.  Technical characteristics of the UAI protocol and the documents defining it shall be as follows:
–	UAI must be capable of being implemented on legacy aircraft and maintain compatibility of legacy stores.
–	UAI will not impose a common operating system across legacy aircraft or weapons.
–	UAI will not require an upload of an OFP.
–	For full UAI functionality, the aircraft must have ability to communicate with stores using a MIL-STD-1553 protocol, without violating the MIL-STD-1760 requirements for the use of standard messages.
–	Modification of existing stores to be compatible with UAI is allowed.
–	Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) will be used as the UAI mission planning baseline system.
–	The LAR efforts within SJICWG support shall include creation of a stand alone UAI LAR requirements document which may be included or referenced contractually in programs which choose to implement UAI compliant LAR algorithms.  Document created as part of the LARDP development efforts shall be used as a baseline in generating this requirements document. 
The core ICDs shall define and document a single set of messages (the “consolidated set”) that meet the requirements above.  These ICDs shall incorporate interface requirements and growth features to accommodate foreseeable new weapon interface requirements.  The ICDs will identify the existing weapons ICDs (the “superset”) that are used as baseline requirements in defining the consolidated set.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 336413, Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  In addition, interested sources must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing their technical expertise and experience, personnel and facilities. The response should also identify key technical risks, issues, and any partnering arrangements that may be considered.  All parties are asked to provide a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a facsimile number in their response.  Information marked “Proprietary” will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.

<DESC>On March 17, 2005, NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC) issued a sources sought notice for Facility Operating Services at the John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi.  At that time, it was expected that a competitive solicitation(s) would be issued and a contract or contracts would be awarded prior to August 27, 2006.  This current announcement is two fold.  First, to advise interested parties that the NASA SSC Facilities Operating Support Contract (FOSC) number NAS13-99030 is being extended on a sole source basis for one year due to the disaster conditions inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf region.  Second, as a substantial amount of time has passed since issuance of the original sources sought announcement, all interested parties are invited to respond to this second sources sought announcement for a future follow-on recompetition.	This extension is necessary, as the conditions left by Hurricane Katrina have severely limited the number of technical and acquisition staff members available to conduct a recompetition at this time.	Changing the FOSC contractor now, given the circumstances would severely disrupt SSC’s and the Gulf Coast’s recovery efforts.  The one-year extension is for the period of August 28, 2006 through August 27, 2007.  Notices regarding the FOSC recompetition activities will be posted through NASA’s Electronic Posting System to the FEDBIZOPS as they occur.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).   The requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type sevices.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Penny S. Parker no later than 3:00 pm on March 17, 2006.  Please reference FOS-01A in any response.

<DESC>Announcement:
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TSA ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TSAAMS).  The Transportation Security Administration intends to begin market research to obtain contract services to perform revenue administration services for Federal agencies.  These fees are imposed on multiple sectors of commerce and transportation.  Almost half of TSA’s approximately $5 billion annual budget is derived from these various transportation security fees.  

TSA intends to use the market research to determine a Qualified Vendor List (QVL) on a Small Business Set-Aside utilizing TSAAMS.  Contractors with experience performing revenue administration services as described below, for Federal agencies in the United States, are strongly preferred.  At the conclusion of evaluations for the potential solicitation, TSA may award a single Small Business contract to the successful offeror(s).  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541219.  Contractors are required to either register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system (www.ccr.gov) prior to submitting a capability statement and so indicate, or they must provide sufficient information in their capability statement to establish their small business status; instructions are provided later in this document.  Companies wishing to seek further information pertaining to this requirement should contact Zelda Proctor at Zelda.Proctor@dhs.gov. 

Instructions:
TSA intends to conduct market research to identify Small Businesses who have the potential to fulfill the TSA revenue administration services requirement.  Interested contractors shall provide a capability statement of no more than 10 pages to Zelda Proctor at Zelda.Proctor@dhs.gov.  The statement must detail the contractor’s capabilities and experience in successfully performing services for the development, implementation, and regulation of Federal user fees for Federal agencies.  Additionally, 1 to 3 contract/task order references should be provided as proof of prior experience.  The references should describe work performed for other Federal agencies within the last 5 years.  The references should be submitted as a Word document (tables are okay), and for each reference cite contract title and description, contracting officer and COTR, names, email addresses, phone numbers, contract and/or task number, dates of performance, and total contract price.  Include a short description of the objectives of the contract and if the objectives were met.  The contractor must also submit resumes of the proposed key employees capable of performing the functions identified below.  A letter of commitment must accompany the resumes for either current or contingent hire employees.  The resumes must be no more than 2 pages and should directly reflect relevant skills and experiences sought below.  Resumes are to be in addition to the capabilities statement (up to 3 resumes for potential key employees for each position will be considered, though only a minimum of one is required).  Offerors are instructed to email their capability statements to the address listed above.  Because of security screening requirements, DO NOT use the US Postal Service or overnight express service.  Emailed capability statements must be in either one (1) PDF or one (1) Microsoft Word document of no more than 10 single sided pages.  The submission of capability statements are due no later than February 24, 2006 by 2:00pm EST.  Single or multiple attachments or exhibits (other than resumes) will not be opened or considered.  TSA will not pay bid preparation costs for any responses to this announcement nor will proprietary information be evaluated. 


Introduction/Requirements:
The positions to be filled will be located at the Transportation Security Administration’s Headquarters in Arlington, VA.  The contractor must be able to provide TSA with three (3) full time equivalent (FTE) positions.  Each task outlined below will be performed by one position:

Development of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) market analysis and estimation, program cost estimation based on extensive knowledge of cost accounting principles and methodologies, establishment of fee development processes and fee forecast vs. actual collections analysis. 

Implementation of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) the implementation of a revenue collections platform within the agency’s newly implemented Core Accounting System, (with specific technical knowledge of Oracle Financials as implemented in a Federal agency/department) development and documentation of revenue procedures for security fee invoicing and remittance, development and maintenance of customer account structure for invoicing and remittance, and revenue analysis activities to assess various trends and payment/collection performance (e.g. account aging reports, etc.)

Regulation of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) maintenance of revenue collection records, identification and maintenance of customer compliance issues in the OR contact database, coordination and issuance of compliance correspondence with more than 200 commercial air carriers, security fee audit assistance and analysis as required, and assistance in the development of Government claims for customer bankruptcy proceedings.

Selection Process for QVL:
TSA requirements will be evaluated on a GO, NO/GO basis.  Offerors who DO NOT meet the TSA requirements identified as GO, NO/GO criteria WILL NOT be evaluated further on TSA requirements criteria. Only Small Businesses that meet the TSA requirements will be placed on the Qualified Vendor List (QVL) and will be determined to have a reasonable chance to compete in the solicitation.

Due to the potential number of Small Businesses that may be interested in participating in the requirement, TSA will follow a down-select acquisition approach which is as follows:

1) Select Offerors determined qualified for the Qualified Vendor List (QVL) (Phase I)
2) Issue the solicitation to the QVL directly via email (Phase II)
3) Issue a Single awards based on the evaluation of offerors (Phase III)

The first phase is to establish one QVL specifically for this procurement. The QVL will pre-qualify offerors seeking to compete for this requirement through mandatory GO, NO/GO technical qualifications.  

Capability statements will determine the contractor to be a GO, NO/GO candidate if past performance provided meets the scope of criteria stated in sections “Announcement” and “Introduction/Requirements” and has demonstrated the ability to effectively develop, implement and regulate user fees for Federal agencies.  The establishment of the QVL will streamline the acquisition process and allow for TSA to maintain greater control of the contract competition.

To be considered qualified, the Small Business must demonstrate, through its past performance, that it performed equivalent user fee services (aforementioned reference information is required).

After establishing the QVL, TSA plans to implement the second phase of the procurement by issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to the Small Business on the QVL.  The result of the RFP will be to award a single Small Business Set-Aside contract to the offeror evaluated to present the best value in terms of required technical and cost capabilities.  The RFP will include the objectives of the requirement and information on the criteria and evaluation of the RFP responses.

Additional Information:
The solicitation, when issued will be sent directly to the Small Businesses selected for the QVL, via email. The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an E-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Prior to issuance of the RFP, all potential contractors must be registered in CCR. You may access CCR at the following URL: www.ccr.gov. All vendors must supply the following information in your capability statement: Business Size, Company’s CCR Registration Number (if applicable), Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Street and Mailing Addresses, Contact Person Name, Telephone Number, and E-Mail Address. As required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) beginning January 1, 2005, all vendors are required to complete the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking collaborative partners to commercially produce cost-effective rollover protective structures (CROPS). In previous NIOSH work, CROPS designs have been developed, tested per ROPS consensus standard SAE J2194, and are available for commercialization by private industry.  The goal of this project is to improve the safety of farmers and other tractor operators by introducing lower cost retrofit ROPS options into the marketplace. Approximately half of the tractors in the United States have ROPS installed. This means that about 2.3 million tractors need ROPS installed. Previous NIOSH research has produced designs for the following five tractor models: Farmall-M, Farmall-H, Ford-8N, Ford-3000, and Ford-4000. These five tractor models represent more than 290,000 of all tractors operating in the U.S. without ROPS in 1993 (year of most complete survey data). This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward making CROPS designs for various tractor models affordable and attractive to a potentially large market.  Retrofit ROPS do exist for many tractor models. However, when installation costs are included, these ROPS can be cost prohibitive to tractor owners. NIOSH has developed CROPS designs with cost in mind and has targeted popular models which either have no retrofit ROPS currently available, or, if a retrofit ROPS does exist, it costs more than average (compared to other ROPS retrofit kits). The NIOSH designs assemble as components and can typically be installed by one person without the need for special lifting equipment. 

Candidate companies, which appear to provide the most promise of meeting the requirements listed below, will be evaluated by their capability to complete the research and development needed to bring CROPS designs into commercial production.   NIOSH does not guarantee to enter into collaboration with any presented company. NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering analysis/evaluation capabilities described in this announcement or other searches, if determined to be in the best interest of the government. 

CROPS Commercialization Capabilities Parameters: (Companies should meet all of these requirements, but highly innovative solutions are not discouraged from presentation or response.) 

(A) Providing significant intellectual, engineering, and technical expertise in manufacturing CROPS designs.  Provide assistance in setting realistic product cost objectives and provide suggestions on how CROPS designs can achieve product cost goals - Required; 
(B) Fabricating prototypes for test and evaluation. Prototype designs require the ability to cut and bend 3/8” steel plate and to cut tubing Painting or equivalent weather proofing - Required; 
(C) Producing commercial CROPS for purchase. Any partnering company assumes any/all liability for ensuring that commercial CROPS meet applicable federal and/or state regulations - Required; 
(D) Reviewing test results and recommending design modifications - Required; 
(F) Identifying sources of tractor frames needed to structurally test CROPS – Not required but desired.  

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to address these major areas. A company that is qualified and currently is producing ROPS or similar devices is highly desired. However, past testing and design of devices exactly like CROPS is not required. If prior testing has been performed, sample test information and results should be provided. Interested parties responding to this request should provide detailed information regarding capabilities, test results, and cost data.  Presentation material may consist of literature, electronic presentation, or video. (Samples and data provided to the government as part of this solicitation will not be returned to vendors following the completion of this project.) Data and/or product samples must be delivered to NIOSH within two weeks (10 business days) of the closing of this announcement. Although every effort will be made to consider all information received, the government will not be obligated to evaluate information received after the two week period. Vendors should note any proprietary data as such. If any data is to be excluded from exchange with any of the project participants, a statement of that fact shall be included with the statement of propriety.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrato r/ Product Support Provider for the FSSP. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance  (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of FSSP units.  Operator and maintenance training, and New Equipment Training (NET) will be TACOM responsibility .  The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the Product Manager will be responsible for system configuration, including recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliability  and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Improvement of Logistics Performance and Cost Reduction for Maintenance Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the FSSP is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance/rep a ir times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training, and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: * Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: * Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: * Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profile is for wartime Operations Tempo (Optempo).  See Appendix B for a profile of the FSSP. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: What is the business of the your company; i.e. large business, small business, 8 (a)? 1. Describe your companys experience, if any, in providing PBL support to army vehicles or systems. 2.  Have you successfully performed the in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other army or DoD vehicles or system? If so, on which vehicles or systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practic es you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating that with the current organic system? 5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipated within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, and providing relief from conducting sustainment training?  What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance? 8. How would your company manage a sustainment training program and reduce the Army training burden? 9. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support under a long-term contract?    10. Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime vs. peacetime situations. 11. Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined above are attainable? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Send responses to this market research survey questionnaire to the PM POCs by email: Joe Scott e-mail address: scottjoe@tacom.army.mil and Mathew Marturano e-mail address: marturam@tacom.army.mil   Your organization may provide response to all or part of t his questionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 24 Mar 05. The response can be marked as confidential. Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietary if appropriate. All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for responding  to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and collective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance ret urns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system.  Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE FSSP System:  Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) Model Designators:  Model XM106 (NSN 4930-01-504-2951) and Model XM107 (NSN 4930-01-504-2949) System Description: The Army requires systems to receive, issue, and store fuel delivered from theater supply points by ship, tanker truck and hose-line systems.   The Fuel System Supply Point (FSSP) is the primary system used to accomplish this fuel suppo rt mission TBD (To Be Determined).  Items listed as TBD are being evaluated during system testing and not available at this time. Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  FSSP fulfills the requirement for a rapidly deployed fuel supply systems that is adaptable and flexible to meet fuel supply demands.  To satisfy each units requirements the new FSSPs will have configuration flexibility. This is accomplished by using the b asic systems components, such as the pump/engine and filters, and varying total system capacity by adding the quantities of fabric fuel tanks, hoses, and other components.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Savannah Regional Contracting Center, Charleston Office is seeking potential contractors for the requirement for the above subject.  This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal.  This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine interest and capability of potential large and small (Small Business, Certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Business, HUBZone, a nd Service Disabled Veteran-Owned) firms to provide services requested.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 312113, Ice Manufacturing, with the small business size standard of 500 employees.  In accordance with the aforementioned NAICS code and size st andard, request that you identify the category of your firm. Your response must include the following information:  (1) Size of your business, (2) Name of your firm, (3) Point-of-Contact (4) Current email address (5)  Your firms mailing address and phone number, (6) Specialized Experience and technical competence to include:  a)  Experience with contracts of similar scope and size, b) capability to simultaneously respond to multiple disaster location and multiple delivery sites within those locations,  and  c)  ability to provide automated tracking/reporting and constant communication capabilities.  This information must be presented in a matrix format showing contracts you have performed.  The matrix shall show the most recent projects, not to exceed five, that demonstrate the capabilities necessary to meet the criteria listed above.  Include contract number, project location, description of work requirements, and contact and phone number for each project listed.  Firms should also indicate all applicable pe rsonnel and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract.  The Government intends to award one Requirements Contract with a base and three (3) option years.  The contract base period will be 365 days from the date of the contract award.  The period of a ny option will also be 365 days from the effective date of the modification signed by the Contracting Officer to exercise the option.  This contract is being issued in support of the National Response Plan (NRP), which is a signed agreement among 27 federa l departments and agencies, including the American Red Cross.  The NRP organizes the types of federal response assistance that a state or local government is most likely to need fewer than 15 Emergency Support Functions (ESFs), each of which has a designa ted primary agency.  The Department of Defense shares the responsibility with FEMA for ESF #3, Public Works and Engineering, and has designated USACE as its operating agent for ESF #3 planning, preparation and response.  USACE fulfills requirements for ice  at disaster locations first by using ice stored from previous disasters, donated ice, and ice supplied by other federal agencies and requirements for refrigerated storage first by utilization of donated reefers or Government-owned reefers.  If ice and/or refrigerated storage from those sources are inadequate to meet the required quantities, USACE purchases additional ice and/or rents mobile refrigerated storage units.  The primary purpose of this contract is to provide packaged ice and necessary supporting  items and services, to include refrigerated storage units (reefers), transportation, loading and unloading  of shipments, drayage, operation and maintenance of reefers, participation in Partnering activities and provision of Strategic Planning Services, e tc., in the Continental United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Federal States of Micronesia and  Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Time is of essence in the performance of this cont ract as the ice and the refrigerated storage units to be provided under this contract are required to sustain life in the aftermath of disasters that have or wi ll disrupt the normal source of refrigeration in disaster locations.  This contract requires immediate response, with timely production, delivery, and reporting by the Contractor.  Contractor must have GPS and/or similar tracking abilities for all shipment s and the ability to maintain communications even if there is no cellular coverage due to the storm.  The contractor may be required to respond to simultaneous disasters with deliveries to multiple sites for each disaster i.e., contractors may be required to handle four or five disasters/missions (in differing parts of the world) at one time.   There were four ice missions last year requiring a total of over 201,480,000 pounds of purchased ice.  A single order may require as much as 20 million pounds of ice  to be delivered within 24 hours.  This contract would require the contractor to arrange for production and transportation of ice.  Contractor shall provide real time tracking and reporting of expected time of arrival for each truckload.  Contractor shall have the capability to reroute trucks already in transit if necessary.  Contractor shall operate and maintain refrigerated storage trailers to include the refueling and dispatch of ice and refrigerated storage trailers to public distribution sites.  Contra ctor may be required to setup and operate commodities distribution site and/or unload palletized ice from refrigerated storage trailers by forklift.  The Contractor shall cooperate fully with public officials and other contractors in emergency and disaster  response and recovery operations.  Responses to this Sources Sought Announcement may be emailed to rose.smalls@usace.army.mil. Firms responding to this announcement must provide ALL of the required information requested.   Responses must be received no la ter than Tuesday, 28 February 2006 at 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time.

The services cover the daily oversight and operation  including the screening, outfitting and Phase 1 training for the Navy Provisional Guard Battalions supporting Detainee Operations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 
BACKGROUND.  NCBC Gulfport is the home of Navy Mobilization Processing Site (NMPS), Gulfport, MS, and as such, it has the responsibility to Mobilize Reserve personnel.  NMPS Gulfport, MS has processed several thousand personnel in support of Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Noble Eagle.  This processing capability and experience, led to the selection of NCBC Gulfport as the screening, outfitting, and Phase 1 training site for the Navy Provisional Guard Battalions (653 personnel) in support of Detainee Operations in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  

DISCUSSION.  The current team has processed one battalion, and is processng the second.  In order to meet the long range goals there are several aspects to consider.  The current processing team make-up, as a minimum, consist of  Reserve Component personnel who have been mobilized or recalled to duty for one year or longer to provide the services. The equivalent experience required, as a minimum, to perform the services are an 1105 CDR/LCDR – Fleet Support Officer, an administrative supervisor - E-7, a medical technician - HM1, two (2) supply clerks -SK ratings, two (2) administrative clerks -YN ratings, and an equipment operator -EO1  for transportation functions.  The processing generally falls into three (3) phases – Pre-Processing, Processing, and Post-Processing.

PRE-PROCESSING PHASE.
     a. Gather prospective members from order writers/Receiving Actual Orders
     b. Make berthing reservations based on initial database loading
     c. Order Uniforms based on e-mails/faxes of requests.  An average of 30% of pre-arrival uniform requests are received. Average group is 120 personnel
      d. Pre-event planning meeting
     e. Create Dog Tags from e-mails/faxes of requests. The number of pre-arrival requests for Dog Tags averages about 40 personnel.  
     f. Reserve the facilities.
     g. Obtain Security Clearance information prior to arrival of members, including daily verification and updating as needed based upon new orders received in the weeks prior to the members reporting.  	
     h. Coordinate arrival with Galley to ensure availability of  food and staff and adjustment in meal hours if necessary.
     i. Order Office Supplies, Shipping Materials, and Booklets for Training and Indoctrination..
     j. Develop Training Schedule and update the Indoctrination Briefs. 
    k.Collect members (their itineraries) information upon arrival and produce and update spreadsheet to use for planning/allocating transportation.

PROCESSING PHASE
    a. Gather arriving members orders
    b. Review Service Records for any outstanding issues, such as EAOS for the tour, NJP issues, Page 2 review, SGLI review, a detaching evaluation, and any unsatisfactory marks in the past two years, etc.
    c. Order Uniforms for members who did not submit a uniform request prior to arrival, and verifying the sizes of those who had previosly submitted a request and to issue uniforms.
    d. Review the Medical and Dental Records

POST-PROCESSING PHASE
  a. Update the Database
          Through coordination with the order writing authorities, determine if any “no-shows” will be arriving with later groups of personnel.  Also, coordinate any changes resulting from later arrivals, order modifications or cancellations with Supply personnel to ensure Dog Tag or Uniform requests are properly adjusted.
  b. Make berthing reservations for members who did not complete screening
  c.  Forward incomplete or rework uniform issues via appropriate method (FedEx, etc.) to members.  
  d. Conduct post processing meeting to discuss lessons learned and identify process improvements.
   e. Function as Trasit Processing Unit personnel who failed to complete processing or failed the screening.  This could require additional medical treatment.  It may also result in mustering/detaching to perform work assignments around CBC. 

ROUTINE OPERATION
The task indicated above does not include time spent in the daily performance of the staff assigned responsibilities of the CRC Gulfport. The staff is still responsible for such routine functions as providing leave, liberty, advancement, evaluations, physical training, etc. that have to be performed at any navy organization.

U. S. COAST GUARD HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	BACKGROUND:

The US Coast Guard (USCG) operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Currently these aircraft are being externally stripped and painted at the Coast Guard’s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  These aircraft have recently been experiencing paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the Coast Guard intends to have one of its HU-25 aircraft commercially painted, for field evaluation.  This RFQ establishes the minimum external paint requirements for this aircraft.
.  





2.0	OBJECTIVE:
            
The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized service center with an onsite paint facility to prepare and externally paint one HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) commercial practices and the paint manufacturer’s recommended procedures.  Dassault Falcon Jet, Plaisir, France is the OEM.  The general scope of work is as follows:               
            
2.1	Pre-paint surface preparation IAW commercial specifications.  Contractor to identify  
       specifications in the quote.

Note:  Some areas of the aircraft are covered after assembly of the aircraft.  These areas were painted during the interim paint phase of the PDM evolution and will require scuff sanding and feathering so the contractor applied coatings will blend in with USCG coatings previously applied during interim paint as required.  Examples: Flight control surface leading edges, horizontal/vertical stabilizer attachment points, box structures and cavities.  Color match is critical for this contract and future aircraft maintenance (see Attachment 2).  Attachment 2 lists coatings that are currently used by the USCG and are known to provide satisfactory results on USCG aircraft operating in a corrosive environment when properly applied.

2.2	Prime, paint and stencil the aircraft’s exterior surfaces IAW ARSC drawing 925-139, using Stencil/Decal Kit 925-139-1 and the paint manufactures recommended procedures.

2.3	Apply leading edge tape and radome boot IAW ARSC Drawing 925-139.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2006)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

•	         The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on  
                     technical superiority.  The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the  
                     selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as 
                     measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical
                       Factor 2 – Past Performance
                       Factor 3 – Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors
Enclosure (1)


DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical/Management Approach

The technical will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Vendor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Painting.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Vendor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical approach includes:
 
(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical quote that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

&#61607;	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing these services.
&#61607;	Clear lines of communication between the Vendor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.

(d)	The Vendor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO  
        9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service  
        bulletins, and FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document..
.


Factor 2:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Vendor’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard reserves the right to investigate other sources of past performance other than those submitted by the contractor.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Vendor’s actual performance on painting of similar or like aircraft.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.  To include experience is applying High Solid VOC compliant paints to high speed aircraft.

Contractor’s customer ratings including quality ratings, customer service, warranty, recommendation for future service and performance of coating during the aircraft’s operational period (e.g. gloss, adhesion, and paint defects).

               
Factor 3:  Cost/Price

Each Vendor’s cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed cost/price.  Vendor’s quote shall be a firm-fixed-price.  USCG cost evaluation will be based considering two criteria: 1) Vendor’s quote; 2) USCG travel cost and roundtrip aircraft ferry cost from Elizabeth city, NC.  There is no intent to sacrifice quality for schedule.    

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN in the Offeror’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror’s technical proposal.  The price quote should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

a.  The government will multiply the quantity for each increment, by the dollar amount entered by the offeror.

Example:

CLIN 0002AB

  50 People x $250 = $12,500
  75 People x $200 = $15,000
100 People x $150 = $15,000
132 People x $100 = $13,200
357 People 	       $40,700

b.  The government will divide $40,700 by 357.people ($40,700/357 = $114.01). The weighted average is  $114.01.

c.  The government will divide 357 by 4 (357/4 = 89). The average number of people is 89.

d.  The government will multiply the average number of people, by the weighted average (89 x $114.01 = $10,146.89).  The total amount for CLIN 0002AB is $10,146.89.

e.  The evaluated dollar amount is $10,146.89, for CLIN 0002AB.. 

2.  OPTION TO EXTEND TERM OF CONTRACT (FAR 52.217-9)

a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.

The following CLINs are applicable:

0001AB - Three month option period
0002AB - Three month option period
0002AC - Three month option period

Reps & Certs are to be completed at least annually by vendors online through the ORCA portion of the Business Partner Network (BPN).  Contractors, presently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), can get a head start by going to www.bpn.gov/orca/ to activate their ORCA profiles.  Initially, ORCA will retain the most significant contractor reps & certs that would apply to any acquisition in the form of 26 questions.  Solicitation specific Reps & Certs may still be used outside of ORCA.  Further information on this initiative may be obtained from the ORCA help menu, http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx.  This help menu includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and the ORCA handbook.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334511 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  However, this procurement is unrestricted and any interested contractors may submit a quote. 

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Trace Explosive & Narcotic Biosensor to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

***Background

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive and narcotic detectors, which protect the general public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation and innovative technology for trace explosives and narcotics detection. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use such detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to conduct research on the performance capabilities of emerging trace detection systems being deployed that can rapidly scan people and other items passing through security screening checkpoints for the presence of trace explosives or narcotics. As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of detector systems are being developed. For this purpose, NIST has several trace explosive/narcotics detectors that represent current technology. A new technology is emerging that utilizes biomimetic antibody-analyte responses to detect a wide variety of trace explosives and drugs simultaneously in one system. NIST requires a representative system to measure performance criteria and consider the standards needs of such biosensors.*** 
 
***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  Line Item 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Trace Explosive & Narcotic Biosensor.

***The device shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:

1.  The instrumental detection system(s) must be based on a biomimetic antibody-analyte response design.
2.  The system must be capable of simultaneous detection of nanogram-sized quantities of explosives and narcotics within the analysis time specified below.
3.  The following analytes must be detectable: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT), nitroglycerin (NG), cocaine, morphine, heroine, and amphetamine.  
4.  Analysis time must be less than 20 seconds per sample. 
5.  Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection(see Note 1)) to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below).
6.  The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

*** Installation/Training/Warranty

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up and one (1) training session for five (5) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation/set-up and demonstration of performance specifications (as described below), but shall be completed no later than 30 days after delivery.
2.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone support for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.***


*** Inspection and Acceptance Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications as follows:  Using standard materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes (deposited as solutions onto the primary collection grid) at twice the LOD or LOD90 as specified by the supplier. This level for each analyte will be the “detector challenge” (DC)(see Note 2)  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and will be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses.  The instrument must demonstrate the required 20 sec throughput requirement during all normal analyses.***

Note 1 -- The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal. In IMS, background variations are very much smaller than the measurement repeatability (standard deviations) of reference samples, so samples at strictly defined LODs would exhibit a false negative rate of about 50 percent (assuming that the alarm thresholds were set at the LODs). To define an LOD where a positive alarm would be expected reliably (over 90 percent of the time), we must factor in the measurement variability. We define this value (LOD90) as the amount of substance that generates a mean signal three times greater than the standard deviation (s) of the individual measurements. The conversion from measurement units (a.u.) to amount of substance (mass) is via the slope of the sensitivity curve (S). We also assume that the mass of analyte in the blank is zero.

LOD90 = 3 • s • S, where S = delta (mass)/delta (a.u.)

Note 2 -- The Detector Challenge (DC), where the false negative rate should be negligible, is arbitrarily defined as the amount of substance that should generate a signal twice the LOD90, so that,

DC = 2 LOD90

    a wage determination matter

 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour

 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR HIGH VOLTAGE HYBRID VARIABLE AMPLIFIERS FOR PRECISE CONTROL OF PZT PIEZOACTUATORS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purposes of this amendment are to provide additional instructions for submitting a quote in response to this synopsis/RFQ.  These instructions are:  Each company that submits a quote of an equivalent other than ScienLab SL360/005HA must submit the specifications for the equivalent to Erica.D.Carter-1@nasa.gov by the due date for submission of quotes (currently, not later than 3:00pm CST February 22,2006). In addition, this amendment is to provide questions and answers: Question 1.  Can the output of the amplifier be "floating" (meaning that it is not referenced to earth electrical ground)? Answer: The nature of our specification dictates it is "floating" and that it is a "bi-polar" variable output, proportional to the input (Current and/or Voltage) signal. Question 2.  Is additional output current beyond the stated requirement desirable? Answer: No, the amplifier output currently specified is driven by the macro-fiber composite piezo actuators which have a specific voltage, capacitive load and current operating range and facilitates electrical protection of those actuators. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) by 3:00pm CST February 22, 2006.
