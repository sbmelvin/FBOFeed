The Government physically does not have in its possessionsufficient,accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than thecurrent source(s). The design of this part is unstable. Engineering,manufacturing, or performance characteristics indicate that the required designobjectives have not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because thepart has a low process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance duringtests or service use. These changes will render the present part obsolete andunusable in its present configuration. Limited acquisition from the presentsource is anticipated pending configuration changes.

Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source.

Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
