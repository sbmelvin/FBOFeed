<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) intends to negotiate with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, a contract consisting of one base-year and four one-year options, for services titled "HIV Research Network". This is a renewal of contract No. HHSA290200600025C with Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, whose work on this study extends back more than 10 years.
<p><br />The main focus of this project is to collect recent data on provision of health services to people with HIV infection, based on a sample that is large, diverse in terms of sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race/ethnicity, HIV transmission group, insurance), and diverse geographically. The project collects information not only on HIV patients' background characteristics, but also on utilization of health services and relevant clinical data, such as values of CD4 and HIV-1 RNA laboratory tests. In order to assess trends over time in HIV service provision, access to and disparities in care and outcomes of care, data are collected yearly and amalgamated into a longitudinal database. The current database includes data from 2000 through 2009, and data from 2010 will be incorporated by the end of the current contract in September, 2011. The proposed project will continue data collection for calendar years 2011-2015, using established protocols to ensure continuity and consistency of data across time.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal. However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to continue with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Air Vehicle Planning System V (APS V) <br />POC: Jeff Kasza, 402-294-4098. Alternate POC: Stacy Mazurek , 402-294-6203</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: FA4600-11-R-0028</p>
<p>APPROXIMATE SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: June 2011. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a full and open competition, non-personal services, cost plus incentive fee contract for a base period and six (6) one year option periods. In addition, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services will be included. This effort is to provide Air Vehicle Planning System capabilities for USSTRATCOM. Contract Transition period is expected to be 180 days starting approximately between 1 August 2012 and 31 January 2013. The Air Vehicle Planning System (APS) software is a full fidelity (able to plan fully validated missions down to the individual sortie level) force-level mission planning system that performs planning functions in support of the nation's nuclear war plan and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM). APS is currently used to plan missions involving the following aircraft and weapon systems: B-52, B-2, KC-135, KC-10, RC-135, U-2, EP-3, Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM), Advanced Cruise Missile (ACM), and CALCM. APS also contains capability to plan DCA, F15/16/18, but this functionality is not in current use. The APS application is used to perform Air Vehicle planning operations, including maintenance operations, exercise and adaptive planning for the Operational Plan (OPLAN), non-nuclear OPLAN planning, and non-nuclear planning. Tasks include route Generation, Mating and Ranging, Timing, Verification, Data Products and Tape Build. Results and outputs are also used by other applications. The software is also used to perform maintenance operations, as required, for an existing OPLAN. The APS mission planning software requirement includes: on-site support for USSTRATCOM planners; engineering and software services for maintenance and analysis of Government-owned mission planning software; provision of interoperability with other necessary programs; correction of known software deficiencies; incorporation of guidance changes; maintenance of the capability to fix both non-critical and emergency (critical) Software Change Requests (SCRs); and application training of USSTRATCOM personnel. The requirement also includes provisions for enhancements and code development. <br /><br />Contractor must be able to meet all requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), certification requirements, and appropriate security clearances. This project is classified up to Top Secret. Individuals may require access to Nuclear Command and Control-Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2-ESI), Special Compartmentalized Information (SCI), Special Acess Program (SAP), and Alternate Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM). An interim Top Secret clearance does not satify DD254 requirements. Contractor must comply with guidelines specified in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification (draft DD Form 254 to be issued with the draft RFP). This acquisition will be conducted using negotiated procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Request For Proposal (RFP) and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government wide point of entry. A draft solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizopps.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically, except for the Technical Library CD, which will be provided at the Preproposal Conference/Site Visit (see Section L1.12 of the draft RFP). The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $25M. Anticipated award date is summer 2012. Address questions via-mail to the contracting officer or contract specialist only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<CONTACT>Thaddeus E Rollins, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2427, Fax 770-488-2670, Email tnr6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health(NCEH), Healthy Homes &amp; Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch, intends to award a sole source, 10 months firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 15- Acquisition by Negotiation to the Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc, 2714 Hudson St, Baltimore, MD 21224.
<p>The Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc is the current contractor of work being performed of a previous awarded task order. The unique nature of the projects requires the capacity for the contractor to manage a complex project with national scope at 16 diverse sites across the US. The contractor must possess exceptional skills in partnership building at both the national &amp; local level to leverage resources; expertise in green housing building &amp; remediation; provide strong leadership and organizational structure to coordinate the national involvement at the 16 sites; and have proven success in these areas with CDC and HUD.</p>
<p>This project will result in the establishment of the Green Healthy Housing Initiative (GHHI) pilot in 14 communities to: 1) Promote the development of competent and effective public health workforce by building core capacity of environmental public health professionals. 2) Support the Healthy People 2010 (soon to be 2020) initiative by focusing on Environmental Health, Injury and Violence Prevention, and Public Health Infrastructure. 3) Support the CDC Healthy Places and Healthy Housing Goals. 4) Develop the local infrastructure to demonstrate that the GHHI approach is effective in more comprehensively addressing multiple home-based health hazards in a manner that reduces costs, leverages resources, and produces better health outcomes for occupants. This acquisition is authorized by the program authorization: Section 317(k) (2) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. Section 247b (k) (2) <br />There is not another contractor other than the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning who can continue responsibility for this national 16 site project without jeopardizing accomplishment of the desired goals. The complex nature of this national on-going project requires continuity of contractor management and site coordinator staff, and most importantly, maintaining previously established local and national partnerships at the sites. Because this is sole source procurement, no solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc.<br />CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />CDC believes that Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference&nbsp;Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 16 February 2011.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The calculation of the CRP depends on many factors, including the financial condition (future and projected) of the applicant and the amount of collateral offered to secure the loan. In order to calculate the CRP for each loan application, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has previously developed, through a contractor, the Railroad Credit Risk Assessment (RCRA) System. The RCRA, which has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), relies on the latest default credit rating experience available for corporations in the private sector. Thus, the RCRA must be updated on an annual basis. The RCRA is also used to comply with OMB's requirement to re-estimate subsidy costs for each loan on a yearly basis. </span></p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Agilent Technologies for the purchase of an atomic force microscopy / scanning probe microscopy (AFM/SPM) system under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>The required AFM/SPM system will allow characterization of materials and processes critical to energy conversion and solar fuels and will guide development and innovation of novel catalysts for emerging energy technologies.</p>
<p>The required EPR spectrometer system offers demonstrated turnkey operation of Scanning Microwave Microscopy (SMM) at variable frequency from 100 MHz to at least 6 GHz. Here, SMM is defined as simultaneous AFM and measurement of transmitted and reflected microwave signal with a vector network analyzer (VNA). So-called SMMs based on ac scanning tunneling microscopy are not acceptable for NIST's intended use. Demonstration shall include published ability to produce low noise images at room pressure of nanometer-size dopant gradients in silicon and sub-surface imaging of the buried metal lines in a typical BEOL process. The required instrument shall be proven as capable of applying and processing microwave frequency radiation throughout its signal pass and have available nose cones/tip holders designed to prevent undesired radiation of microwave radiation while directing it to the terminal tip. The required instrument is suitable for examining existing and emerging BEOL processes, such as through wafer vias, buried metal line integrity, intermetal dielectric quality, level-to-level vias, including carbon nanotube bundles is required. The instrument shall also be capable of a broad range of microwave frequency measurements.</p>
<p>The SMM mode of the required Agilent instrument allows detailed measurements of reflected microwave signal applied to an atomic force microscope tip as a function of frequency, intensity and phase. Through its software, the signal can be interpreted as impedance and capacitance of the tip-sample structure. These measurements offer a unique method of characterization of dopant gradients in semiconductors and also have unique applications in characterizing the transport properties of nano-electronic structures and nano-interconnects - all NIST critical measurement needs and research topics. The variable frequency aspect of the measurement is unique and offers measurement capability beyond the more traditional scanning capacitance microscopy technique. Unlike low-frequency measurements, microwave reflectance measurements requires careful engineering of the nosecone (tip holder) and the interface between the nosecone and external electronics, as well as integration of the external microwave source and vector network analyzer (VNA). The Agilent instrument is the only instrument where appropriate nosecones have been engineered, the SMM capability has been experimentally demonstrated, and the appropriate software and electrical connections to an external VNA have been integrated into a scanning probe microscope system with atmospheric control.</p>
<p>The atomic force microscopy / scanning probe microscopy (AFM/SPM) system offered by Agilent is the only commercially available integrated system that meets all of NIST's specific research needs.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (Eastern) on June 9, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT: The contractor shall furnish weigh tickets from state certified scales for each delivery made.  Payment will be made on actual quantities received and accepted.
TESTING:  The contractor shall submit a test sample to the government for suitability evaluation prior to the actual delivery or acceptance of the cover aggregate.
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT:  The control of noxious weeds shall be achieved through a weed management plan:
All parties submitting quotes must have a source of material with a current weed management plan that has been approved by the local county weed board and Yellowstone National Park.  All plans require one annual inspection by park staff during the growing season (June - August) prior to the sale of material.  Parties submitting quotes must provide proof of the most recent weed inspection by Yellowstone National Park staff.
The weed inspection will designate a pit in one of three rating categories:  acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable.  Material from a pit designated as unknown or unacceptable can be used if it is heat treated to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and promptly transported from the quarry to the park or a pre-approved weed free storage area to prevent possible weed contamination.  (Note: Contractors that previously submitted a weed certificate under RFQ# Q1574115016 need only so indicate.)
A list of weeds of concern can be obtained from Yellowstone National Park.
The control of noxious weeds shall be further achieved by the following method:
HAULING:  All vehicles and equipment to be used in Yellowstone National Park shall be thoroughly pressure washed prior to arrival.  Equipment shall be inspected at the appropriate park entrance station by a designated park employee and only clean equipment shall be permitted into the park.  Particular attention must be shown to the under carriage and any surface where soil containing exotic weed seeds may exist.  All loaded trucks and trailers shall be covered (tarped) when loaded.   These efforts are critical to prevent the introduction and establishment of non-native plant species into the park.  Equipment inspection will be scheduled by the maintenance office and take place at the park entrance stations.  Inspection records shall be maintained by the park service.  Equipment found operating in the park that has not been inspected shall be dead-lined and subject to a citation.  The maximum combined length for trucks pulling trailers in Yellowstone NP is 75 feet.

<RESPDATE>091911
<CONTACT>Vanessa Seymour, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-696-4591, Email vanessa.seymour@navy.mil - Brian A Almquist, Program Officer, Phone (703) 696-3351, Email brian.almquist@navy.mil
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is seeking white papers describing innovative technology solutions leading to wide-area detection, classification, localization and tracking of surface and near-surface drifting / oscillating mines and prediction of mine drift from direct environmental observations and ocean models to support tactical planning. Surface and near-surface drifting mines include: mines designed to drift on the ocean surface; mines designed to drift and oscillate near the ocean surface within a preset depth range; improvised explosive devices intentionally cast adrift to harass maritime traffic; and moored mines intentionally or unintentionally separated from a tether.
<p>There are two distinct but strongly connected products that work together to enable effective planning and conduct of mine countermeasures (MCM) operations in drifting mine environments. They are: (1) Compact Modular Sensor / Processing Suite (CMSS), and; (2) Mine Drift Tactical Decision Aid (TDA). It is likely that mature hardware solutions already exist and that the required innovation will come from the optimization of a sensor suite, the development of real-time target recognition algorithms, and techniques to characterize the environment in real-time onboard the platform.</p>
<p>1. Compact Modular Sensor and Processing Suite (CMSS)</p>
<p>The Compact Modular Sensor and Processing Suite (CMSS) is a wide-area search, multi-mission, platform-independent sensor package to provide real-time detection, classification, and localization of surface and near-surface drifting / oscillating mines through the fusion of compact sensors, advanced algorithms, and real-time onboard processing technologies. The deliverable will be a sensor package with improved algorithms integrated with data processing for real-time detection, classification, localization, and tracking from a tactical unmanned airborne vehicle (TUAV). The classification must be onboard the TUAV in real-time to allow for immediate neutralization of the target by a separate system (not addressed in this BAA). The sensor suite must also provide in-situ information about the environment to be used with the Mine Drift TDA to predict drift trajectories. Possible sensors include, but are not limited to, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Real Aperture Radar (RAR), and Electro-Optic Sensors.</p>
<p>2. Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA)</p>
<p>The Mine Drift Tactical Decision Aid (TDA) will enable MCM planning operations in areas threatened by near-surface drifting mines. It will: (1) predict drift trajectories using real-time environmental and target observations from CMSS, oceanographic model data, and other sources to provide intelligent preparation of the environment before operations commence and situational awareness during operations; (2) provide tools to allow optimal deployment of the CMSS for search and/or environmental information gathering; and (3) provide tools to generate a ship maneuver plan which minimizes risk of engaging drifting threats. The final product will be a set of modular software components integrated into the existing mine warfare command and control environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>Offerors can choose to propose solutions that address the entire problem or select aspects of the problem that best match their experience and capabilities. To facilitate this, ONR has broken down the problem into separate tasks. Offerors choosing to propose a solution to the entire problem must provide a separate white paper for each task.<br />(1) Wide-Area Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of Surface Drifting Mines</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to demonstrate wide-area detection, classification, localization and tracking of surface drifting mines as well as the collection of data to be used to characterize the ocean environment. The emphasis is on targets that are on or close to the ocean surface but not submerged under the ocean surface enough to require the use of sensors designed to penetrate a substantial amount of water.</p>
<p>The data collected will be used for the development and evaluation of target recognition algorithms and characterization of the ocean environment. The data will be delivered in a Government specified format for distribution to performers working on the development of target recognition algorithms (Task 3) or characterization of the ocean environment (Task 4). The contractor(s) will participate in the flight test and data collection. The Government anticipates data collection to occur within 12 to 15 months after contract award.</p>
<p>(2) Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of Near-Surface Drifting and/or Oscillating Mines</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to demonstrate detection, classification, localization and tracking of near-surface drifting and oscillating mines as well as the collection of data to be used to characterize the ocean environment. The emphasis is on targets that are submerged below the ocean surface enough to require the use of sensors that can penetrate a substantial amount of water.</p>
<p>The data collected will be used for the development and evaluation of target recognition algorithms and characterization of the environment. The data will be delivered in a Government specified format for distribution to selected contractors working on target recognition algorithms (Task 3) or characterization of the environment (Task 4). The contractors will participate in the flight test and data collection. The Government anticipates data collection to occur within 15 to 24 months after contract award.</p>
<p>(3) Target Recognition Algorithm Development</p>
<p>This task will develop two sets of detection &amp; classification algorithms; one set for surface mines (i.e., with a surface expression) and one for submerged mines (up to the working depths of the sensors). White papers may address only one or both of these algorithm sets. A single algorithm set addressing both surface and submerged mines is also acceptable. The data sets emerging from Task 1 and Task 2 will not be available immediately; therefore contractors are encouraged to use existing data sets containing relevant targets to begin the demonstration of proposed algorithms before newly collected data sets are made available. Offerors must have access to existing data sets or demonstrate the ability to acquire existing data sets. The sensor details will depend on Task 1 &amp; Task 2, but sensing modalities may include synthetic aperture radar, passive electro-optic, and active electro-optic. Additional consideration should be given to exploiting information including but not limited to thermal, polarimetry, and multispectral. Algorithms should accept raw data and produce data products according to a Government specified format. They should be modular such that they can be demonstrated in both post-mission software architecture and deployed in an embedded, real-time, power constrained TUAV. The primary challenge in algorithm design for this application stems from the extreme variability in environmental conditions. Therefore, in order to be considered competitive, the white papers must provide enough information to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have sufficient ability to adapt to these variations. Further, offerors are encouraged to consider the use of performance estimation models to both estimate/report expected and in situ performance as well as optimally adapt the detection and classification process to the particular environment encountered. The Government anticipates data sets to be available within 2 - 3 months after completion of each data collection flight test as described in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4.</p>
<p>(4) Characterization of the Ocean Environment</p>
<p>In this task, a test-bed with one or more sensors will be optimally configured and flight tested to enable observation of environmental phenomena relevant to the Detection, Classification, Localization, and Tracking of surface drifting mines and near-surface drifting and oscillating mines. The observations should be suitable for determining directional surface gravity wave spectra, surface currents, and indicators of optical properties of the water column, at a minimum. It is expected that sensing approaches to Tasks 1 and Task 2 and data collected during those tasks may also be suitable for environmental characterization; however, additional sensors may be necessary or desired to collect the information needed to characterize the environment.</p>
<p>(5) Mine Drift Prediction Tactical Decision Aid (TDA)</p>
<p>This task will integrate environmental data generated in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4 as well as other sources (which may include in situ drifting sensors, output from NAVO models, intelligence products, among others) to produce an optimal forecast of mine drift, dispersion and probability of detection. A hierarchy of oceanographic models should be considered to address data availability, since data available for assimilation into forecasting models may be abundant, sparse or non-existent. Mine drift forecasts will be integrated into a set of planning tools to enable preparation of the battlespace before operations and situational awareness during operations. At a minimum, TDA planning tools should provide the capability to plan efficacious deployment of CMSS, and the capability to plan ship maneuvers. The deliverable is a stand-alone software service compatible with MIW C2 (e.g., MEDAL-EA, EPMA and NSAM).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates integrating a final test bed configuration for the purpose of simultaneously collecting data with the sensors demonstrated in Task 1, Task 2, and Task 4.</p>
<p>Offerors should submit separate white papers for each task of interest. Offerors addressing two or more tasks may also submit a separate overview document describing synergies between tasks.</p>
<p>White papers should propose solutions which are suitable for deployment from a tactical unmanned airborne vehicle (TUAV) flying at a minimum altitude of 3000 feet and at a minimum velocity of 75 knots. Target detection and classification shall be conducted in real-time onboard the TUAV to enable immediate neutralization of the target by a separate system. Proposed solutions must be able to demonstrate: (1) a high probability of detection, low number of false contacts, and classification onboard the platform to a level sufficient to classify the target with a high level of confidence; and (2) characterization of the environment in real-time onboard the platform. The technology solutions must be demonstrated at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6.</p>
<p><br />After down-selecting white papers, full proposals may be requested from selected candidates. The maturity level of any hardware proposals addressing this BAA should be sufficient to support early Government supported testing. Testing will be over realistic target fields and will provide data sets to Task 3, and Task 5 performers. The ONR will require that all data sets collected be provided to the Government in a format suitable for distribution to additional performers to develop data handling and processing techniques, real-time algorithms and onboard classification techniques, and data fusion techniques.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the USSOCOM SPOTR requirement and the solicitation is tentatively scheduled for release in May 2011. The SPOTR is a device to be used in conjunction with the Handheld Laser Marker (HLM) that allows operators to verify that their 1064-nm energy is on target at the intended ranges of the HLM. The device must be no more than 2 lbs and be operable by a single operator while using the HLM for its intended purpose (Note: one hand needs to remain free for keying the radio). The SPOTR shall be capable of determining/detecting/verifying 1064-nm laser energy in day, night, or day &amp; night conditions. The SPOTR is intended to provide dismounted SOF operators with spot on target capability that is immediately accessible - i.e. can be worn in a MOLLE pouch on load bearing equipment. The SPOTR shall not produce a visual signature or audible signature that will place a user at risk of detection.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 333314. USSOCOM intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (5-year) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) line items.</p>

Offerors will also provide 3 sets of batteries (rechargeable or disposable), a lab power cable used in evaluating the product samples, any environmental test data that was collected in the creation of the SPOTR, a listing of any environment tests that they are not willing to submit to, a quick reference guide to indicate operations of the SPOTR, documentation for determining reliability, documentation for the battery packs, and a 110-VAC (volts alternate current) wall plug battery recharging device if rechargeable batteries are provided as a power source.</p>
<p>The contract minimum quantity is projected to be 2 each LRIP SPOTR with a contract maximum of 1,000 each Production units. The contract will contain, but is not be limited to, contract line item numbers (CLINs) for the following items: SPOTR LRIP and Production systems along with Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs).</p>
<p>A small business subcontracting plan is required for all offerors that do not meet the small business size standards under NAICS Code 333314.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov. For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<DESC><p><br />NAICS Code:<br />541712-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)- 1000 employees<br /><br />Purpose:<br />The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to identify sources capable of fulfilling requirements needed to conduct Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) on flight software used for launch and orbit mode operations.</p>
<p>Incumbent Contractor<br />The incumbent contractor is Integral Systems Inc (ISI), 6721 Columbia Gateway, Columbia, MD 21046.</p>
<p>Description: <br />The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Defense Meteorological Space Systems Division (DMSSD) intends to release a solicitation to acquire Flight Software Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) services. The DWSD/DMSSD requires an independent certification for spacecraft flight software to ensure that the software satisfies the operational mission requirements. A contractor independent of the software developer (Lockheed Martin) will accomplish this certification using a formal process identified as Independent Verification and Validation. The DMSP spacecraft, F-13 through F-20, are subject to the Independent Verification and Validation process. The contractor shall provide Independent Verification and Validation for the lift and ascent phase software which is controlled by the Separation Deployment Code (SDC). When the spacecraft transitions to the on-orbit phase, the Orbit Mode Software (OMS) replaces the SDC. The OMS is the code used for the mission lifetime of the satellite and requires the most intensive Independent Verification and Validation efforts. Because the DMSP flight software is modular, Independent Verification and Validation requires testing of new or modified code for the functions of each changed module, as well as the interactions of all connected modules. The Independent Verification and Validation process includes reporting and documenting all anomalies found, recommending solutions to the government, and tracking all errors through to resolution. <br />The software itself contains approximately 35,000 16-bit memory locations. The software is written in assembly language for operation on Standard Controls Processor 234s (SCP-234s), both on-orbit and on the ground. The code has many interwoven sections and contains minimal documentation. The Independent Verification and Validation effort requires a detailed understanding of DMSP attitude control, housekeeping, and command and control. Specifically, this effort requires an in-depth understanding of DMSP background control algorithms, code sequencing of commands, redundancy management of gyros and data buses, and code effects on hardware malfunctions. <br />This Independent Verification and Validation effort requires utilization of the Real-time Interactive DMSP Simulator (RIDS) which is government owned equipment. The RIDS simulates the operational spacecraft for verification, validation, and certification of software. The purpose of verification of the flight code is to ensure agreement and correctness between the code and the specifications for the code using detailed software tools. The verification process shall include software comparison, design analyses, code analyses, and mission parameter verification. Validation of the flight software code must include running the code through all operational conditions and some anomalous conditions and excursions on the RIDS. The final outcome of Independent Verification and Validation efforts is the contractor's certification of the flight software. The certification process must ensure all flight software is correct from launch to full operational capability (FOC). The software must be free from errors and defects detectable through Air Force approved test procedures. Furthermore, the contractor must certify the code installed on the spacecraft 48 hours prior to launch, ensuring the correct software version is loaded on the spacecraft's SCP-234 computers.</p>
<p>Contractor's Capability: <br />In support of the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) efforts, the contractor must supply and maintain all computer functions outside of the RIDS. These functions must include the processing of RIDS data for technical assessments of software capabilities. The Independent Verification and Validation contractor will depend on the RIDS provider to perform all RIDS hardware maintenance support. The maintenance of the two SCP-234 computers in the RIDS will be supplied by the RIDS contractor. <br />The Independent Verification and Validation contractor must maintain a history of all documentation for each satellite. This documentation includes all the code in each operational satellite, all pre-launch code analysis, and all validation results. Independent Verification and Validation efforts must be fully documented in technical reports and delivered to the government as a contract data requirements list (CDRL). All library items must be stored redundantly on two separate systems. <br />The contractor must participate and support in person certain pre-launch tests with the actual satellite. The contractor shall provide technical support at the operations center during early orbit operations to assist with resolution of on-orbit anomalies. In addition, the contractor must support management reviews and technical meetings. The contractor must support quarterly Flight Software Working Groups (FSWG) and conduct semi-annual management reviews that include providing accurate financial data. Finally, the contractor must support phase-in, transition, and phase-out periods as necessary.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: <br />The period of performance is anticipated to be for one basic year with four one-year options and an option for phase-out. The contract will begin in Jan 2013 lasting through calendar year 13 (CY13) (base year). If the four one-year options are exercised, the contract will last through CY17.</p>
<p>Request for Proposal (RFP): <br />The projected RFP release date for this effort is anticipated to be in&nbsp;September 2011.</p>
<p>Statement of Capability: <br />Interested offerors must state attributes in the following areas: 1) Expertise and experience in IV&amp;V space flight software, 2) Experience with space flight software and space flight computers, 3) Knowledge of ascent (boost phase) attitude control for deployment of satellites into orbit, 4) In-depth knowledge of on-orbit operations in attitude control, housekeeping, power management, and command functions for DMSP satellites, 5) Experience with autonomous operations and automatic redundancy management satellites, 6) Knowledge of DMSP software, 7) Experience with development and maintenance of software simulations for ascent and on-orbit phases of satellite hardware and environment, 8) Capability to install, maintain, and upgrade the hardware for host computers, satellite simulators, and peripheral support equipment, 9) Experience with production and publication of large technical reports describing the results of software testing, 10) Ability to provide technical support for resolution of anomalous satellite conditions, 11) Experience with software configuration management to maintain a complete library of operating software for all DMSP satellites and the complete support development documentation for the software, 12) Experience with testing of software modifications, 13) Ability to start Independent Verification and Validation work immediately upon contract award, 14) Direct experience with assembly language (DMSP legacy software code), 15) Experience using SCP-234 computers, 16) The contractor must possess or be able to obtain necessary security clearances.<br />Interested offerors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (PST), within 30 working (business) days after this announcement is posted demonstrating knowledge of IV&amp;V on Department of Defense (DoD) satellite programs of similar complexity, and have an understanding of the DMSP mission and future technology challenges, and provide the capabilities listed above. <br />The submission must also include an assessment of actual, potential, or perceptions of Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) with Lockheed Martin (software developer) through the submission of an OCI Mitigation Plan. The mitigation plan will be evaluated to ensure proper safeguards are implemented or will be implemented to protect the Government's interest and to identify perceptions of bias and unmitigable OCIs in accordance with FAR 9.5. OCIs can occur at any level; prime, subcontractor, or other types of teammates. Additionally, there are two underlying principles of OCI; 1) Conflicting roles that might bias or impair a contractor's judgment, and 2) Unfair competitive advantage (where a competing contractor has access to proprietary information of competitor(s) or has access to source selection information that is not available to all competitors). If no OCI, then the response needs to state that no actual, potential, or perceptions of OCI were identified. The OCI plans must also be in compliance with the current version of the SMC OCI checklist, attached and also available upon request from the contracting officer, Mr. Darren Fullo.<br />The SOC shall not exceed 20 one-sided pages in length. The page limit is for the SOC only and does not include the required OCI Mitigation Plan submission. Responses to the OCI Mitigation Plan must be submitted by e-mail in electronic form in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF format. All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font size no smaller than 12 point, and one-inch margins.</p>
<p>Submission of Responses:<br />Submit all synopsis responses to: SMC/PKW, Attn: Darren Fullo, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Bldg 272, Room C4-321, El Segundo, CA, 90245-2808. Electronic submissions can be submitted to Darren.Fullo@losangeles.af.mil.

<DESC>SUBJECT:   Case Mouth Sealants for 20mm Ammunition
The Army Contracting Command-Picatinny on behalf of the US ARMY ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking firms capable of making case mouth sealants for 20mm ammunition. The sealant is applied on the crimp groove of the steel projectile to prevent moisture from entering the brass cartridge case through the case mouth. After the sealant is applied to the projectile crimp groove by machine, the brass cartridge case is crimped to the projectile. Moisture that enters the cartridge case can contaminate the propellant and primer mix and degrade the performance of the ammunition.   
CAPABILITIES/EXPERIENCE:
Interested sources shall be capable of producing case mouth sealants that do not degrade at -65F and +160F.  The sealants shall have an optimal viscosity so that the sealants can be applied to the projectiles by production machine.  After the 20mm cartridges are made with the sealant, the cartridges will be subjected to rough handling during vehicle transportation and uploading and downloading the six-barrel Gatling gun.  Because of the rough handling in the field, the sealants shall have optimal adhesion and strength properties to prevent moisture intrusion in the cartridge case.   Prior experience in making case mouth sealants for military cannon ammunition is desirable.
Firms/companies are invited to indicate their interests and capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data as well as identification of current customers. All information is to be submitted via e-mail (10MB limit) at no cost or obligation to the Government; information provided will not be returned.  All responses shall be in the English Language. Responses shall also indicate the size of the business entity; large or small business.
Please provide name of your firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email only. Interested firms are encouraged to submit their capabilities / qualification data NO LATER THAN June 30, 2011.  Submittals and questions should be directed to the following point of contact: US Army Contracting Command, Attn. Phil Johnson, CCJM-JA, Bldg. 10, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000, email Philip.J.Johnson2@us.army.mil.  The Government will not be issuing a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) because this announcement will result in Blanket Purchase Agreement(s). In addition, the Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice.  
All interested and potential firms must be registered in CCR, and current firms must update once a year to maintain active status. Please visit the CCR website to register and update, https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx. Whether applying for assistance awards, contracts, or other business opportunities, all entities are considered "registrants". Registration in no way guarantees that a contract or assistance award will be awarded. The following information is required to register in CCR: DUNS Number; Tax Identification Number (TIN) and Taxpayers Name; Statistical Information about your business; and Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Information.

<DESC><p>C.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Summary<br />The Library of Congress needs to examine the current service and financial models supporting the production, sale, and distribution of the Library's cataloging products and services. A new strategic framework needs to be delineated that supports the Library's long range plans for future bibliographic and cataloging product development and access. It must account for the increasing provision of data for free (at no cost to the consumer), data that is currently provided on a cost-recovery basis through fee-based services. The framework must also address changes in technology, business trends, customer demand, costs, and revenue streams. The planning required must allow the Library to align its mission, services, and funding in a forward-looking manner that is responsive to the rapidly changing operating environment, and will allow the institution to reconfigure its services as necessary in a deliberate and financially sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>The Library wants to engage the services of a consultant to conduct a strategic planning effort that follows an analysis/design/implement methodology and provides a road map for the future distribution of its cataloging products and services.</p>
<p>Cataloging Distribution Service <br />The Office of Business Enterprises is responsible for the distribution of the Library's cataloging records and related standards, technical publications, and web-based resources to libraries, individuals, and businesses, nationally and internationally. <br />This data is sold and distributed through three core product lines:<br />&bull; Web-based products: Catalogers Desktop and Classification Web<br />&bull; Electronic products: cataloging data provided in a Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) format<br />&bull; Print products: paper-based versions of the data supplied via web-based and MARC products, ranging from the 9,000 page Library of Congress Subject Headings to leaflets<br />The business follows a cost plus 10% pricing model, and a subscription revenue model. Products are distributed directly to the customer via password access to web-based products (maintained by third-party vendors;) FTP and OAI/PMH for MARC products; and direct shipping of print products.</p>
<p>History of Product Development <br />The provision of Library of Congress cataloging products outside of the Library itself was established under 2 U.S.C. &sect; 150 in 1902 when the Library was given the authority by Congress to sell card indexes and other publications using a price schedule which would "cover their cost and ten per centum added." In providing this service, the Library was providing other entities with the benefit of its position as the nation's "library of record" helping to distribute standard cataloging data, standards, and policies.</p>
<p>The Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) grew in proportion with the Library's collections and the need to generate an ever growing number of catalog cards that were then distributed to other libraries and institutions. At its height in the 1960s, CDS was the Library's largest division with more than 600 staff and distributing 78 million cataloging cards each year.</p>
<p>The first large shift in CDS's product development came with the move from individual catalog cards to expansive cataloging print publications that provided easy reference to collections in the Library and in other collections. After the1960s, the Library began to make its cataloging data available through the creation of MARC data on magnetic tapes that were distributed to consortia and by them to other libraries who could then print their own cards. MARC grew in use as the data was made accessible as electronic files to anyone who had a computer, and MARC now leverages the opportunities associated with the web and metadata. The next significant shift in product development came with the introduction of web-based tools that now provide catalogers access to electronic manuals, cataloging and classification standards, procedures and resources, and allows users to browse and search the full text of the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) schedules and subject headings.</p>
<p>Business Environment <br />In planning its long-term strategy, the Library sees the need to be responsive to at least three significant stakeholders: the Library itself, the federal government, and the growing marketplace of cataloging content providers and buyers.</p>
<p>Over its history, the Library has set the standard for other libraries through its cooperative efforts to develop and support advances in library services and technologies. Today, the Library still plays a significant role in developing new ways to describe and provide access to information. As part of its strategic planning, the Library anticipates that users will have access to more content on more topics, in a wider range of formats, because cooperative programs will enable libraries to share the expense and workload of acquiring, describing, and analyzing collections. It also anticipates that rapidly changing technologies will change the ways cataloging data can be transmitted and utilized. Several initiatives are already in play that signal a change to the traditional cataloging distribution model. Most notably, the implementation of "Web Services" (http://id.loc.gov,) a registry that will eventually make available the major standards of the Library through open access. It is anticipated that data element values from Library supported metadata standards such as MARC, MODS, and PREMIS, the Thesaurus for Graphics Materials (TGM) and the Library's major code lists will be added to the registry. Much of this data, currently provided for a fee through BE's MARC distribution service (MDS) and print publications, would be freely available. The LCSH is an example of Library content now available to customers as a long-standing, fee-based print product, and as raw data for free via a SKOS format. It is this context that the Library wants to plan for the next significant transformative phase in the provision of its products and services.<br />The likelihood that the Library will generate more data in electronic format that can be freely disseminated online coincides with and complements the "Open Government" initiative. The Library is not bound by executive branch legislation, but it uses such legislation as guidelines in fulfilling its mission. The free provision of Library data online would complement the government-wide effort as defined in OMB Open Government Directive 2009. "To increase accountability, promote informed participation by the public, and create economic opportunity," the directive states, "each agency shall take prompt steps to expand access to information by making it available online in open formats...To the extent practicable and subject to valid restrictions, agencies should publish information online in an open format that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched by commonly used web search applications. An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information." <br />With the rapid expansion of digital technologies, software services, and web-based distribution, third parties are playing a growing role in an environment previously the reserve of the Library and few others. Today, the marketplace (as defined by categories that interact directly or indirectly with the Library's cataloging products) include content vendors and aggregators, commercial bibliographic utilities and service providers, software systems vendors, commercial and academic publishers, and non-commercial entities, cooperatives, and consortia. The Library needs to be responsive to this changing &lsquo;competitive' environment, not so that it can compete but so it can effectively adapt its approach to focus on its future role and better serve its mission in the years ahead. <br />C.2 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>C.2.1 The vendor shall incorporate all major stakeholders in the process of establishing a viable strategic and implementation plan to support the goal of adapting current products and services to a new business and financial model.</p>

<p>F. Proposal schedule<br />Vendors should submit their proposals by April 22, 2011.</p>
<p>G. Evaluation Factors for Award</p>
<p>G.1 Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Vendor selection will be based on evaluation of proposals in accordance with the responses received to the criteria outlined in the statement of work. Award will be made to that vendor whose combination of technical and price proposals represents the best value to the Government and is most advantageous, price and other factors considered. The technical factors are weighed more heavily than cost.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress also reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received and/or request for clarification or modification of proposals. The Library reserves the right to determine a competitive range for negotiation based upon the technical and cost acceptability of proposals. In addition, the Library reserves the right to award a contract without discussions.</p>
<p>Price evaluation will include an analysis of the total price/cost and cost elements (if applicable) to perform the required work. The total price/cost supplied by the vendor shall be submitted as a separate document and shall constitute the total firm-fixed unit price for that service or deliverable.</p>
<p>Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unreasonably low or high in cost or price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk involved in the contract requirements and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. Evaluation factors for award are listed below in descending order of importance:</p>
<p><br />G.2 Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Technical Factors. The acceptability of the technical proposal will be evaluated with respect to three (3) major factors. Technical factors are listed in descending order of importance. The technical proposal is worth more than the cost proposal; and when technical proposals are relatively equal in technical merit, cost will increase in importance.</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive of Technical Approach. The vendor's responses must be based on an adequate description and justification for the overall methodology for services as described in the statement of work. The vendor must understand the requirements and problems associated with the implementation of services required by the statement of work for the Library of Congress, including differing needs of various divisions, as well as other requirements needed to strike the appropriate balance between businesslike activities and the Library's mission and Congressional oversight.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance. The vendor shall provide evidence of experience from the last 3 years of the expertise called for in the statement of work. The vendor should provide at least 3 recent and relevant project examples, and at least one example should be used to illustrate how past performance has a bearing on the vendor's ability to successfully complete the Library's objectives.</p>
<p>(3) Staffing &amp; Project Management. The vendor's response must indicate evidence that their firm employs personnel capable of handling all phases of service as required by the statement of work. Vendor's response must address the quality, soundness, completeness and feasibility of the vendor's project approach, including quality of staff, utilization of staff, plan for continuity of operations, and interaction with Library staff.</p>
<p><br />H. Level of Effort<br />Contractor shall be required to provide the necessary staff with the appropriate skills to successfully complete all tasks described in Section 4 and within the period of performance mentioned in Section 5.</p>
<p>I. Key Personnel Requirements</p>
<p>I.1 Certain skilled experienced professional and/or technical personnel are essential for successful vendor accomplishment of the work to be performed under this contract. These are defined as "Key Personnel" and are those persons whose resumes will be submitted for evaluation of the proposal. The vendor agrees that such personnel shall not be removed from the contract work or replaced without compliance with F.2 and F.3.</p>
<p>I.2 If one or more of the key personnel for whatever reason becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract for a continuous period exceeding ten (10) work days, or is expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the proposal or initially anticipated, the vendor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and shall, subject to the concurrence of the Contracting Officer or his authorized representative, promptly replace such personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.</p>
<p>I.3 All requests for approval of substitutions hereunder must be in writing and provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions. They must contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute, and any other information requested by the Contracting Officer or needed by him/her to approve or disapprove the proposed substitution. The Contracting Officer or his authorized representative will evaluate such requests and promptly notify the vendor of his approval or disapproval thereof in writing.</p>
<p>I.4 If the Contracting Officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated or have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming or that the resultant reduction of productive effort would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the services ordered, the contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate, or, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer if he/she finds the vendor at fault for the condition. The contract price may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant delay, loss, or damage.</p>
<p><br />J. Government Furnished Items</p>
<p>J.1 Contractor personnel will have access to existing planning, financial, and technical documentation and subject matter experts as needed to perform successfully on the tasks described in Section 4.<br />If available, the government will furnish temporary work space when it is practical for the vendor to work on-site. The vendor will furnish their own PC capabilities, and communicate any additional needs to the Contracts Office.</p>
<p>K. Reporting &amp; Documentation Requirements</p>
<p>K.1 Meetings shall be convened on a weekly basis at the Library of Congress, or if this is not practical, by telephone to communicate status and activities. The Contractor will deliver meeting minutes within 2 working days of any meeting held with LC staff.<br />K.2 Status reports will be provided bi-weekly.<br />K.3 In-Process Review Meetings will be held bi-monthly. Agenda, attendees, time and location of the meeting will be coordinated with the COTR.<br />K.4 A project schedule will be created and delivered to the COTR within 10 working days of the kick-off meeting.<br />K.5 Deliverables will have a professional and consistent format across ALL deliverables. <br />K.6 The Contractor may develop additional documents which are not explicitly requested if the Contractor deems them to be useful in the successful completion of this SOW but the Contractor may not bill the Government for their development.<br />K.7 The document review process will allow the Government a maximum of 10 working days to conduct a review of the document and provide any changes to the Contractor. The Contractor will then be allowed a maximum of 5 working days to incorporate any changes to the document before submitting the document to the COTR for acceptance.<br />L. Travel</p>
<p>No travel is anticipated unless the Contractor determines that work can be done more expeditiously and cost effectively off site, and then periodic travel between the Contractor site and the Library of Congress, would be anticipated. It is not anticipated that the cost of this travel would be such that it would warrant an additional cost to the Government; therefore, cost associated with travel will not be paid by the Government.</p>
<p><br />Aligning Cost Recovery &amp; Pricing Schedules for Fee-Based Services at the Library of Congress <br />FY2011-12<br /><br />B.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Business Enterprises (BE) supports the programs of the Library of Congress by developing and enhancing the Library's fee-based services to the public by providing strategically targeted products and services that support and expand the Library's core activities and facilitates access to its collections.</p>
<p>These services are cost-recovery activities required to operate on a breakeven basis, with revenues expected to cover operational costs and the cost of future growth and unforeseen circumstances. This legislative requirement to recover costs places a premium on efficient business practices, establishing economies of scale, and reducing unnecessary and redundant cost.<br />BE needs to reexamine its current fee structures in the context of changing business trends, customer demands, and Library strategy so that it can re-align its operating costs with revenue generation, and plan for long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>B.2 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>B.2.1. BE wants consulting support to conduct an objective examination of its fee-based operations in order to develop a comprehensive assessment of cost-recoverable expenses, and the necessary recommended fee structure to allow revenue to cover costs.</p>
<p>B.2.2. The consultant will work with BE staff to analyze the current expenses of two (2) BE funds, the CDS fund and the PHOTO fund, by product line and/or by major product or product family, and recommend appropriate fee structures for the two (2) funds. The CDS business follows a cost plus 10% pricing model, and a subscription revenue model. Products are distributed directly to the customer via password access to web-based products (maintained by third-party vendors;) FTP for MARC products; and direct shipping of print products. The PDS business follows a cost plus pricing model, and a hybrid revenue model, combining custom orders and retail. Print and micrographic products are shipped directly to the customer, and digital products are distributed via FTP or CD.</p>
<p>B.2.3. The consultant will be required to recommend a user fee structure for recovering appropriate costs on a fiscal year basis; and provide a methodology for monitoring costs so that BE will be able to set fees in future fiscal years that will enable continued recovery of appropriate costs.</p>
<p>B.3. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>B.3.1. General Requirements</p>
<p>B.3.2 The contractor should be familiar with Federal Accounting Standards and with revolving fund and/or enterprises funds that allow expenditure accounts authorized by Congress to be credited with collections, primarily from the public, that are generated by, and earmarked to finance, a continuing cycle of business-type operations. The principal feature of an enterprise fund is its similarity in purpose to a commercial entity and it generally follows accrual accounting principles, including the recording of depreciation as expense. An enterprise fund is used when the cost of particular services is to be paid through usage charges designed to recover the cost, including depreciation. Also, an enterprise fund is used for products whose price is designed to recover the cost of production.</p>
<p>B.3.3 The contractor should become familiar with the two funds' business and financial models to ensure the formation of sound strategic and business assumptions for informing a new fee schedule and methodology. The BE/CDS fund is the legislative and budget authority behind the distribution of the Library's cataloging records and related standards, technical publications, and web-based resources to libraries, individuals, and businesses, nationally and internationally. Products include the Library of Congress Subject Headings, Library of Congress classification schedules, all of the MARC documentation, and two Web-based products Classification Web and Cataloger's Desktop. The BE/PDS fund is the legislative and budget authority behind the Library's reproduction services for a wide variety of rare and original materials sought after by researchers, by other libraries for their own collections, and by governments to enhance their own national resources. Products include photographic negatives and prints, photocopies, microform filming and duplication, and digital scanning and imaging, all reproduced in accordance with U.S. copyright law. <br />B.3.4 These operations are conducted under the organizational umbrella of BE, but are maintained as separate accounting entities in keeping with the legislation that established them as individual funds. The consultant must provide separate solutions that are specific to each fund's financial circumstances and needs. Recommendations for potential economies of scale and other cost-saving measures are welcome.<br />B.3.2. Special Requirements</p>
<p>B.3.2.1 Develop a project plan detailing the steps necessary to meet the above-stated objectives. This plan will describe the methodology used, specify milestones and enumerate deliverables.</p>
<p>B.3.2.2 Capture all cost-recoverable expenses associated with the CDS and PHOTO funds. Working with BE staff, review the operations and determine which cost-recoverable functions are essential to the work of the Library itself and which qualify as cost-recoverable services for the public.</p>
<p>B.3.2.3 Specify and apply appropriate costing methodologies to compute the direct and indirect costs for BE's CDS and PHOTO cost-recoverable functions, based on established Federal Cost Accounting Standards, with particular reference to inter-entity costs. Each inter-entity cost should include the full cost of goods and services that BE receives from other entities, such as support services from other Library of Congress program operations, and overhead charged by the Library for supporting services. To the extent possible, costs should be matched directly with outputs. When this is not possible, costs will be allocated by activity. Compute those costs following Federal Cost Accounting Standards.</p>
<p>B.3.2.4 Recommend a fee structure and the appropriate degree of recoverability of fees for services provided by the CDS and PHOTO funds that are deemed cost-recoverable based on the cost analysis. Each fee recommended should be based on the actual cost and value of the service to the Library and its public user communities, and should be consistent with the intent to provide mission based and valued-added products and services.</p>
<p>B.3.2.5 Provide a methodology for monitoring costs that BE will be able to use to establish costs and adjust fees in future fiscal years in accordance with the annual budget cycle and which will enable continued recovery of appropriate costs.</p>
<p>B.4 DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>B.4.1 The consultant shall prepare a planning document detailing the steps necessary to complete the task. The plan will be due to BE ten days following the signing of the agreement. The planning document that contains identification of the project's objectives, scope, and methodology; phase, performance or completion milestones; resources and communications plan; resource requirements and dependencies; and general assumptions or expectations..</p>
<p>B.4.2 The consultant shall prepare a draft and final report that computes the costs associated with the CDS and PHOTO functions deemed cost-recoverable under Federal Accounting Standards. The report will contain a detailed cost analysis showing allocated costs, cost relationships and the methodologies used in arriving at the applicable costs. BE will have ten days to review the draft and provide comments.</p>
<p>B.4.3 The consultant shall prepare a draft and final report describing all functions within BE's CDS and PHOTO funds, distinguishing between those that are cost-recoverable and those that are not inherently sustainable as currently configured. The report should provide a rationale for why each function is placed in a particular category, and recommendations on how they can be sustained by other fees within the same fund or by other funds. BE will have ten days to review and comment on the draft.</p>
<p>B.4.4 The consultant shall prepare a draft and final report that recommends an appropriate fee structure and the percentage of recoverability for services provided under the CDS and PHOTO funds. This fee structure should be consistent with the Library's mission and objectives. BE will have ten days to review the draft and provide comments.</p>
<p>B.4.5 The consultant shall prepare a final report detailing the methodology and procedures for measuring and reporting cost data for BE recoverable services. The report will include the following information:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Base line of existing business operations<br /><br />&bull; Strategic analysis of the business operations, identifying opportunities for improvements<br /><br />&bull; Recommendation for changes to the business model and/or processes to bring about improved cost accounting of BE's services<br />&bull; Methodology for monitoring and capturing cost information related to cost-recoverable fee services on a fiscal year basis.<br />&bull; Methodology for revising fees based on updated cost data<br />&bull; Recommended fee schedules for FY12 implementation</p>

<DESC>The current ERS contracts expire October - December 2016. Since dollar utilization has been faster than planned it is expected the full program amount will be utilized prior to expiration of the time periods of the ERS contracts. Based on this the government is starting the re-procurement process for ERS. There is currently no solicitation for this synopsis. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking information of potential small business and large business firms that have an interest in submitting a proposal as a prime contractor for this work. Information received in relation to this notice will be used to assist the government in developing overall acquisition strategy to include type and number of contracts and contract amount. The government is currently contemplating the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts on both a fixed price and cost reimbursement basis. In addition the government intends to award contracts both as Full and Open and SB Set-Asides.
<p>Description: The Environmental Remediation Services (ERS) contracts are used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, (USACE), Alaska District to execute environmental remediation projects in support of our customers. The Alaska District supports many different customers, several of whom rely exclusively on us to execute their environmental work. The Alaska District executes remediation services for multiple customers including the Army; Air Force; U.S. Forest Service; U.S. Coast Guard; Federal Aviation Administration; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Environmental Protection Agency; and Bureau of Land Management. In addition, the Alaska District executes a strong Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program. Our customers rely on the Alaska District to provide efficient, quality environmental services in harsh environments at remote locations with challenging logistics. This description is not all-inclusive and is intended only as a broad, general description. The ERS work includes investigations, studies, remedial designs, removal and remedial actions of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste (HTRW) contaminated soil and groundwater. The contractor shall also be prepared to conduct emergency responses under the National Contingency Plan. Emergency responses could involve responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges and releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>While the ERS work will primarily occur at various sites in Alaska, some work may occur regionally throughout the Pacific Ocean Division (POD). POD encompasses the entire Pacific Rim including Hawaii, Japan, Korea, Guam, and Indochina. The Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) is applicable for Korea and Japan. Decisions to place work outside Alaska will be based on a review of contractor's capability to do this work as well as the contractor's desire to perform it.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;NAICS Code for this effort is 562910 Environmental Remediation Services (size standard 500 employees). The period of performance will be 10 years with an estimated program amount of $490 million spread over all the contracts. The solicitation will issued as Requests for Proposals (RFP) using the Best Value Source Selection approach.</p>
<p>As stated above, the Government will use the information provided by interested offerors to determine our overall acquisition strategy. In response to this notice interested offerors should submit a capability statement (20 pages or less) in written format. The preferred method of response is via email to all&nbsp;Points of Contact (POC's) listed in this notice. Please insure your capability statement includes the following: (1) summarize how your company is uniquely capable and qualified to handle remediation services; (2) summarize projects completed similar to the projects outlined above. The list of relevant projects shall include the total cost and duration of the projects; (3) provide bonding capacity per contract and aggregate capacity; (4) Small Business status; (5) Capability and experience in doing cost reimbursement contracts; and (5) Experience and desire to perform work outside Alaska in the POD region. Capability Statements shall be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than the date and time listed in this notice.

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
IDIQ for base plus four option years of, Decimal Coded-Wire Fish Tags, Equipment, Automated Fish Marking Trailers, supplies and maintenance.
Vendor:
Northwest Marine Technology PO Box 427Shaw Island, Washington 98286

 The Columbia River Fisheries Program Office (CRFPO) has conducted a program to mark fish since the 1970s. Approximately 18 million fish are tagged or clipped each year in this "traditional" marking program. The Fisheries Program, Region 1 (CRFPO and Western Washington Fish and Wildlife Office), began operations in Fiscal Year 2005 of recent Congressional legislation that mandates mass marking of hatchery fish that are produced for the purpose of harvest. This mandate increased to approximately 32 million fish that will be tagged or clipped each year. The operations are conducted at state, federal, or tribal fish hatcheries throughout the Columbia Basin (Columbia and Snake rivers).
This proposed acquisition meets the requirements of the cited authority because Northwest Marine Technology (NMT) is the sole manufacturer and distributor of automated fish marking trailers, equipment, tags, and marking supplies. There are no other vendors of manual or automated adipose fin-clipping and coded wire tagging equipment. NMT automated systems are unique in their capability to automatically inject Coded Wire Tags (CWT) and excise adipose fins on juvenile salmonids.
Northwest Marine Technology can meet equipment, coded wire tags and supplies required in FY11 - FY16 to enable the Service to meet its traditional, ongoing marking program as well as fulfill the Congressional mandate of mass marking hatchery-reared salmonids.  The automated fish marking and tagging trailers are new, state-of-the-art equipment and technology. Operational features include adipose clip and tag (tagging on SCT model) of salmonids ranging from 57mm to 142mm total length; 60 thousand fish processed per shift with one skilled operator and four manual markers; sort up to seven different size categories; and no anesthetic required. The Marking and Fish Sorter systems include Windows controller with touch screen interface, UPS backup, report printing, and constant progress monitoring. The Marking system includes use of six patented Volitional Entry devices. The Fish Sorter includes seven size-sorting ports, and dual exit volitional entry device, water jet fish separation, and fish containment system. The AutoFish System is manufactured exclusively by Northwest Marine Technology and protected by U.S. patent (5,324,940). 
Other patented products/components for use in manual or automated marking include:  a) coded wire tags (CWTs) and CWT injection equipment. CWT detection equipment and parts and repair for injection and detection equipment are manufactured and distributed solely by NMT. Each group of tags is made for a specific agency containing a unique batch or individual code. NMT's tags, injection and detection equipment are protected by several U.S. patents (4955396, 4655396, 4753193, 5134370); b) the Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tagging system. The VIE utilizes a specially developed, biocompatible and medical grade elastomer material that provides externally visible, internal marks. The elastomer is injected as a liquid into tissue with a needle and then cures into a pliable solid. The elastomer material and the equipment to inject elastomer are manufactured by NMT and protected by U.S. patent (5,324,940); c) the Visible Implant Alphanumeric Tag. This is a pliable, fluorescent tag and has a coding scheme of three alphanumeric characters. This tag is manufactured by NMT and protected by U.S. patent (5,324,940). 
No other vendor is known to manufacture and distribute these or similar items.

<DESC><strong>THIS REPLACES&nbsp;THE ANNOUNCEMENT DATED MAY 19 ENTITLED EPA-RFI-MEETINGS.&nbsp; THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT.&nbsp; THE EARLIER DOCUMENT WAS ERRONEOUSLY DELETED FROM FEDBIZOPPS.&nbsp; THIS POSTING SIMPLY REPLACES THE DOCUMENT.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br /></strong>Conference, Event, and Meeting Support Services
<p><br /><strong>Purpose<br /></strong>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research and gather information from industry on conference, event, and meeting planning and support for EPA offices and regions across the country. The EPA's goal is to establish a strategic approach to acquiring and providing such services.</p>
<p>This RFI is solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotations (RFQ) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation. The U.S. Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission. The U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>Each year the EPA sponsors hundreds of conferences and events across the country. The majority of these events are in the 250 - 2,000 person range. These events are critical to the successful execution of the Agency's mission and act as a forum for collaborative problem solving as well as conveying essential information to a variety of audiences. Currently services for planning and executing these events are acquired in a variety of ways by individual offices and personnel across the Agency. EPA believes there is a more efficient and cost effective way to acquire these services.</p>
<p>Through this RFI, EPA is seeking input and suggestions from industry about conference, event and meeting planning and support services in order for EPA to make decisions about structuring a strategic acquisition solution for these services.</p>
<p>EPA seeks feedback from industry on the general description below as well as suggestions or other responses to help optimize the way EPA acquires these services. EPA also seeks responses to several specific questions listed after the description below.</p>
<p><strong>General Description <br /></strong>EPA envisions engaging several companies in the conference/event planning industry to help optimize current conference and event preparation and execution in order to minimize costs and maximize efficiency and attendee experience.</p>
<p>Issues and services that EPA envisions contractor(s) handling may include:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing event planning and coordination services<br />&bull; Identifying and securing event facilities, audio-visual support, supplies and equipment <br />&bull; Identifying and securing event speakers<br />&bull; Identifying and securing lodging for participants<br />&bull; Identifying and arranging for appropriate food or refreshments as allowed by federal regulation<br />&bull; Providing program/agenda support <br />&bull; Providing registration and related on-site support<br />&bull; Providing document preparation support <br />&bull; Providing graphic support and photography<br />&bull; Creating and managing an on-line interface for EPA offices to review available options, choose from a variety of services, and perform information exchanges electronically.<br />&bull; Providing on-line participant registration<br />EPA further envisions contracting with companies that understand Federal regulations, protocols and issues affecting Federal conference/event management, including:<br />&bull; Federal travel regulations <br />&bull; The Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />&bull; Green meeting best practices and requirements (e.g., GSA Guidance for Sustainable TDY Policies and Practices www.gsa.gov/graphics/ogp/FTRbulletin10-06.doc, EPA Green Meetings and Conferences http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/octqtr/48cfr1523.703-1.htm, etc.) <br />&bull; Remote meetings<br />&bull; Regulations and policies concerning registration, refreshments and other relevant areas (for example, see Attachments 1 and 2). <br />&bull; Fee-based conferences or similar "no cost" arrangements in accordance with section 5.B of EPA Order #1900-3 (see Attachment 1).<br />Questions for Industry<br />As part of its market research EPA is requesting industry input on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Please discus the positive and negative aspects of creating a single over-arching contract vs. multiple contract vehicles. Please be advised that we believe that this service lends itself to developing a strategic sourcing acquisition solution.</p>
<p>2. Please discuss the challenges associated with planning and executing conferences/events of a small, medium and large nature.</p>
<p>3. In the conferencing/event planning arena, what are the typical demographics (size standard, socio-economic categories, geographic location and coverage) for companies that perform this type of work?</p>
<p>4. Please discuss the specific issues that would make a solicitation for this work especially desirable -- or undesirable -- to companies considering competing for the work.</p>
<p>5. Please discuss standard industry practices, and your company's best practices, in providing these services.</p>
<p>6. Please discuss any effective performance-based results associated with providing these services of which you might be aware.</p>
<p>7. Please discuss options for maximizing green meeting and events (e..g, ASTM/APEX Green Meetings and Events Standard, Convention Industry Council's Accepted Practices Exchange Panel on Green Meeting and Event Practices, the Green Meeting Industry Council, etc.)</p>
<p>8. Optional: Attached please find a sample EPA event (see Attachment 3). Please provide your ideas on how to plan and execute this sample event.</p>
<p>9. Please provide any other information you think EPA might find useful in competing and acquiring these services.<br />How to Respond</p>
<p>Please provide all responses to this Request for Information no later than June 3, 2011 in electronic or hardcopy format to Ms. De'borah Sissine at:</p>

<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541380, Testing Laboratories. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in performing physical, chemical, and other analytical testing services, such as acoustics or vibration testing, assaying, biological testing (except medical and veterinary), calibration testing, electrical and electronic testing, geotechnical testing, mechanical testing, nondestructive testing, or thermal testing. The testing may occur in a laboratory or on-site. The size standard for NAICS 541380 is $12.0M. Comments on this NAICS Code and suggestions for alternatives must include supporting rationale. <br />No decision has yet been made regarding the acquisition strategy for this requirement. Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS code. The government is interested in all small businesses, including 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that are interested in performing this requirement. The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business).

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br />HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)<br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).&nbsp; 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).<br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,&nbsp; modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at <a href="http://www.dol">http://www.dol</a>. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at <a href="http://wdol.gov/">http://wdol.gov/</a>.

During increased Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs), entry requirements to the installation may change with little to no notice. During FPCON Charlie, contractors without a "C" on their CAB may be denied access. Depending on the incident or threat, all personnel to include contractors may be denied access to the installation for safety/security reasons.<br />(I) Contractors are subject to spot checks or inspections of their vehicles and personal items at entry control points or facility access points during higher threats or during random antiterrorism measure checks. Failure to comply with these added security measures may result in denial of access to the installation.<br />(II) Contractors are encouraged to receive Antiterrorism Awareness Training annually available at no cost, but it is not required in CONUS. Installation, Mission Element or the Unit Antiterrorism Representative (ATR) can provide this training when requested. Contractors can play an important role in protecting the installation and are encouraged to report suspicious activity to Security Forces by either calling 911 during emergencies or 333-2000. <br />(ii) Operations Security (OPSEC): As applicable based on the scope and nature of the contract, the contractor shall comply with Government OPSEC guidance and training as prescribed in AFI 10-701, Operations Security, Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1 and AFI 33-332, Privacy Act, for handling of For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and HQ 10 ABW/CC Memorandum, USAFA Operations Security (OPSEC) Policy.

If this contract requires that any of the contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check. Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process. <br />(ii) Convictions. Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of access or removal of the employee from the effort under this contract. For felony convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the contractor may recommend the employee be retained on the contract.

If during the course of the CABs processing, any contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding a warrant.<br />(iv) Barment. Employees removed by the CO may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA. <br />(I) Barment appeals are processed through 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(II) Individuals have 30 days from the date of the initial contractor access denial letter to submit a justification in writing to 10 SFS/S5B, along with any notarized copies of court documents or other documents they determine necessary to rebut the disqualifying information.<br />(III) In the case of a barment based on an outstanding warrant, the contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. <br />(IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee's use on this contract until the case is resolved. <br />(V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(b) See USAFA implementation procedures below.<br />(1) Added: The contractor shall submit a letter to the CO specifying contractor personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form 111, Application for Personnel and Vehicle Pass to Work Under Air Force Contract. The contractor shall submit a USAFA Form 111 on each contractor employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract. All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass and Registration Center (PRC). CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days. If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass. CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year. <br />(2) Added: The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing. Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor's employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained. The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.<br />(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.<br />(1) Added: CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.<br />(2) Added: Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving their employment on a contract.

The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111. The CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor's original letter to PRC. By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. All technically acceptable offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The evaluation process will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106 using the following process. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate approximately 2-3 of the lowest priced quotes for technical acceptability, if applicable, and price reasonableness starting with the lowest priced offer. If none of the three lowest priced offers are found to be acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated, and the process will continue until 2 or more offers are found to be technically acceptable. If after reviewing all offers, only one is found to be technically acceptable, the contractor may be required to ask the offeror to supply more information to make a price fair and reasonable determination. Offers will receive a technical rating of either acceptable or non-acceptable. <br />Step 3. Assess performance confidence for 2-3 of the lowest priced technically acceptable offerors utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionnaires, PPRIRS, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. A technical review will be accomplished on all offer: a) to ensure offered product meets all product specifications and requirements of the solicitation b) to ensure products will meet the compatibility needs of the governments, and c) to assess quality of offered products. Offers will receive a technical rating of either ACCEPTABLE or NON-ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>e. The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest of the government. <br />(End of Addendum)</p>

Place of performance is Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Inspection, acceptance and F.O.B. are at destination, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Delivery shall be no later than 20 calendar days after award date.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-50. A redacted copy of the required brand-name justification is included within this announcement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is set-aside exclusively for small business concerns, and the associated NAICS code is 541511 with a SBA size standard of $25 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a price for each contract line item number (CLIN) in their quote. Quotes with quantities different than requested or products other than those requested will be deemed technically unacceptable. Please provide your best and final offer (BAFO) as the Government does not intend to conduct negotiations.</p>

<p>Redacted Justification: The initial procurement investigated thirty eight asset management applications but narrowed the field to only four viable options based on our evaluation criteria which were (1) Acquisition-Supports the contracting life cycle of an asset from purchase thru retirement of the asset as well as software license tracking throughout the life cycle of the software; (2) Supported our operating systems-Solaris, Windows, MAC, and Linux; (3) provided features such as searching inside PDFs, customized reports, and document upload (4) Security- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Active Directory groups control as well as support for STIG compliance. Upon further research, we could only confirm after testing within our in-house lab that the Altiris Asset Management product fully supported our evaluation criteria. It was also the only product that included a STIG module within their suite of products. Finally, maintaining the current software in place is more cost effective than purchasing and implementing alternative software.</p>
<p>Potential offeror shall be an authorized Symantec Corporation partner and source directly through Symantec, or Symantec authorized channels only, per standard commercial industry practices. Quotes that do not meet this requirement shall be considered technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation factor(s) for award is; lowest-price, technically acceptable. Any resulting contract or order will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Place "SP4707-11-Q-0043" in the subject field of any e-mail correspondence. Questions regarding this RFQ are due by April 25, 2011 at 1:00 PM EST. Responses are due by April 27, 2011 at 4:00 PM EST. Please include your Cage Code with your quote. Questions and/or quotations may be submitted by e-mail to David Stemple, the primary point of contact for this announcement, at david.stemple@dla.mil, or by FAX: (269) 961-4226.</p>

<p>The following is the Statement of Work (SoW):</p>
<p>A. Background Information:</p>
<p>The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR)/Bldg. 235 at the Gaithersburg, MD facility has (2) road barrier stations. One station has two 12' L hydraulic pop-up road barriers (Nasatka Model III-b, installed in 2003) and the other station consists of (1) 14' L electric pop-up road barrier (Nasatka Model IIIB-E, installed in 2010). The electric barrier is equipped with the variable frequency drive option. Each station has a lockable master control panel, ground loop detectors, snow melting heaters, and each barrier has its own traffic light (red &amp; yellow) and gate arm.</p>
<p>The barriers have two modes of operation: normal with a raise time of 5 seconds and emergency with a raise time of 2 seconds. In either mode of operation the traffic light changes from yellow to red and the gate arm lowers. The raised barrier height is 33" above the ground and lowered barrier heights are &frac34;" above the ground for the hydraulic barriers and flush with the ground for the electric barrier. The barriers are normally down and are only operated once per week for testing purposes only. The average run time is less than 1000 hrs./yr.</p>
<p>To ensure continuous operation of the road barriers, it is essential that a routine program of inspection, maintenance and emergency repair services be established and followed. The hydraulic barriers have been under a service agreement from July 2006 through July 2011. Both barrier stations are currently being equipped to be remotely controlled from two locations inside Bldg. 235. Servicing the remote control equipment shall also be included in this maintenance contract.</p>

<p>***END OF STATEMENT OF WORK***</p>
<p>***EVALUATION FACTORS***</p>
<p>TECHNICAL</p>
<p>The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation is the most highly rated, and conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, non-price and price factors considered. NIST reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or to the offeror ranked highest technically, if it determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a single award but reserves the right to make multiple awards or make no award as a result of this RFQ.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial quotation should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any and or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest price quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotation received.</p>
<p>Non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Subfactors 1-3 are of equal importance. The relative importance of price will increase with the degree of evaluated equality of the technical factors.</p>
<p>NIST will evaluate quotations using the following factors and subfactors:</p>
<p>SubFactor 1 Technical Capability</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate its ability to meet the Government's requirement (e.g., capabilities/qualifications statement); and, specifically: a) having a demonstrated competence in servicing remotely controlled hydraulic and electric road barrier stations; and, b) evidence that OEM parts/componentry are supplied for all maintenance/repairs in order to ensure the stations continue to operate according to original specifications</p>
<p>***Technical Capability - the Government will evaluate the offeror's technical capability to conducting the maintenance services discussed in the SoW to determine its ability to service remotely controlled road barrier stations and furnish OEM parts/components.</p>
<p>SubFactor 2 Key Personnel/Experience</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide the resume/training certificate of its proposed key personnel that demonstrates experience in delivering services described in the SoW.</p>
<p>***Key Personnel/Experience - the Government will evaluate the extent to which the resume/training certificate submitted for the offeror's proposed key personnel demonstrate they have appropriate qualifications, and experience to efficiently and effectively conduct the required maintenance services.</p>
<p>SubFactor 3 Quality Control Plan</p>
<p>In terms of the approach for maintaining the equipment and complying with response times.</p>
<p>***Quality Control Plan - the Government will evaluate the extent to which the proposed Quality Control Plan ensures the remotely controlled road barrier stations are continuously operational and emergency repair calls comply with designated response times.</p>
<p>Past Performance/References</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide at least three examples of past performance conducted within the last three years of contracts of relevant work of a similar type and scope as the current requirement with federal, state or local governments and/or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance it should include a statement to that effect in its proposal. The government reserves the right to consider past performance data obtained from sources other than those provided by the offeror in its proposal.</p>
<p>The description of each reference described in this section shall not exceed a half page. For each of the contracts, the offeror shall provide the following information: <br />&bull; Contract number<br />&bull; Client's name and address<br />&bull; Dollar value<br />&bull; Period of performance<br />&bull; Narrative describing the requirement and its relevance to the current requirement<br />&bull; Name of contracting officer or point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address</p>
<p>The offeror may include: a) past performance information regarding any problems encountered on the contracts described above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems; and b)Any quality awards or certifications, letters of appreciation, commendations, industry recognition of excellence or special awards received with respect to performance of services. The offeror shall describe when the award, certification, etc. was received, and may provide as an attachment to this part.</p>
<p>***Past Performance - the Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance in the past three years</p>
<p>PRICE</p>
<p>Firm, fixed-price, quarterly in-arrears rate, for the required maintenance services</p>
<p>***Price - the Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed prices to determine whether the proposed prices comply with the instructions articulated above and are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed prices shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotation.</p>

<DESC>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br />
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NRMJ1000-11-02933WGC.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51.</p>
<p>(IV) This solicitation is open to all businesses. NAICS Code is 326111.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items:<br />Line Item 0001: 36 Extreme Cold Weather Plastic High Altitude Balloons for use at South Pole.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />BACKGROUND:<br />Research by the Global Monitoring Division (GMD) has been critical in determining the degree of the depletion of stratospheric ozone and the trends of the compounds causing this depletion. GMD determines the vertical extent of depletion over Antarctica (the ozone hole) through the use of high altitude balloons carrying ozonesondes. The plastic balloons are necessary to reach the required height in extreme cold conditions.  The entire lot of balloons must be shipped together since logistical support for the South Pole Station is suspended for 9 months due to weather conditions. The balloons are stored outside where ambient temperatures can reach -80 C. It is imperative that the balloons are not defective and able to reach the required height since replacement shipments are not possible. GMD is required by the Clean Air Act - 1990 to fulfill this mission requirement and must have a reliable balloon to perform these critical measurements in extreme conditions.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:<br />1.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Statement of Work<br />NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR Shipyard Package<br />NCND6000-11-02931</p>
<p>A. GENERAL INFORMATION<br />This Statement of Work contains the requirements for shipyard repairs to the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701. The contractor must be located within a reasonable transit distance from the vessel's home port in Monterey, CA, generally within 12-14hrs.</p>
<p>All work is to be accomplished at the contractor's facility. NOAA will deliver the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 to the contractor's facility. Delivery of the vessel back to the Government shall be at the contractor's facility. Because the vessel is in high demand, scheduled far in advance, and must also be available for emergency response activities with minimal downtime, the repair work must be conducted in the following time periods:</p>
<p>June 13 - July 9, 2011: All Phase One Tasks - Vessel Alongside<br />November 5-30, 2011: All Phase Two Tasks - Vessel Hauled</p>
<p>The government at its discretion may allow Phase Two Tasks to be conducted during the June 13 - July 9, 2011 time frame after the contractor has certified they can complete ALL work during that time window. The vessel must be ready for service no later than July 9, 2011</p>
<p>NOAA employees may be working on board NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 during the contract performance period on a not to interfere basis. During this period it will be required that NOAA Employees and NOAA contractors have full access to the NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 during normal working hours.</p>
<p>Coordination of the work schedules will be the responsibility of the Contractor to avoid any delays or disruptions in order to meet the aforementioned performance period.</p>
<p>The following is general information:<br />Length overall: 67 feet <br />Beam: 24.5 feet<br />Draft: 6.1 feet<br />Displacement: 49 long tons <br />Construction: Aluminum</p>
<p>Upon arrival and the initial securing of mooring lines to the Contractor's dock, the contractor will accept full responsibility for the safety of the vessel (including but not limited to fire protection, watch-standing, security patrols, water-tight integrity, protection from the environment, etc.). This responsibility will terminate only after all work defined herein (or added during the work period) is complete, accepted by NOAA, and NOAA personnel remove the mooring lines from the Contractor's dock.</p>
<p>All work performed under this SOW will meet or exceed all current requirements of ABYC and USCG (Subchapter T) as applicable to this size and type of vessel, in addition to any specific requirements stated below.</p>
<p>B. PHASE ONE VESSEL ALONGSIDE WORK - SPECIFICATIONS/TASKS</p>
<p>1. Revise the head sole covering:<br />The head sole covering (Londeck #776) is lifting in places. Remove the existing covering material and adhesives completely (Lonseal #300 Epoxy Adhesive). Abrade the aluminum deck (head area only) surface to clean, bare metal. Install a ~&frac12;" high rounded lip under the head door to prevent water from leaving the space. Apply a coating of epoxy sealer to the entire deck surface, and over-coat this with nonskid paint equal to that on the exterior decks.</p>
<p>2. Revise the anchor rode:<br />With vessel captain or crew in attendance, inspect the anchor rode for a fair lay on the drum when stowed. Unspool the rode and reposition the connection between the &frac12;"wire rope and thimble to the 3/8"chain to alleviate any unfair lay on the drum. Rewind the rode completely and inspect to ensure proper placement of the connection. Repeat the steps above if required. (Images to be provided upon request).</p>
<p>3. Generator softpatch hatch revisions:<br />Remove the two hatches located over the generators, and clean all old sealant away. Remove deck paint from with 3" of each hatch opening on both the deck and the hatches. Weld a 3/16" x 2" aluminum flat bar flange around the perimeter of each hatch, using a continuous, non-oscillated watertight weld bead of ~1/8" throat thickness on upper and lower sides. Carry welds across miter-joints in the corners so the flanges are completely sealed to the hatches. Reinstall the hatches and weld the outer edge of the new flanges to the deck surface using the same weld criteria as above. NOTE: It is the intent that if these hatches have to be removed in the future, the weld bead on the deck will be cut with a saw. Therefore, the straightness and uniformity of the weld bead on the deck surface is important. Test all welds after completion to prove watertight integrity by inspection from below.</p>
<p>4. Install GFM galvanic isolator:<br />Install a GFM recessed galvanic isolator (Guest Amp) in the main cabin aft bulkhead as directed by the government's representative. Provide and install a shore power circuit breaker next to the galvanic isolator. Install the indicator panel for the galvanic isolator. Position the shore power circuit breaker and isolator panel on the forward side of the main cabin aft bulkhead so they are visible from the labs space. Test the galvanic isolator and breaker after installation to prove proper functioning. Clearly label the function of the breaker and indictor light.</p>
<p>ABYC Galvanic Isolator Installation Requirements:<br />&bull; 28.7.1 The galvanic isolator shall be connected in series with the shore power cable AC grounding conductor (green or green with yellow stripe) in a manner that no other ground conductor will bypass the isolator back to the shore power ground (see A-28 Figure 1).<br />&bull; NOTE: In some Community Antenna TV (CATV) systems, there is a possibility of bypassing the galvanic isolator through connection of additional CATV equipment (e.g., amplifier splitters, computer equipment, etc.). Additional isolation may be required on shielded connections.<br />&bull; 28.7.2 All AC power inlets and all telecommunication inlets (e.g., cable, phone, etc.) shall be electrically isolated from hull and deck, if conductive, and wired so that no part of the grounding system bypasses the isolator.<br />&bull; 28.7.3 The current rating of the galvanic isolator shall not be less than the rating of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker as installed per ABYC E-11, AC &amp; DC Electrical Systems on Boats.<br />&bull; 28.7.4 The galvanic isolator shall be installed in a ventilated, dry and accessible location not to exceed the temperature rating of the unit.<br />&bull; 28.7.5 The status monitor shall be installed in an accessible location.<br />&bull; 28.7.6 Status monitor indicator(s) for the galvanic isolator shall be visible when operating the AC system.<br />&bull; 28.7.7 If the status monitor is installed in a location where it will be subjected to rain or spray the enclosure shall have a rating of IP64 or NEMA 4X.<br />&bull; 28.7.8 Conductor(s) shall be supported and/or clamped to relieve strain within six inches of the isolator</p>
<p>ABYC Shore Power Circuit Breaker Requirements:<br />&bull; 11.10.2.8.3 Additional Overcurrent Protection - If the location of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker is in excess of 10 feet (three meters) from the shore power inlet or the electrical attachment point of a permanently installed shore power cord, additional fuses or circuit breakers shall be provided within 10 feet (three meters) of the inlet or attachment point to the electrical system of the boat. Measurement is made along the conductors. <br />&bull; 11.10.2.8.3.1 If fuses are used in addition to the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker, their rating shall be such that the circuit breakers trip before the fuses open the circuit, in the event of overload. The ampere rating of the additional fuses or circuit breaker shall not be greater than 125% of the rating of the main shore power disconnect circuit breaker. For 120-volt service, both the grounded and ungrounded current carrying conductors shall be provided with this additional over-current protection.</p>
<p>5. Revise RAM lights on mast:<br />The existing RAM lights (red, white, red) on the mast are blocked from view in certain quadrants. Install a second set of lights, identical to those existing, approximately 12" to 18" directly forward of the current set. Fabricate all brackets required to adequately support the new lights, and secure these brackets with mechanical fasteners or welds. Wire the new lights so they operate simultaneous with the existing set. Note that some of the existing RAM lights are on separate circuits, and the new lights must be wired the same. If required, upgrade the circuit breakers to handle the higher electrical load. Upon completion, test all lights to ensure proper visibility and function. (Images provided upon request).</p>
<p>6. Repair hydraulic leaks at reservoirs:<br />Drain tank, completely disassemble suction piping, replace MPT adapters installed in suction strainer and at pump end of line with JIC fittings of same internal diameter. Replace existing hose with similar hose with JIC swivel fittings on each end (one straight, one 90 degree). This will be a custom hose. Reassemble, use Loctite 545 at pipe threads. Assemble JIC threads dry or with copper flare inserts if fitting manufacturer recommends.</p>
<p>C. PHASE TWO VESSEL HAULED WORK - SPECIFICATIONS/TASKS</p>
<p>1. Drydock, cleaning, inspection, undock:<br />The vessel shall be lifted in a drydock; marine railway; or by travel lift rated for 60 tons or greater. The vessel shall be blocked without list or trim. The vessel shall not be lifted by a sling or crane which does not allow for even, vertical support of the entire vessel. There are strap marks indicated by orange triangles imprinted on the exterior vessel to mark lifting locations. See NOAA Research Vessel FULMAR R-6701 Drawing 800-001B "Docking Plan" to plan for lifting requirements.<br />1.1 Submittals<br />A. Signed by a qualified independent firm attesting that the drydock; travel-lift; or railway, and associated controls and machinery, are in good sound condition and have adequate capacity to safely drydock the vessel. The certification shall be based on a visual inspection of the facility within the 12-month period immediately preceding the scheduled drydocking, operating and maintenance records of the facility, and recent demonstration of the facility's capacity (e.g., record of the largest vessel drydocked during the preceding 6 months).<br />B.

Number of days underway since last docking.<br />E. Paint history for last complete painting.<br />F. History of touch-up painting.<br />G. Tank sounding report.<br />H. List of any relevant data for any alterations accomplished on the vessel which may affect the docking operations but are not shown on the docking drawing.<br />I. Data for use in carrying out stability calculations from Ship's Damage Control Book and Booklet of General Plans.<br />1.4 Drydocking<br />A. After obtaining the consent of government's representatives, carefully haul-out the vessel without strain or injury, in a drydock; a travel lift; or marine railway. If any tendency to strain or injure the ship is observed, immediately re-float the vessel and rearrange the blocks/slings or make other corrections required to relieve the condition. <br />B. As the extremity of the vessel first to enter the dock reaches the dock sill, and the vessel is pointed fair for entering the drydock; marine rail; or vertical lift platform, the Contractor's Dock Master relieves the vessel's Operator in Charge of responsibility for the safety of the vessel. At this point, the Contractor's Dock Master also relieves NOAA of the operational control of the vessel.<br />C. Contractor's Dock Master shall center the vessel on the keel blocks, using centering bobs, sighting battens and other appropriate equipment. The vessel shall be kept centered over the keel blocks during the pumping down or raising operations. <br />D. Contractor's Dock Master shall direct the pumping out or lifting operations. It is mandatory to use divers during certain circumstances, such as when: <br />&bull; Docking drawing is in question;<br />&bull; Vessel is damaged;<br />&bull; Blocks are suspected of being damaged or moved during docking;<br />&bull; Contractor's adherence to the docking drawing is in question.<br />E. Shores, when used, shall be placed in position only after the vessel has landed fore and aft, but prior to the vessel reaching its draft at instability. Should a shore buckle, the Contractor's Dock Master shall stop pumping or raising operations, set up the next shore, and replace the buckled shore. <br />F. Contractor's Dock Master shall note the drafts on the vessel and observe that the vessel lands at the proper points with respect to the draft. Record the fore and aft draft mark readings of the vessel prior to drydocking and after undocking.<br />G. The Contractor's Dock Master shall stop the drydock pumps or raising of the vertical lift platform, and, if necessary, re-flood the dock or lower the platform in case:<br />&bull; The ship takes an undue list when landing;<br />&bull; The ship lands before the water has dropped to the proper depth;<br />&bull; A shore buckles (buckled shores shall be replaced);<br />&bull; government's representative observes any unsafe operations or operations that may endanger the vessel. <br />H. Installation of gangways and service lines shall be deferred until after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position. If a gangway is needed promptly, it may be suspended by a crane during the pumping down or raising operations. Service lines shall be promptly installed after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position. The Contractor shall provide the mooring lines, government owned mooring lines are not to be used.<br />I. As soon as possible, after the vessel has landed and side blocks are in position, a grounding cable or grounding strap shall be attached between the vessel and dock to protect the ship from the effects of electric storms and welding.<br />J. The government's representative or his/her Representative and the Contractor's Dock Master shall remain on site until the dock is pumped out sufficiently to permit personal examination of all blocks. Any irregularities found shall be corrected and any necessary shoring shall be placed before the government's representative and the Contractor's Dock Master leave the dock or the vertical lift facility until the facility is raised sufficiently to permit personal examination of all blocks and correction of any irregularities found. In all such cases, the docking crew shall likewise remain at the facility to assist as needed. The dock basin shall be washed down to remove silt, mud, and debris immediately after the vessel is drydocked.<br />1.5 Action After Docking<br />A. As soon as practical, but in all cases within 2 hours after drydocking the vessel, clean the entire underwater hull and boot-topping shall be cleaned of marine growth, dirt, and loose paint using stiff brushes, scrapers, and high pressure (minimum of 3000psi) fresh water. Included shall be sea strainer plates, sea chests, bow thrusters, rudders, propellers, shafts, struts, and other underwater hull appendages.<br />B.

<p>9. Correct science winch hydraulics/controls:<br />The Markey COM-7 science winch aboard exhibits a jerky drum movement when handling some loads at some speeds. This problem may be indicative of a fault wither with the winch drum drive, the vessels hydraulic system, or with the winch controls. In either case, the contractor will determine the cause of this problem, and resolve it using the following process: <br />A] The contractor will assemble a temporary hydraulic control valve (rotary or linear handle) and jumper hoses to allow testing of the science winch underway while bypassing the existing control valve. The temporary valve will allow the same pressure and flow at the winch as the existing valve.<br />B] Prior to docking the vessel, the contractor will test the winch underway with the existing control valve under different loads and at different line speeds. The test will be repeated with the temporary valve, and any differences in performance (specifically the smoothness of operation when the automatic brake in applied) will be noted. NOAA personnel will operate the vessel and control the winch when underway. The contractor will provide, load aboard, and unload a selection of weights from 50# to the maximum rated capacity of the winch for test purposes.<br />C] The contractor will discuss the winches performance observed during step B above with the manufacturer, and attain their agreement on 1] additional trouble-shooting procedures, <br />and/or 2] resolution of the problem.<br />D] After determining the proper resolution, he contractor will revise, tune, or replace winch, control, or hydraulic system components to allow smooth winch drum operation at all rated loads at all rated speeds.<br />E] The contractor will test the winch after the vessel undocks and demonstrate correct operation of the winch. NOAA personnel will operate the vessel and control the winch when underway.</p>
<p>D. IT SECURITY REQUIREMENT <br />The Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) requirements of Clause 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.</p>
<p>E. AWARD BASIS <br />Performance factors are equal to price. Contractor must demonstrate past performance in working with aluminum vessels including aluminum welding.<br />For excessively long transits from the vessels home port (greater than 14hrs one way), the government at its discretion may consider the cost for transit including crew, fuel, &amp; consumables in its basis for award. <br />F.

This chemical colloid stabilized emulsion has been specifically formulated for sealing asphalt parking lots, city streets, county roads, airport taxiways, and airport parking aprons. GSB-88 provides a durable, yet flexible top coat, while special plasticizers and oils penetrate and rejuvenate asphalt pavements. The result is an emulsified sealer/binder that restores vital components to asphalt pavements lost during the aging and oxidation process. The gilsonite seal provides a long wearing anti-oxidative seal for the surface of the asphalt pavement. GSB-88 beautifies asphalt pavements by drying to an absolute black color.

52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The factors are listed in order of importance. Non-price evaluation factors, when combined, would be significantly more important than Price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  

(I) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT 
(II) PAST PERFORMANCE 
(III) PRICE 

The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)

Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
 Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate past performance as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 

For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.
 

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. 

(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures, drawings or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.
 Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

(c) Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has an acceptable record of past performance. A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction.
 Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. 

Offers that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any Offerors proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government. Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.
 Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.
 Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

Delivery shall be no later than 90 days after receipt of order.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes will be accepted via email at lenette.santana@navy.mil. Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. 

This announcement will close at 12:00 PM PST on 28 June 2011. Contact Lenette Santana who can be reached at 805-982-2193 or email lenette.santana@navy.mil. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

<p><strong>A. Required Operational Standards<br /></strong>The two (2) new Intelligent Inserter Systems must meet or exceed the following operational standards:</p>
<p>1. The system must have a means of feeding cut sheets in both 8.5 x 11 and 8.5 x 14-inch sizes. At a minimum the feeder must accommodate both 20lb and 24lb paper weights.</p>
<p>2. In read mode the system must have a means of reading a 30 character Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code printed on each sheet. The system must use a bar code that is 100% compatible with existing Gunther systems i.e., EP057, S3024, and EP077. The decoded bar code values must be transmitted to the system controller for action. The controller software will use the bar code information to assemble the package, discern single or multiple flights, verify the package integrity, add inserts as necessary, and record the unique ID number on system hard disk in an ASCII text file. The file must include any error codes associated with the assembly of each package. The system hardware / software must provide a means of producing error free packages 100% of the time. Two supplemental feeders will need to have match feed capability.</p>
<p>3. The software must provide a non-read mode as well, in which the main feeder processes a preset number of sheets per machine cycle. The software must also provide an "inserts only mode in which the main feeder and folder are not used. The entire contents of the package will come from the supplemental feeders.</p>
<p>4. The system must have a means of accumulating the sheets into sets prior to stitching and/or folding.</p>
<p>5. The system shall include a means of stitching multi-page packages prior to folding. It must be capable stitching both 8.5 x 11 and 8.5 x 14-inch size documents in landscape and portrait orientations.</p>
<p>6. The system must have two means of accumulating the sets into packages prior to inserting. Option 1 sets are accumulated prior to the addition of any supplemental inserts; option two sets are accumulated after the addition of supplemental inserts.</p>
<p>7. The system must have a means of folding the sheets into half folds, C folds, and Z folds. The folder must be able to fold from one to fifteen sheets when set for half folds, from one to eight sheets for C folds, and one to six sheets for Z folds. It must do this without requiring adjustments to accommodate the varying paper thickness per file.</p>
<p>8. The system must have a means of adding up to four discrete supplement inserts to each package. The supplemental insert station must be capable of handling pieces ranging in size from 2x4 to 11x8.5 inches, and thickness from .006 to .25 inches. Each insert station must have a means of detecting miss feeds and double feeds. Stations must be capable of functioning properly at system's full rated speed.</p>
<p>9. The system must have a means of feeding the outside envelopes ranging in size from 4 x 6 to 10 x 13 inches.</p>
<p>10. The system must be able, at a minimum, to insert fifteen 8.5 x 5.5 inch sheets and four supplemental inserts into a 6.125 x 9.5 inch envelope.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<DESC>This amendment is to provide clarification as stated below:<br /><br />1500 sq/ft of just the BSL3 lab. The remainder of the lab is not included in the proposal. The BSL lab is the only lab to be commissioned
<p>The responses are due 18 April 2011 in accordance with the amended solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Soundness of approach would be the method the company would test or inspect a particular item within the attached standards in the PWS. For example: "Testing of BSCs meets required specifications after installation"--how does company x address this requirement and what approach do they use? What monitoring equipment do they use to test the air exchange or velocity? Are their technicians certified to do this type of monitoring or will this be a task subcontracted.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Disclaimer:  The Final Solicitation will take precedence over information in this posting and all draft documents.  ALL Questions related to the SSES Acquisition must be directed to the Contracting Officer, Kathleen Hageman vie email at kathleen.m.hageman.civ@mail.mil.<br><br><br>Clarifications <br><br>1. Source Selection Methodology. The SSES NexGen Acquisition will be conducted under Full and Open Competition and a Partial Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) using the Best Value Process as set forth in Section M of the Draft RFP. <br><br>2. Type of Contract/Contract Awards. The Government intends to make up to four awards each under a Full & Open (Unrestricted) Suite and a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) Suite to those Offerors whose proposals represent the best value to the Government.  The resulting SSES NexGen Contracts will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts under which the awardees will compete for Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Firm Fixed Price (FFP), and Time and Materials (T&M) Task Orders.  The period of performance is a three (3) year base period with two one ( 1) year option periods.  The maximum cumulative value of these contracts is $7 billion. Offerors may propose under the Unrestricted Suite, the SBSA Suite (if qualified) or under both Suites. Future Task Order efforts estimated at $4M and less will be awarded under the SBSA Suite.  Efforts estimated above the $4M threshold will be issued under the Unrestricted Suite.   If a Small Business receives an award under the Unrestricted Suite only, then they may only compete for actions above the $4M threshold.  <br><br>3. Subcontracting. The Government cannot limit the number of instances under which any single corporate entity can be a subcontractor.   A Small Business can be a Prime Contractor under the SBSA Contract and a Subcontractor in multiple instances under the Full and Open Contract.  <br><br>4. Small Business.  As indicated, a Small Business can propose and win an award under either or both Suites.   Therefore, a Small business can be a Prime Contractor under the Full and Open (Unrestricted) Suite and a Prime Contractor under the SBSA suite.    Teaming Arrangements. Offerors shall ensure that any proposed Contractor Teaming Arrangements are in compliance with the requirements of the FAR, to include FAR subpart 9.6.  <br>

<DESC>Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the design, engineering development, fabrication and test of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) for the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System with optional Low Rate Initial Production System production, testing and delivery and the associated program management, systems engineering, and logistic support planning requirements.  The objective of the AN/SLQ-25X program is to deploy an improved system that will provide the NIXIE acoustic and non-acoustic countermeasure capability previously fielded under AN/SLQ-25A/C with power, data and line handling interfaces to the TWS and improved Performance Monitoring/Fault Localization (PM/FL) capabilities.
  The AN/SLQ-25X will replace the AN/SLQ-25A/C System(s) on High Value Units (HVU). The AN/SLQ-25X is a digitally controlled, modular design, electro-acoustic soft-kill countermeasure decoy system.  It employs an underwater towed body acoustic projector, which is towed astern of the host ship by a fiber optic tow cable.  The system defends ships against wake homing and acoustic homing torpedoes.
The Navy plans to issue a draft of the AN/SLQ-25X Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and the Statement of Work (SOW) in the near future and provide a limited time for questions and comments.  Following the issuance of the draft PIPFS and SOW and the question, comment and answer period, the Navy plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 04 March 2011 for industry participation.
  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Companies may download the RFP on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The solicitation and any amendments thereto will be issued electronically; subsequently the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.  
The Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and other related files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance.  Prospective offerors must submit a written request for those documents to the PCO Representative, Sharon B. Allen, at Sharon.Allen@navy.mil.
  The written request must include the company name, cage code, and the complete destination address and security point of contact (POC).  Once a prospective offerors need-to-know and security clearance is verified and approved, the company will be authorized to receive the PIPFS and other related files.  The PIPFS and other related files will be mailed to the approved requestors on the same day the RFP is issued.  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Upon approval the classified PIPFS and all unclassified related files will be mailed.  
The Government will consider all written comments and or questions.  The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions.
  All such questions should be received within ten (10) working days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals.  Any subsequent revision to any specification or solicitation requirement based on comments and or questions received remains solely at the Governments discretion.  No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified in this synopsis.  
This is not an RFP.  This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract.
The point of contact is Sharon B.

All responses must be received by email at lorri.loveland@navy.mil no later than 2:00PM EST, 31 May 2011. No formal solicitation will be issued due to the fact that this is a sole source procurement.
All contractors and individuals doing business with the Federal Government MUST be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.
 Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements can be located via the Internet at www.ccr.gov . 
Responses that are non-compliant with any of these instructions may be rejected without further consideration for award.

Any future solicitation will be procured under the established NAICS Code 423450 "Medical, Dental, Hospital Equipment and Supplies" (Small Business Size Threshold of 100 employees) for certain Veteran Beneficiaries in the Greater Philadelphia/Southern NJ Geographic area.

One part of the program requires the use of Home-Based Patient Video Monitor Systems. Patients will receive a home video-monitoring device, adequate device training and appropriate technical support including set-up/installation/removal in the home.

<DESC>In accordance with Section 4.5 and 7.2 of the statement of work all buildings scheduled for demolition have been found to be unsound and in imminent danger of collapse by a local government agency.  As a result The National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants,(NESHAPS), have been modified in consultation with the USEPA and MDEQ. The modifications approved by the above agencies eliminate the requirement for an asbestos inspection and abatement prior to demolition. Since all structures in attachment 2 are in iminent danger of collapse, the modified procedures described in the Statement of Work apply to all structures being demolished, and the procedures are being allowed and assume that asbestos containing material (ACM) is present, but that abatement will not be required.<br><br>All other terms and condtions remain unchanged.<br>

05/26/2011 Amendment 2 notice and question and answer

This statement from the original posting is now changed: Only vendors who are eligible to receive the SOW are invited to attend [the Vendor Conference]. An exemption to the requirement that only vendors eligible to receive and store a classified document under this Solicitation may be made. That means two representatives from a company ineligible to receive and store classified documents under this Solicitation may attend the Conference, if they meet the requirements from DIA Security for a Visitor's Request. Each attendee to the Visitor Conference must follow the instructions posted to gain admittance.

Question and Answer
Q5. Where do I pick up the classified Statement of Work?
A5. From the posting above: "if approved the email will contain instructions about how to obtain the SOW under this Solicitation."

<DESC>This procurement is a response off of BAA N68335-10-R-0009. TCOM shall provide a prototype 22M Aerostat System and a variety of other products and services.
<p>This acquisition was issued as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract. A CPFF contract is the most appropriate contracting vehicle because this is a type of a cost reimbursement contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract, per FAR 16.306(a). Additionally, the fixed fee does not vary with actual cost but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract, in which this flexibility is desirable for this effort. A CPFF contract is ideal as it allows for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to contractors, but gives the contractor less incentive to control costs than a fixed price contract.</p>

<DESC>The Department is awarding a contract for Reenrollment of its' Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (MS EA Agreement). The U.S. Department of Education (Department) has been using Microsoft software for many years. The entire Department uses Microsoft software to perform daily functions. In order to receive the Microsoft software required to operate, the Department requires a new Microsoft Enterprise Agreement. The Department's IT infrastructure is contractor-owned and contractor-operated (COCO). Under the terms of the&nbsp;COCO contract, the contractor is responsible for obtaining the MS EA Agreement. However, the Department&nbsp;retains responsibility for&nbsp;some of the Microsoft licenses. In order to obtain the best pricing for all licenses, the Department's entire&nbsp;MS requirement was solicited by the COCO contractor.&nbsp;The purpose of this award&nbsp;is to fund the Department's portion of the MS EA Agreement.

<p>Based on information provided below, request the Contracting Officer determine that only one source is reasonably available to provide the supplies and/or services described herein.</p>
<p>1. Purchase request number: HE125420112010031</p>
<p>2. Description of supplies and/or services: DoDEA has an existing requirement to provide sustained professional development to all of its educators. To fulfill this requirement DoDEA has identified the need to procure four existing vendor hosted research-based interactive online courses on Differentiated Instruction (DI). Course content required includes broad, cross-curricular topics, content-specific topics or position specific topics. The total estimated number of courses to be procured is 1500 over a 12 month period of performance. <br />3. Proposed contractor: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) 1703 N Beauregard Street, Alexandria, VA 22311-1717</p>
<p>4. Reason the proposed contractor is the only source available: Based on market research to include information obtained from a recent posting on Federal Business Opportunities. ASCD is the only vendor who can meet DoDEA's requirement for four existing fully automated online courses on Differentiated Instruction.</p>
<p>5. Will these same supplies and/or services be needed again? Yes or No.:<br />DoDEA subject matter experts will continually monitor new developments to search if other/new sources become available that could possibly meet this requirement.</p>
<p>6. Price reasonableness: The courses to be procured are considered a commercial product and are listed as catalog pricing sold to a large group of educational, institutional and the general public. It is anticipated that discounts will be obtained from ASCD's standard catalog pricing.</p>

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(c) entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements-Application for Brand Name Descriptions."
5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is expected for these brand name items. VBA requires equipment from the manufacturer or an authorized partner to ensure that the equipment will interface with the VBA Milwaukee RO owned Nortel PBX.  The purchase of equipment from unauthorized partners could increase interoperability concerns and would cause damage (interoperability) to the VBA Nortel PBX.  This in turn could void the existing warranties and maintenance that is presently being provided to the VBA Milwaukee RO.  The market survey revealed multiple small business vendors can provide Nortel brand name products.  However, the Government will continue to solicit for Nortel authorized resellers in future acquisitions and specifically after the warranty period has expired on the Nortel system.  As noted, brand name items needed to fulfill the requirement are proprietary to Nortel equipment and can also be obtained by a Nortel authorized reseller.  
6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market Research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section.   Limited competition is anticipated for the required brand name item.   
7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name item, there are authorized resellers of these products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC contract.  Competition for this requirement among these vendors is anticipated.  Additionally, this Justification and Approval and the Request for Quote will be submitted to all four NASA SEWP IV GWAC Contract Groups in order to fully notify all interested parties and obtain price competition. Any proposals received will be evaluated. Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.202(a) (6), this effort is exempt from synopsizing since the proposed contract action is an order placed under an existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  Finally, in order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.
8.	Market Research: Contract Specialist conducted extensive market research utilizing SWEP tools validating  limited vendor support for Nortel products.  Therefore, limited competition is expected for this proposed action.  Evidence of market research can be found in the acquisition file.
9.	Other Facts: Based on extensive market research as described above, the Government's technical experts determined that only Nortel hardware and software can meet all of the Government's aforementioned requirements. Failure to acquire the aforementioned items would result in an inability to provide support to our new Milwaukee RO.  With the procurement of the Telecom system, the Milwaukee site will have the ability to provide a better quality of service to their customers (the veterans) in a timely manner.
10.	The Telecom system will also provide a better voice services to support the site and the ability to communicate with the VBA Milwaukee RO without accessing an outside line (circuit).  This will save on usage charges since communications will basically be like using an intercom system utilizing IP technology.  Also, 20% growth will be built-in to support additional employees in the future.

<DESC>Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition

1. 	Contracting Activity: 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295 on behalf of The Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, 5000 S. 5th Avenue, Hines, IL 60141.2.

The Hines VAMC needs 2 each of the 42575 Flex Tissue HD, Flex HD Ultrathick 6in x 12in, and Flex HD Ultrathick 16in x 20in.  This tissue is required for OR Procedures that are schedule to occur on May 24 - 27, 2011.  The current supply of tissue at the Hines VAMC is contaminated and cannot be used.  

4.	 Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.

Therefore, the VA needs to buy additional tissue to provide the necessary patient care.  It is very critical that we receive the tissue to perform all procedures.  MTF is able to provide the required product by the time of surgery.  MTF pre-screens donors and performs final sterility tests on all tissue before it is released to physicians for use.  Based on the Emergency situation it would be in the best interest of the government to Sole Source this requirement to MTF.
