(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.
(c)  If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
(1)	 A contractor may obtain a DUNS number?

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 03 Dec 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

Women in the workforce are vital to the nation's economic security. The Women's Bureau develops policies and standards and conducts inquiries to safeguard the interests of working women; to advocate for their equality and economic security for themselves and their families; and to promote quality work environments. The Women's Bureau aims to empower all working women to achieve economic security. <br />1.1 Women's Bureau Information System (WBIS)<br />In 2002, the Women's Bureau developed the Women's Bureau Information System, to improve its data collection, management and reporting capabilities.

For example, contact information in WBIS is accessible by a combination of locations, organization type, issue, or subject area.
