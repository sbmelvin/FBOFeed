<CONTACT>Susie Kramer Contracting Officer 2083785156     skramer@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, Boise, Idaho, is soliciting Phase One proposals for a firm-fixed price design build construction project to repair the Third Powerplant Roof at the Grand Coulee Powerplant, Grand Coulee, Washington.   Award of this design build project will be made using the procedures at FAR 36.3 - Two Phase Design Build Selection Procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238160 and the size standard is $13 million in gross annual receipts averaged over the previous three 1-year accounting periods.  The estimated price range of the work is $500,000 to $1,000,000.   The jobsite is located at Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River adjacent to the City of Coulee Dam, Washington, approximately 90 miles west of Spokane, Washington.  The Third Powerplant is a cast-in-place concrete structure with a precast tee beam roof approximately 85 feet above the adjacent grade.  The existing roof of the Third Powerplant is a spray-on rigid urethane foam insulation layer covered with a spray-on silicone rubber coating.  The roof is approximately 104 feet wide by 1,090 feet long and is broken into ten approximately square areas by expansion joints.  Many areas of the roof exhibit damage which includes blisters in the silicone coating at the top surface of the roof and cavities formed inside the urethane foam insulation.  We believe that the blisters and cavities are caused by moisture perpetration and by heat from the sun.  Once blisters form, additional holes are caused by birds that peck at the loose, blistered, silicone coating.   We estimate that approximately 10% of the area of the roof has been damaged, and requires repair, before covering the entire roof with an impervious coating.    The Phase One solicitation will be issued approximately January 29, 2007, and will only be available for downloading directly from the following website:  www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction/1646.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper or CD-ROM if it becomes necessary, and if you are registered on our website, you will be notified by e-mail.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.

<DESC>This is a Design/Build Best Value Source Selection firm fixed price construction solicitation.  This procurement is for one solicitation that will result in one award.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized a need for facilities located remote from the Roybal Campus which will provide support for the critical operations of the CDC in an event that these operations cannot be supported from the Roybal Campus.  Building A is largely unoccupied at the current time and provides an existing structure which can meet the space requirements of the project.  The base building electrical and mechanical services are adequate to meet the needs of this project with some equipment replacement and reworking of the distribution systems required.  This location also provides an existing secure perimeter and adequate open space.  Building A was originally designed as an animal breeding facility and majority of the space was made up of long narrow animal rooms.  Approximately 31,000 square feet has been demolished in preparation for the new construction.   The scope of this project includes the renovation of a portion of Building A.  This will include storage space for National Centers for Infectious Disease?s (NCID) Lab Response Network (LRN), and base building improvements to the existing Director?s Emergency Operations Center space (DEOC).  The existing DEOC space will remain relatively unchanged with modifications required to accommodate the new construction.  Work within this project will include interior renovation, exterior renovation, upgrades and additions to the existing electrical systems, HVAC systems, fire protection systems, installation of a new roofing system, and the removal, relocation, and installation of a satellite dish located at the Roybal Campus and providing the associated support needed.  The estimated cost range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.00.   

The source selection process as defined in FAR Part 15 has been selected in order to ensure selection of the sources evidencing best overall capability to perform the work in a manner most advantageous to the Government.  Firms submitting proposals will be evaluated on both their technical and price proposals.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposals determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Proposers should not assume they will be contacted, or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government may contact proposers for the purpose of clarifying aspects of their proposal. The Government also reserves the right to enter into discussions if deemed necessary, and if discussions are conducted the proposers will be afforded the opportunity to revise their proposals.

The above will only apply to those contractors that do not already possess DOD stickers and DOD badges.
Also, the driver must have the vehicle registration current and proof of insurance.  No Privately Owned Vehicles are allowed into the FISC compound; therefore, 
contractors shall arrive in company vehicles.  

*****Without a vehicle pass, contractors will have to leave their vehicle in a parking lot outside the gate and walk in to Building 1 on the compound.(approximately 1/2 mile)

Obtain badges and vehicle passes from the pass office at the Yorktown Naval Weapons station. Then they proceed up the interstate to the Cheatham exit and go to Cheatham Annex. We will be meeting in Building 1 at 11:00 which is about 1/2 mile after entering the Cheatham Annex gate.

The contract will also include the clause titled "Evaluation of Options" (FAR 52.217-5) except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interest.     Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The estimated cost for this construction project is between $1,000,000.00 - $5,000,000.00.

For this procurement the GSA Project Team shall evaluate all properly received offers consistent with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest price technically acceptable source selection process?.     As defined in FAR 15.101-2 (a) the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process is appropriate when best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

The GSA Project Team shall utilize the following factors as requirements for acceptability; Factor 1) Firm shall list a minimum of five (5) projects completed in the past five(5) years of a similar scope of work that have a total contract value of at least $1,000,000.00. Submit a description of the project in no more than (2) paragraphs. Factor 2) Firm shall submit superintendent's resume demonstrating that he/she has 5 years of experience as a superintendent.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Office National de l?Electricite, Direction des Approvisionnement et Marches, 65, Rue Othman Ben Affan, 20000 Casablanca, Morocco. Phone :  (212) 22-66-82 67, Fax:  (212) 22- 43 31 12.  Morocco ONE Reorganization Technical Assistance.  The Grantee, the Moroccan Office National de l?Electricite (ONE) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance on reorganizing ONE?s corporate structure with the perspective of liberalizing Morocco?s electricity sector.

The Government of Morocco (GOM) has been moving towards restructuring the country?s electricity sector over the past few years.  The most concrete step towards liberalization is occurring now as the final language of the electricity sector reform act is being reviewed by the Ministry of Energy for submission to the Parliament.  ONE supports the liberalization and has been directly involved in developing the legislation, which is expected to be approved during 2006.  As the largest actor in Morocco?s electricity sector, the electricity sector reform act?s liberalization legislation ("liberalization legislation") will significantly impact ONE through major revisions to the company?s mandate and the creation of an open and regulated electricity market.  

ONE is a publicly owned utility company and it is the principal actor in Morocco?s electricity sector, with a monopoly on electricity transmission and the largest distribution grid in-country.  With regards to power production, ONE owns and operates power plants and since 1994 it has held long-term contracts with private producers.  ONE currently fulfills the mission of single purchaser in Morocco; all Moroccan power plants sell all of their production to the company, which in turn sells it to the distribution companies, and industrial end users.  ONE manages all high voltage transmission lines, and for customers not covered by distribution companies (which account for 50% of their sales) it manages all medium and low voltage transmission lines.  In response to the GOM?s planned restructuring of the electricity sector and the upcoming liberalization legislation, ONE?s operations will change and it must reorganize itself to best meet its revised mandate.  
 
The reform consists of liberalizing the electricity sector in order to create increased competition to supply high and medium voltage customers (for eligible customers excluding distributors) and drive electricity prices more competitive.  In addition, the reform would create a specific responsibility for ONE to deliver electricity to the remaining customers (including distributors) under a regulated market.  In essence, the liberalization will create an Open Market and a Regulated Market.  All customers on high and medium voltage will be progressively eligible customers for the Open Market.  An exception is for the distribution companies, which will remain in the Regulated Market.  The reform will cause the formation of a Regulator who will take on various functions of the Ministry of Energy and ONE, including setting regulated tariffs and rules for the Open Market.  Any licensed operator or power exporter/importer will be able to contract directly with eligible customers.  

ONE will remain the transmission company in Morocco outside of the distribution companies.  It will wheel power for Open Market suppliers and customers.  ONE will also remain the single purchaser for the Regulated Market.  All existing Moroccan power generation will be put to the Regulated Market.  The clear goal of the liberalization legislation is to create more competitively priced power for industrial and commercial customers so that they can become more competitive in their production costs.  An eligible customer may enter into a long term contract, or acquire electricity under short term supply conditions.  Eventually the Regulated Market medium voltage customers will gradually become eligible customers for the Open Market. 

In anticipation of the GOM?s liberalization legislation, ONE has already implemented a partial reorganization with the advice of the U.S. consulting firm McKinsey & Company.  Among the changes it enacted, ONE created several divisions with individual profit and loss responsibility, allocating some functions into more suitable divisions.  But under the liberalization legislation, ONE will need to "corporatize" itself further and convert certain divisions into subsidiaries as defined in the proposed legislation.  ONE wishes to:  remain an efficient organization post-reform, ensure it can continue to remain competitive in both the regulated and liberalized market, and continue to fulfill its mandate to deliver electricity (its own or third party) at suitable costs to the end-user.  The liberalization legislation will require strict separation between the Open Market and Regulated Market businesses with which ONE will be directly involved, both as the main transmission company and as a power producer and importer.  In addition to obtaining advice on the establishment of the main subsidiaries, ONE wishes to evaluate the need to create a support subsidiary (or more) to provide services that can be shared by the main subsidiaries.  Finally, ONE seeks assistance in devising an implementation plan for the reorganization and support to initiate that plan.  To address these various needs, ONE has requested USTDA funding for Technical Assistance ("Assistance") to help the company optimize its reorganization.


The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $820,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AeroVironment Inc., 181 W. Huntington Dr., Suite 202, Monrovia, CA 91016-3456 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) has designated USSOCOM to lead the program to conduct a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) for Global Observer (GO).  The JCTD is intended to demonstrate the tactical utility of a hydrogen-powered Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) for long duration (five to seven day) missions at altitudes from 55,000 to 65,000 feet.  OSD selected Global Observer as an FY07 JCTD Rolling Start in the FY07 Congressional Report, Advanced Concept/Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (ACTD/JCTD).  The reason for the sole source award is the Department of Defense guidelines for JCTDs provide that technologies must have been successfully demonstrated at the subsystem or component level and at the required performance level prior to the start of the JCTD.  Based on our knowledge of the market, AeroVironment is the only contractor with a UAS system design that meets the JCTD technology readiness levels.  AeroVironment designed, fabricated, and demonstrated a sub-scale prototype UAS utilizing a hydrogen fuel cell to power the aircraft and a lightweight pressure vessel for liquid hydrogen storage.  Additionally, AeroVironment designed and built a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine and power-plant and successfully demonstrated it in an altitude chamber for a non-stop mission profile of five days at simulated operational environment above 65,000 feet.  Hydrogen power is a critical technology to achieve the long duration requirements of the UAS.  AeroVironment is currently executing a risk reduction program to develop and demonstrate a full-scale, flight prototype power-plant, propulsive motor, and liquid hydrogen fuel tank under a contract with USSOCOM.  As the developer, AeroVironment has the expertise to conduct the GO JCTD.  Award to any other source would not meet the JCTD technology readiness requirements.  Award to a source other than AeroVironment would not allow USSOCOM to meet the criteria to execute a JCTD program and/or demonstrate that tactical utility of a hydrogen-powered UAS for long duration (five and seven day) missions at altitudes from 55,000 to 65,000 feet.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract related to this announcement for a period of approximately three years with a potential maximum  value of up to $129,000,000.  Any questions regarding the above requirements should be submitted in writing via email to Ms Kim DeBois-Sousa, deboisk@socom.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is published as a sole source announcement under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, GCA Systems, Inc. 2233 South Presidents Drive, West Valley Ci ty, UT 84120 for upgrade to the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) at the Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) in Tobyhanna, PA 18466.   The systems proprietary Warehouse Management System (WMS) was developed in the year 2000 by the proprietor and staff  of what is now GCA Systems working as a subcontractor. Subsequently GCA provided remedial and preventive maintenance including software upgrades and fixes either as a subcontractor or recently as a prime contractor. At present the only party known to have  the proprietary rights to the system software as upgraded through the present revision level is the proposed contractor GCA Systems. The primary objective of the upgrade is to provide the ability to track parts on the shop floor. The Government does not h ave a competitive technical data package for upgrade to the TYAD ASRS system. The TYAD ASRS WMS software is proprietary to GCS Systems. Therefore, GCS Systems is the only firm known to provide the required system upgrade. Any firms believing they can provi de the required service should contact the Contract Negotiator identified within ten (10) days of this notice.  The NAICS Code is 333922 and the size standard is $500 employees. W25G1V-07-R-0003 applies.

<DESC>This serves as notification that Amendment 0001 to the Global Positioning System Wing (GPSW) Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) solicitation, FA8807-07-C-0003, has been issued and can be downloaded and viewed from FedBizOpps.  The purpose of this amendment is to correct Exhibit A, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) number A003, Contract Performance Report (CPR), to no longer reflect the requirement for an Earned Value Management System (EVMS).  CDRL A003, CPR, was vastly simplified to ensure it is clear to offerors that the CPR will be used to obtain cost performance reporting.  However, compliance with ANSI/EIA-748, Earned Value Management System (EVMS) is not required. Verbiage that referred to EVMS in the remarks section (Block 16) has been removed.  DID Formats 2-5 are no longer required.  Format 1 was tailored to only require in Section 8 column 1 (WBS element), column 4 (current charges), and column 9 (cumulative charges).

As a reminder, proposals are due Friday, February 9, 2007.

PROGRAMMATICS: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Col Robert Catlin, (310) 363-0887. 

DECLARATION: This publication is for information only and does not constitute a final Request For Proposal (RFP), government sponsorship of contractor charges against any government contract for proposal efforts, or a government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

The Offeror who is awarded the contract shall have access to landfills and/or transfer stations that are not legally prohibited from accepting the refuse requirements of this contract, which are gathered from the state of Illinois.  The State of Wisconsin has imposed legal restrictions on the disposal of Illinois solid waste.

TITLE: ADVANCED COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-03 -IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800 

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 July 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 6 Jan 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The intent of seeking advanced computing architectures is to explore computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by C2, ISR, and strike systems in order to establish, maintain, and exploit information superiority.  Evolution in computing performance, capacity, and adaptability will lead to extraordinary advances in warfighter capabilities and the systems they depend upon each day.  By broadening and increasing the cognitive capabilities of the computing infrastructure the advantages the warfighter has in filtering, detecting, tracking, fusion, and situational assessment can be unmatched.  Achieving, demonstrating, and fielding these cognitive advances in a constructive methodical manor is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate advanced computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of emerging advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems. This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include data intensive processing architectures, power aware processing architectures, polymorphic processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, clockless logic, grid computing, data storage, data visualization, data busses, mobile and wireless networks. Examples of software technologies include programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, and resource management. (2) Development of novel computing architectures that facilitate evolutionary computing (EC) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), etc. for solving hard, NP-complete optimization problems.  Research in this area could address design tools for mapping algorithms and fitness function evaluation engines onto hardware/software systems, achieving extreme solution speeds, problem size scaling, physical miniaturization and power minimization of the physical platform.  Also of interest would be research aimed at employing EC methods to enhance and optimize the design process for composing such hardware/software systems, and applications of these technologies to specific optimization problems of interest to the Information Directorate. (3) Development of technologies supporting utilization of hybrid computation systems such as quantum or biomolecular computing combined with conventional CMOS Silicon systems. New algorithms and architectures, for interfaces between conventional electronic systems and systems based on new operations paradigms, are needed to transduce information in the most efficient manner.  This will enable development of hybrid systems with unique capabilities beyond general computing, such as intrinsic contextual addressing and computing. (4) Modeling and Simulation. Development of virtual real time modeling and simulation methods to enable more human intuitive design processes. Research in this area would focus on demonstrating extreme speed-ups of modeling and simulation engines used in present or proposed design environments, in order to achieve near real time inspection of the effect of changes made to a device or information system design.  This research area would also encompass fast methods to cast models and simulation engines into parallel and embedded processing platforms. In addition this area includes the development of simulation technology to perform rapid assessment and course of action analysis of the predictive battlespace environment. Examples of these particular technologies include: real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, M&S for wargaming, behavior representation, predictive assessment of adversarial actions, adversary intent inferencing, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of dynamic planning/execution, and real-time decision support. (5) Development of hardware and software processing architectures and techniques to enhance mechanisms of intelligence leading to cognizant computing.  Examples might be learning algorithms, knowledge creation techniques, storage or computation media physically addressed by a context mechanism such as resonance or stochastic summation, or distributed processing where each of many parallel sensing devices, has its own processor that does significant data interpretation/reduction. (6) Development of information technology leading to the advancement or demonstration of autonomous systems for enabling improved situational awareness, situational management, and situational control of the battlespace. This area includes all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing awareness and response through processing, reconfigurability, networking, communication, teaming, and control of ground, air, and/or space platforms.

TITLE: Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP) Standard Reference Frame

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:     Initial announcement 

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #06-09-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 by 15 January 06; FY 07 by 1 May 06 and, FY 08 by 1 May 07. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 September 2008, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.         

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that investigate tools, techniques and technologies that facilitate cost-effective harvesting, migration or replacement of legacy systems to achieve net-centricity. This BAA presents a framework and methodology for linking the architecture views (based on the views from the DoD Architecture Framework v1.0 [DODAF]) and requirements within a toolsuite. This methodology is currently being used to support the Joint DoD software development project for an Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM). Within this methodology, the DoD AF is used as a systems engineering tool, bridging the operational-to-system-to-software architecture gaps which are much of the source of interoperability difficulties today. The desired efforts will also design and perform incremental Integrated Architecture Behavior Model (IABM) demonstrations leading to Joint system of systems demonstration. 

         (1) SIAP Standardization: The Single Integrated Air Picture (SIAP), will become a networking tool intended to endow commanders, pilots and even infantrymen with a single tactical picture of the battlespace, showing friendly and enemy units on land, sea and in the air.  SIAP is seen as a principal means of networking forces together to create a decisive warfighting advantage. The Pentagon's Integrated Architecture Behavior Model, an element of SIAP, is a computer program designed to measure the adequacy and fidelity of information used to form a shared understanding of the tactical situation, according to an August 2003 report on SIAP attributes. The information developed from various military sensors would have to conform to common standards in order to create the SIAP. This standardization would enable the shooter in an F/A-18E/F tactical aircraft to use information from an Army air defense missile battery, for example. Or Aegis ships would be able to target their missiles using information obtained by an Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane. To achieve the SIAP would require that all sensors utilize a standard reference frame for conveying information about the location of targets. Systems won't be able to tell where the data came from, but it will be better, more accurate and less redundant. To achieve the SIAP would require that all sensors utilize a standard reference frame for conveying information about the location of targets. Specific areas of SIAP research/development that this BAA covers include: 

                 a.  A Joint Service SIAP Systems Architecture for integrating and deploying SIAP applications among USAF and Joint Services.

	    b.  Advanced simulation technologies to assess and test emerging SIAP capabilities to achieve net-centricity.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of increased situational awareness for ISR cross platform collaboration and cross platform cueing.

Today's intelligence operators and analysts continue to rely on solutions that are largely domain or sensor-type specific.  Additionally, the closed architectures of the various systems make the combination of each system's capabilities into a single component costly and, in some cases, not possible.  This BAA addresses the need for an open-architected and scalable solution to these issues.  The requirement is for an integrated, operator-focused, multi-intelligence knowledge association system that can ingest data from multiple ISR sensors and intelligence sources and support cross platform cueing, cross platform collaboration, Time Critical/Sensitive Targeting, strike planning, and support to overall battlefield situation awareness monitoring, and reporting and provide Situation Assessment tools that can be adapted to a variety of missions including Area of Interest monitoring and alerting; High Interest Track monitoring and alerting; and enhancing operator understanding through cross referencing known information and databases.

The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies.  This program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units while developing new capabilities and technologies. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the five year program. In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment. 

The developed capabilities may be transitioned to the RC135 fleet to include Rivet Joint and Senior Scout, C2C, National Systems, the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and other ISR platforms. 

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $24.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $1.5M; FY 07 - $7.5M; FY 08 - $5.5M; FY09 - $5.9M; FY10 - $4.5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $350K to $2.2M per year.

<DESC>MODIFICATION TO EXTEND DUE DATE TO 1:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 23, 2007.     Request for Information - The United Stated Department of Agricultures (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) seeks information related to its investigation of ways to consolidate and centralize its distributed AS/400 systems currently hosted in 2384 Service Centers.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). FSA intends to assess the capabilities and, if appropriate, issue an RFP at a later date.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.  Background - Current Environment:  FSAs current distributed environment includes 2384 State and County Service Centers, each equipped with an AS/400 Model 170 system.  Local users access their offices AS/400 via PC workstations running 5250 terminal emulation.  Output is printed on a combination of twinax-attached and network-attached printers.  An average office has about four users, making a total user community of about 10,000.  The primary use of these systems is to run S/36 applications developed and maintained by FSA from 1984 to the present.  These applications run in the S/36 Virtual Machine environment (not to be confused with the S36 Environment, or S36E).  The S/36 Virtual Machine environment provides binary compatibility for S/36 applications and data. IBM dropped support for the S/36 Virtual Machine after release V4R4 of the OS/400 operating system.  Our reliance on the S/36 Virtual Machine forces us to remain on an unsupported version of the OS/400 operating system.  The S/36 application portfolio consists of COBOL, RPG, and Assembler programs and subroutines; Screen and Menu members; OCL.  These make use of unique S/36 capabilities and extensions such as the Local Data Area, and OCL substitution expressions.  System facilities such as IDDU and Query/36 are also used.  The data is stored in Indexed (including Alternative Indices), Sequential, and Direct files.  Some files have multiple record types; and some numeric-defined fields may contain non-numeric data.   Each AS/400-S/36 environment hosts one to six counties.  The S/36 namespace does not include a hierarchical file system.  A naming convention is used to allow each of hosted counties to use the same file names.  The first counties filenames begin with A., the second with B. and so on.  This convention works fine for supporting a small number of counties on a single machine, but cannot be extended to support large-scale consolidation.  The applications were developed under the assumption that they would be running in a small, local namespace.  In 2000, FSA started deploying AS/400 systems and re-hosted the applications and data from S/36 systems.  Once on the AS/400 platform, FSA started using DB2, TCPIP, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, as well as the S/36 emulation.  MQ Software products Data Flow Studio (DFS) and QPasa are also used for file transmissions and MQ Series administration.  The complete current environment consists of AS/400s running S/36 emulation, plus some AS/400-side code (CL, COBOL), DB2 databases, TCPIP communications, Java, Websphere, and MQ Series, DFS, and QPasa.  In addition to the legacy applications, FSA has developed centralized web-based applications.  Once a full suite of Web-based applications is available, these will replace the legacy applications and the distributed environment.  Some of the existing web-based applications must get data from, or replicate data to the legacy applications.  This is done through a combination of AS/400 CL programs, Java programs, Websphere applications, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, and additions to legacy applications.  Planned Environment:  The data stored on the 2,384 AS/400 systems includes sensitive personal and financial data.  Recent audits have identified a lack of physical security at the Service Centers, which house these systems, as a risk.  The Service Centers are generally leased office spaces located across the country.  Improving the physical security in all of these offices is an expensive process and is not likely to be accomplished quickly.  The building changes would have to be negotiated into the individual leases, and may not be possible until the current leases expire.  Due to the cost and timeframe of improving physical security, FSA is exploring the alternative of re-hosting the legacy applications in a small number of secure, central sites.  FSA is researching several variations of the centralized hosting approach, but they all share many characteristics.  The number of central sites being considered is in the range of 1 to 6.  For all centralized approaches, Service Center users will remotely access the centralized servers from their local workstations, via terminal emulation software or a web client.  Print output will be directed back to network printers in the appropriate Service Center.  The centralized systems will interact with other hosts, including mainframe and web farm.  The centralized approaches under consideration are:  1.  FSA would remove the existing AS/400 systems from the Service Centers and relocate all of the existing hardware to a small number (1-6) of centralized hosting facilities.  For six centers, this is about 400 AS/400 systems per center.  2.  FSA would re-host the legacy applications and data on a larger computing platform, which provides binary-level emulation of the current environment AS/400, S/36, MQ Series, Websphere, etc.  Assuming that one larger system can host the workload from many legacy AS/400s, and that users and data can be correctly routed and segregated, re-hosting on larger systems would mean fewer systems for the hosting facilities to operate.  This consolidation may include providing a virtual partition for each existing system.  3.  FSA would re-compile application software in order to migrate to another hardware platform, which could be scaled so that a single system would do the work of many legacy AS/400 systems.  This is similar to approach #2, except with re-compilation and migration work.  4.  FSA wishes to solicit any other relevant available options that could remove the physical security vulnerability while ensuring successful program delivery.  Desirable characteristics include:  Ability to run all existing applications and Query 36 without modification, Support combined AS/400 S/36 environment (DDM, ILAN, STRM36PRC, RUN400, etc.), Support AS/400 software, including Websphere 3.5, MQ Series, DFS, QPasa, Ability to implement without recompiling code  (Recompiling will add difficulty and complexity), Minimal changes for the FSA software developers.  FSA will continue to develop in the S/36 environment, Ability to address scaling and namespace issues, Ability to connect each remote user to the correct partition/namespace/data, Correct printing of reports, User experience and performance similar to current environment, Minimal downtime, at least comparable to current environment, Ad hoc report capability; Query 36 is preferred.

<DESC>Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) Request for Information (RFI)
	
This is a request for information and not a solicitation.


INTRODUCTION:
An RFI and associated Industry Day was held in April 2006 to obtain information concerning a Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT).  Continued technical analysis has been used to generate a DRAFT Test Capability Requirements Document (TCRD).  A review of this document for comment by industry is scheduled for 31 January 2007 in Colorado Springs, CO and interested parties are invited to attend.

The STAT will be a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects.  STAT will provide connectivity to a satellite control center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats.  STAT is envisioned to include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources.   STAT Spiral 1 will develop the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test sub-system size components and microsats.  

PLEASE INDICATE YOUR INTEREST TO ATTEND 
TO THE POINT OF CONTACT BELOW BY 
24 January 2007

Note: The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with this submittal of the request for information.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or a Request for Proposal, nor should it be considered as a commitment on the part of the Government.


1.  SCOPE.
This request for information is directed to potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities.  The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential acquisition strategies for the STAT.  Further, this information will help the Government structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule and performance risks.

2.   OBJECTIVES.  
The main objectives in this project are as follows:
1. Design the STAT Spiral 1 facility.
2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. 
3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided GFE.
4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls and Satellite Operation Center Links into a functional test capability.

3.  REQUIREMENTS.
The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions.  It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources, and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a satellite operations center (SOC).  The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:

3.1	Operational:  The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment, to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging.  It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources, and the ability to connect the payload to the Satellite Operations Center.
  
3.1.1	The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.
  
3.1.2	The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental source in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.

3.1.3	The system shall allow the connection of the System Under Test (SUT) to be connected to a remote Satellite Operations Center at the Center for Research Support (CERES) at Falcon AFB, Colorado, and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.

3.1.4	The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.

3.2	Chamber Infrastructure:  An 8ft by 24ft vacuum chamber located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort.  Integration of vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as an integrated control system shall be accomplished by the contractor.  Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.

3.3	Natural Environment Sources:

3.3.1	The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities capable of simulating energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.  

3.3.2	The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities capable of simulating fluences seen at solar max.

3.3.3	The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at 2 times solar intensity.

3.3.4	The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities capable of simulating trapped electrons.
 
3.4	Spacecraft Self-induced Condition Simulation:

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with BD GeneOhm Inc. 6146 Nancy Ridge Drive, San Diego, CA 92121 for the SmartCycler 2 and Add on Block.  The SmartCycler 2 and Add-on Block are required to perform the BD GeneOhm Sciences, Inc. IDI-MRSA assay.  The IDI-MRSA test is designed specifically for use on the Cepheid Smart Cycler 2 system with an assay time of two hours.  This equipment rapidly detects MRSA.  MRSA is a significant causative agent for hospital acquired infections in North America resulting in catheter-associated, wound- associated, and respiratory infections. When compared to culture methods, requiring two to five days, the BD GeneOhm MRSA test will enable the VAPHS to improve the identification of MRSA which can effectively result in the prevention and control of MRSA infections.  MRSA colonization of patients and employees has been shown to be the most important predictor for propagation of MRSA infection to high risk un-colonized patients in an inpatient care setting.  The SmartCycler 2 System is a rapid, real-time thermal cycler used for identifying DNA/RNA from prepared biological samples.  By automating much of the testing and making each reaction site individually programmable, it is the fastest, easy to use, and most flexible system available on todays market.  With the SmartCycler 2 System, each independently programmable module performs four-color, real-time fluorescent detection.  Samples are amplified and measured in the SmartCyclers proprietary sealable reaction tubes which are designed to optimize rapid thermal transfer and sensitivity, as well as to reduce the possibility of amplicon contamination.  The SmartCycler 2 System enables the detection of several targets within a single specimen (multiplex assays) by using multiple fluorescent dyes and detecting the fluorescent signal in four channels.  The SmartCycler 2 System is approved by the FDA for use with the BD GeneOhm MRSA test kit. This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Vendors who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than January 22, 2007.  Such notification must include a complete description of equipment including narrative and capabilities described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer, (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206.  Upon receipt of any such notifications, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with  BD GeneoHm, 6146 Nancy Ridge Drive, San Diego, CA 92121 for the BD GeneOhm MRSA assays. The BD GeneOhm MRSA (IDI-MRSA) test from BD GeneOhm Inc. is the only rapid, molecular-based assay cleared by the FDA and bearing the CE Mark for the direct detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from a nasal specimen.  This assay is a qualitative in-vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA) to aid in the prevention and control of MRSA infections in healthcare settings.  The test performed on the Smart Cycle 2 instrument with a nasal swab specimen from patients at risk for colonization, utilizes polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of MRSA DNA and fluorogenic target- hybridization probes for the detection of the amplified DNA. The test provides a definitive result with an assay time of less than two hours. The BD GeneOhm MRSA test detects a unique molecular sequence which confers a double specificity: half of this sequence comes from the S. aureus chromosome; the second half is within the genetic element carrying methicillin resistance, the SCCmec cassette. The test detects the SCCmec sequence using a specific protocol. The BD GeneOhm MRSA test kit is composed of the following assay specific reagents, which when used with the above protocol and the Smart Cycler 2 instrument provide a definitive result within two hours. Sample buffer  Tris-EDTA buffer Lysis tube  Glass beads Master mix  < 0.0005 % DNA polymerase complex < 0.001% Internal Control - non-infectious DNA containing MRSA-primer binding sequences and a unique sequence for probe hybridization < 0.002 % primers < 0.002 % molecular probes < 0.05 % dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP Bovine serum albumin Carbohydrate MgCl2 < 0.001 % non-infectious Staphylococcus epidermidis genomic DNA (ATCC 14990) Control DNA Tris-EDTA buffer Carbohydrate < 0.001 % non-infectious genomic MRSA DNA (ATCC 43300) Diluent  Tris-HCl buffer MgCl2 (NH4)2SO4 KCl This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Vendors who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an MRSA test assay compatible with the Smart Cycle 2 as described above, may notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 9:00 A.M. on January 22, 2007.  Such notification must include a complete description of proposed test assays, including narrative and capabilities described above.  Responses may be sent to Kathleen.Policicchio@va.gov or mailed to Kathleen Policicchio, Contracting Officer, (04A1-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206.  Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the VAPHS Contracting Officer.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATION  - Computational Research and Theory Facility

The University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), intends to contract for Professional Architecture & Engineering services for the Computational Research and Theory Building (CRT) project, the construction cost for the project is estimated at $70,000,000. 
The CRT Project will be a showcase facility for high performance unclassified scientific computing and be a model for an energy efficient computing center. It will provide new space to enable the advancement of scientific knowledge, education, and service through high performance computing.  To meet this goal, a new facility is proposed to be constructed on the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory site located near Buildings 50B & 70A with approx. 160,000 GSF and 4 to 5 stories high.  The design will allow for 40,000 GSF to support high performance computing, 35,000 GSF of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment and 85,000 GSF of office space. The existing NERSC Center (http://www.nersc.gov) will be moved to the new site and collocate computer scientists, mathematicians, computational scientist and theoreticians into the same facilities. The design must address high power and heat load demands as projected for future generations of high performance computers in a flexible and energy efficient manner.  Innovative approaches to meet the high performance computer requirements and minimize energy consumption will be an important project goal.  

This is not a request for quotation.  It is an announcement for contracting opportunities with the University of California, Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit qualifications as indicated below.

Scope of Services: The work includes, but is not limited to, professional architectural and engineering services.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technologys Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seeks to identify potential sources interested in submitting a Letter of Interest (LOI) in providing heat exchangers that support the Deep Space Mission Systems (DSMS) 20kW transmitters. KEY REQUIREMENTS  The heat exchangers are replacements for obsolete heat exchangers that cool water for the 20kW transmitters used by the Deep Space Network (DSN). The DSN is an international network of antennas that support deep space missions and radio and radar astronomy observations for the exploration of the solar system and the universe. The new heat exchangers will: (1) Be an enclosed assembly located external to an antenna consisting of an enclosure, a radiator, air moving equipment (fans), water moving equipment (pumps), and supporting electrical and electronic equipment, and  supplied by power from the electrical grid 480V, 60Hz, 3phase; (2) Be of a water-to-air type operating in an outdoor environment with temperatures ranging from	  -20C to +60C; (3) Maintain water temperature within 0.5C of a user-selected regulation temperature given an external heat load ranging from 2kW to 77kW (the user will set the regulation temperature at least 5C above the maximum ambient temperature); (4) Provide a water flow rate of at least 35 gallons per minute with pressure ranging from 145 to 160 pounds per square inch (gauge); (5) Protect itself from water freezing in the piping by circulating water automatically when the outside temperature approaches 0C. In the event of a power failure while a freezing condition exists, the heat exchanger must protect itself by purging water from the radiator element; (6) Demonstrate a mean time between failures of at least 10,000 hours; (7) Provide a hard-wired 28V control and monitor interface compatible with existing 20kW transmitters; and (8) Provide instrumentation of key components using an Ethernet interface to support reliability-centered maintenance. This very brief description is not complete, but does encapsulate much of the functionality that heat exchangers will provide. JPL plans to purchase an evaluation (engineering) model from at least two (2) vendors and evaluate their performance and reliability. Following this evaluation, a single vendor will be selected to provide a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of twelve (12) heat exchangers to support the existing 20kW transmitters. Further procurements may be placed later should additional transmitters be built for the DSN. WHO MAY RESPOND? This LOI is open to industry; other government agencies (i.e., any non-NASA, U.S. federal executive agency, national laboratory) or Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). COMPLIANCE WITH EXPORT CONTROL REGULATIONS  U.S. law requires that no export controlled technical and/or scientific information/data can be transferred to Foreign Persons. If your corporation agrees to limit access to U.S. Persons only, then such information/data that has been marked as export controlled may be transferred. If your organization has determined that a foreign national(s) will be involved either directly or indirectly in the performance of any resulting effort, please notify JPL immediately in writing providing the name of the individual(s) and the capacity under which they will be working so that the necessary steps can be taken.

It also means any foreign corporation, business association, partnership, trust, society or any other entity or group that is not incorporated or organized to do business in the United States, as well as international organizations, foreign governments and any agency or subdivision of foreign governments (e.g. diplomatic missions). DUE DATE:  Potential sources should respond to this LOI via email to: maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov no later than January 31, 2007, 3:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, including (a) company name; (b) contact information; (c) business status (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business; woman-owned, foreign entity, etc.); and (d) any other information about your company and/or experience in this type of effort.

Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 25 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  A decision will be made to negotiate a sole source procurement with an 8(a) contractor, issue this solicitation as a competitive Service Disabled Veteran Owned or HubZone Small Business contract, or to issue an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.  The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.

5.	Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status.

6.	Provide available Bonding Capabilities that would be available after April 2007.  We are not looking for your Bonding Capactity but rather the amount you have available considering current workload.  (Ex, Bonding Capactity $10M, current projects $7M, available bonding capability is $3M).   

The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company?s ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the area specified herein.

<DESC>COMMERCIAL AREA ANNOUNCEMENT / INNOVATIVE IDEAS SOUGHT FOR THE UPGRADE OF THE FLEET READINESS CENTER (FRC) EAST'S (FORMERLY NAVAIR DEPOT CHERRY POINT, NC) HEWLETT-PACKARD XP-512 STORAGE AREA NETWORK (SAN). FRC East is a Department of Defense (DoD) industrial facility responsible for the repair, overhaul and re-manufacture of DoD aircraft and components. Day to day operations within the facility are heavily dependant upon computer systems which are used for planning and scheduling workload, collecting employee time and attendance records, and a variety of other information management tasks. As currently configured, the SAN provides approximately 32 terabytes of storage. It offers advanced data management capabilities as well as predictive monitoring to detect abnormalities in system components prior to failure to allow the SAN to provide maximum uptime. The system interfaces to FRC East computers via a fiber channel fabric. Although a variety of data is stored on the SAN, its primary purpose is to support a HP-UX high availability cluster as the repository for Oracle database files.  The FRC East Information Technology Department is interested in determining whether to pursue a procurement to upgrade the existing SAN or replace it with a new enterprise storage system. The final solution must offer approximately 100 terabytes of storage capacity.  It should further offer the typical data management capabilities and diagnostic monitoring facilities commonly associated with modern enterprise data storage systems. The system should include integrated tape backup capability. Finally, it must interface easily with HP-UX (PA-RISC), Solaris (Sparc and X86), Microsoft Windows (X86), and Red Hat Linux (X86) computer systems. FRC East does not wish to limit consideration to fiber channel/SAN solutions, but is open to the consideration of IP and/or Network Attached Storage (NAS) or any other combination of technologies that will meet our enterprise data storage requirements. In addition to the technological solution, system engineering and integration services will be required to integrate the final solution into the FRC East IT infrastructure, including system reconfigurations and migration of data from the existing system. Finally, enterprise level maintenance support will be required for the storage solution to ensure business continuity for FRC East.  Companies responding to this request should provide information outlining, in broad terms, innovative and imaginative technological solutions to upgrade or replace the existing SAN.  Please include sufficient information to show your firm's technical expertise and capability to provide the equipment/hardware and software, system engineering and integration services, and three years of annual system maintenance.  Proprietary information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis. Please include corporate information, including business size status. Please send responses to Christopher Murphy, Contract Specialist, Code 2.5.1.6, Bldg. 159, NAVAIR Contracts, FRC East, PSC Box 8021, Cherry Point, NC 28533-0021 at (252) 464-7031 or by e-mail: christopher.w.murphy@navy.mil. This Commercial Area Announcement (CAA) is for informational purposes only.  Responses in any form are not offers.  The issuance of this CAA does not impose any obligation on the DoN or signify a firm commitment to issue a solicitation or a contract.  There are no funds available to pay for the cost of preparing the responses to this CAA.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for information / items solicited. Information / items solicited will not be returned.  The Government may use the information received in responses to build a future Solicitation.  To be of maximum benefit to the program, responses must be received by 02 February 2007.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Information (RFI) for BioSense Program
<DESC>SUMMARY:  

This is a request for information only.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) is seeking to evaluate commercial products, or products in development, and services that are suitable for use in addressing the BioSense program's requirements for data acquisition, data analysis, data presentation and reporting, and use of data for a Public Health Response, as needed.


BACKGROUND:  

BioSense is a CDC program to improve the nation's capabilities for real-time biosurveillance and health situational awareness.  To that end, BioSense develops and implements enhanced capabilities to rapidly detect and monitor bioterrorism, natural disease outbreaks, and other events of public health importance.  The primary objective is to expedite event recognition and response coordination among federal, state, and local public health and healthcare organizations by providing situational awareness to each level of public health through access to the same data, at the same time.  BioSense achieves this by connecting existing health information to public health in a way not previously possible, by providing access to data from hospitals, healthcare systems, and other sources.  
Currently, the majority of health-related information systems that exist nationally vary in their ability to share data to support immediate biosurveillance needs.  BioSense conducts near real-time biosurveillance and health situational awareness through access to existing data from these healthcare organizations across the country.  Additionally, the BioSense Program provides access to the BioSense application, a web-based system for use by healthcare facilities and state and local public health partners.

 
DESCRIPTION:  

The current BioSense operation spans four principal functions:
 -  Data Acquisition  - to assure the secure, timely, routine acquisition of health data for public health surveillance;
 -  Data Analysis - to develop, evaluate, and apply analytic signal detection methodologies and algorithms and disseminate these methodologies to selected cities and states, to interpret the results of the analysis, in as close to real-time as possible; 
 - Data Reporting - on a near real-time basis, provide useful views of the data, including time series analysis and geospatial displays, to colleagues in state and local health departments, hospital personnel, as well as to CDC programmatic staff;
 - Supporting Public Health Response - to provide local data to state and local partners and support their use and interpretation of these data for investigations, outbreak response and public health interventions.
These functions are today provided through a loosely integrated set of services.  BioSense seeks an integrated, end-to-end solution that encompasses a range of services including data source acquisition and relationship management, database design and management, hardware integration and deployment, software development and implementation, technical infrastructure support and maintenance, expert advisory services, and the required transition management.
As of December 2006, approximately 350 facilities are sending data of various types to CDC including Foundational data (aligned with the AHIC Minimum Data Set), Emergency Department, Clinical, Micro, Radiology, and Pharmacy data.  In addition, 466 Department of Defense and 863 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics and emergency departments are sending data daily to CDC.  Further, BioSense is in some stage of implementation with healthcare organizations or existing surveillance networks representing over 700 hospitals (including their EDs and in many cases their associated ambulatory care centers).  In total, CDC has commitments from healthcare and existing systems representing more than 1,190 hospitals willing to transmit data to BioSense.
CDC's implementation goals have been defined as follows:
 -  Cumulative Hospitals:
o	350 by end of calendar year 2006
o	1,450 by end of calendar year 2007
o	2,500 by end of calendar year 2008
o	3,500 by end of calendar year 2009
 -  Veterans Affairs(VA) and Department of Defense(DoD): Real-time data feeds to be complete in 2007
 -  Commercial laboratories: 3 largest commercial laboratories reporting microbiology results with data feeds complete in 2007
 -  Poison Control Centers: 62 poison control centers, data feeds complete in early 2007

     In the near-term BioSense will focus on addressing six principal objectives:
     First, a focus on catastrophic public health emergencies, as opposed to routine public health outbreaks, given the high-risk of impact on morbidity and mortality; 
     Second, a focus on enhancing biosurveillance capabilities for major metropolitan areas given their population size and corresponding high-risk; 
     Third, a focus on achieving simultaneous data feeds from acute care hospitals to state and local public health departments as well as CDC;
     Fourth, assessing the comparative effectiveness and costs of different sub-network configurations for connecting healthcare entities and public health entities (e.g., links to individual hospitals, links to data-aggregation sites for hospital chains, and links to Regional Health Information Organizations or Health Information Exchanges;  
     Fifth, field-testing the Minimum Data Set (MDS) accepted by the American Health Information Community (AHIC) to ascertain the feasibility of adoption and to determine where modifications are necessary and what form those should take; and
     Sixth, exercise of BioSense during the 2007/2008 seasonal influenza epidemic to determine whether "proof of concept" has been attained.

   
RESPONSE:  

Data obtained from this RFI will be used by CDC in refining the acquisition strategy for the procurement of the next generation of BioSense services.  Interested organizations that have candidate products and services are invited to submit a written response to CDC.
     As a minimum, submitted information should include:
  (a)  A description of the respondent's approach to addressing the four principal functions of BioSense and the six near-term objectives;
  (b)  A description of the expected challenges in executing these functions and achieving these objectives, and the manner in which the respondent's solution addresses these challenges;
  (c)  A description of the technologies supporting the proposed approach;
  (d)  A description of the critical factors for achieving success in execution of the functions and achievement of the objectives; and
  (e)  A listing of the categories of prices and estimates of those prices on a per-unit basis, if readily available for commercial products or services, or an indication of the price estimate for products or services that are not readily available commercially.
  REMINDER:  This is not a request for proposals.  Supporting cost data is not required nor requested.  Any pricing data provided, including estimates, is informational only and will be used to help formulate and refine the Government Cost Estimate for this requirement.  This is an aspect of market research only.  Providing pricing information is optional.

All information submitted to CDC will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law, including the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) and the Trade Secrets Act (18 USC 1905).  Information should be submitted by 12:00 p.m. (noon) on Monday, January 29, 2007.  Responses should be limited to 12 pages, are preferred in electronic format, and can be e-mailed to the attention of the Contracting Officer:  Vivian S. Hubbs, Phone 770-488-2647, email VHubbs@cdc.gov.  If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please call the Team Leader, Lorenzo Falgiano.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
   
 (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficie nt detail to demonstrate the companys ability to meet the requirement.  Information may be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: john.fitzsimmons@amedd.army.mil .  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses r eceived from responsible businesses prior to close of business on 26 Janauary 2007 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source order.  See numbered Note 22. 1. Contracting Activity: The contracting activity responsible for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), Fort Detrick, MD. 2. Description of Action: This approval is being requested for a new firm-fixed price contract using R&D funds. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: The required item is an upgrade from the genome sequencer 20 to the genome sequencer FLX upgrade.  The instrument is used for the purpose of whole genome sequencing and the upgrade will significantly increase the throug hput capabilities of our current machine in addition to renewing the warranty. 4. Authority Cited: The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10U.S.C 2304  (1).  The FAR citation is 6.302-1 and the FAR title is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requireme nts.  5. Reason for Authority Cited: The proposed vender for this action is Roche Diagnostics Corporation.  Roche Diagnostics Corporation has the unique qualification for fulfilling the contract requirement because they are the only vendor distributing the upgra de cited above.  No other vendor distributes this upgrade.  By the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the required delivery schedule and the lead time involved is 31 January, 2007. 6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Not applicable, NO effort will be made to solicit offers from as many potential sources as is practicable as there is only one source capable of performing the required services.  No effective competition is anticipated. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: To date no actions to increase competition have been initiated.  The genome sequencer FLX upgrade is an upgrade of a machine distributed by Roche Diagnostics Corporation and only available through Roche. 8. Market Research: Market research was conducted to find additional suppliers of the Roche Diagnostics Corporation genome sequencer FLX upgrade.  The upgrade is specific to the machine being used and is distributed solely by Roche Diagnostics Corporation.   The maintain consistency in the results and quality of the assays, only Roche Diagnostics Corporation can provide the genome sequencer FLX upgrade.  Unless Roche installs the upgrade requested, there will be a termination of the warranty on the instrumen t. 9. Interested Sources: To date no other sources have written to express an interest.  All sources other than Roche Diagnostics Corporation are rejected based upon the statutory authority permitting full and open competition (10 U.S.C. 2304(1)) are rejecte d.
