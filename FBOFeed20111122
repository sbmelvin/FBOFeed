<DESC>This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Restoration Branch (TDV) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Environmental Restoration, Compliance Restoration, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This solicitation is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field (i.e. a service). The areas of need for this announcement are:<br /><br />Restoration Program:<br />a. Priority 1 - Emerging Contaminants: Proposals should include innovative treatment technologies such as applied in situ bioremediation, chemical oxidation, chemical reduction, or other innovative technologies that specifically address emerging issues and/or contaminants. Emerging issues can be considered those chemicals, materials, or items that have the potential to affect the AF's ability to execute programs, impact schedules, increase cost, or alter a technical approach. Emerging contaminants should be those currently on the AFCEE Emerging Issues list, the Department of Defense Emerging Contaminants Action and Watch lists, USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List, and/or other contaminants that have potential significant Air Force implications as judged by AFCEE/TDV. Specific needs relate to the characterization of emerging contaminant exposure pathways and associated risks, emerging contaminant treatment technologies, improved technologies/methods addressing more stringent regulations, and the assessment of Air Force-wide impacts from future, or changing regulations regarding the detection and treatment of emerging contaminants in soils and groundwater. Example emerging contaminants of interest include but are not limited to: 1,4-dioxane, perfluorinated compounds, hexavalent chromium, chlorinated pesticides, and N-nitrosodimethylamine.<br /><br />b. Priority 2 - Injection Delivery Remediation: Proposals should include innovative methodologies for improved injection delivery of amendments including bio-augmentation, bio-stimulation amendments, in-situ chemical oxidation amendments, and other amendments to increase remediation potential in low-permeability zones. <br /><br />Eligible Offeror/Applicants: This requirement is restricted to US - companies, academic institutions, non-profit institutions, and/or government agencies. Foreign participants and/or individuals may participate as subcontractors to the extent that such participants comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.<br /><br />Acquisition Overview: The BAA is a two-step process that includes two phases of proposal submittals:<br /><br />Phase I - submit a 2 page online form (white paper/pre-proposal) at <br /><a href="http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa">http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa</a> <br /><br />Phase II - if invited, submit a full proposal that details the technology, the demonstration, and validation approach, and the costs for the proposed effort. <br />Relevant forms, samples and guides are found on FedBizOps and the AFCEE BAA Website. Evaluation criteria for Phase I are included in the proposal instruction document provided in this announcement. The anticipated award of AFCEEBAA-12-001 is Fiscal Year 12, 3rd Quarter. <br /><br />How to Apply: All Phase I white papers/pre-proposals must be submitted as an online form and can be accessed through AFCEE's website (http://www.afcee.lackland.af.mil/contracting/baa.)

<p>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4514</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /><br /></strong>Contracting Office Address: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4114. Point of Contact: Ashley VanDenTop, Contract Specialist, Phone 315-330-4457, Email: <a href="mailto:Ashley.VanDenTop@rl.af.mil">Ashley.VanDenTop@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p>AFRL Rome has a requirement to conduct software development and system support for the Air Space Precision Engagement Research and Engineering (ASPERE). ASPERE supports Air Force efforts in providing Air Force, Department of Defense, Intelligence Community (IC), other Federal Agencies, and Coalition partners with a software toolkit that provides a general data visualization and analysis infrastructure for the analysis of temporal, spatial, entity, and association information, report generation, incident reporting, workflow, and query/search. Web-Enabled Temporal Analysis System (WebTAS), Combined Information Data Network Exchange (CIDNE), and International Distributed Uniform Reporting Environment (INDURE) make up the primary software applications in the ASPERE toolset. The flexible toolset architecture provides access to multiple data sources, data mining, information fusion, and collaboration tools that facilitate trend, link, pattern, and distributed analysis to support activity prediction and customer unique capabilities like Strategic Worldwide Integration Capability (SWIC), Common Analytical Work Station (CAWS) and Master Air Attach Plan (MAAP) Toolkit. This effort will perform engineering and technical tasks and operations and maintenance support for current and new users of the ASPERE software toolset. Technical enhancements are needed to correct any identified shortcomings in the toolset and to provide additional capabilities, features, processes, and documentation. The enhancements will extend ASPERE toolset functions and provide more effective and efficient capabilities to meet the needs of the users. Due to real world events, rapid software releases (currently every ninety (90) days) are required to maximize the Government's technological capabilities at current and future deployed sites, worldwide. Installation support will be needed to install the ASPERE toolset software and hardware, and train users at multiple sites throughout the world. For example, sites such as CENTCOM, which involve contingency operations and quick response to warfighter needs will require this installation support. Operations and maintenance actions will be needed to provide continued system support to current customer sites and to the new sites after system installation. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various DoD and Government agencies through visits and electronic means, and technical visits that will take place at various sites, worldwide. The contractor will also provide technical engineering expertise to the Air Force Research Lab/Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division to perform analysis, design, development, integration, testing, and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software, hardware, and technical documentation.</p>
<p>An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. Taking into consideration the real world events currently unfolding, the Government presently contemplates the maximum ordering amount to be approximately $593,000,000.00 for this 60 month ordering period.</p>
<p>The prime contractor and their subcontractors for this contract must have approximately four-hundred (400) Top Secret SCI security clearances; foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level shall not be permitted for this effort. The successful contractor may receive and/or generate technical data subject to export control in the performance of the contract. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. The successful offeror must have a completed and approved DD Form 2345 prior to award. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. In reference to the ASPERE effort, information can be obtained by contacting Government Program Manager, Mr Michael Welch, at (315) 330-7758, who will forward a copy of the ASPERE Read Library. Data contained within the read library is subject to export control restrictions. Access to ASPERE toolset Source Code is available at AFRL/RIEB, Rome, NY location only. Please contact Mr. Welch five (5) business days in advance to arrange a time to review the code. Prior to access being granted, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, (may be obtained at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/default.asp) along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library or source code, to the Government Program Manager at the Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4505, or fax to his attention at (315) 330-3913.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the small business capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this effort is 541712 and the small business standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />A Draft Request for Proposal will not be posted for this effort. The solicitation is expected to be released approximately three (3) months from this notice. Refer to the web link of this notice for any milestone updates.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 15.202 - Multi-Step Process, the following information is provided for requesting capabilities and experience for the execution of multiple Basic Ordering Agreements for EAGLE requirements:<br><br>All contractor submissions must be e-mailed to USARMY.RIA.ACC.MBX.EAGLE@mail.mil NLT 1600 CST, 12 January 2012.  Any questions regarding this request should also be submitted to this e-mail address.  This notice is also being posted to the EAGLE website: http://www.aschq.army.mil/ac/aaisdus/EAGLE.aspx.<br><br>Although this is a voluntary step, all contractors are strongly encouraged to submit the requested information. <br><br>BOA Step 1 Scope Functional Areas<br><br>1. EAGLE Scope.<br>The US Army Materiel Enterprise has a requirement for full-service prime contractors to provide an integrated approach for global logistics services in support of missions such as, but not limited to; Directorates of Logistics (DOL) installations; Army Prepositioned Stocks (APS); Theater Provided Equipment (TPE); In-Theater Maintenance; Left Behind Equipment (LBE); Pre-Deployment Training Equipment (PDTE); New Equipment Training (NET); New Equipment Fielding (NEF); and Reset within the United States and OCONUS locations. The objective of the acquisition is to provide global logistics services, primarily Materiel Maintenance Services, Retail/Wholesale Supply Services, and Transportation Support Services, that meet the Army's logistics mission needs in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. The EAGLE requirements do not include plans/operations as a separate requirement, laundry/dry cleaning, dining facilities, or aviation maintenance.<br><br>In the past, many installations placed separate contracts for maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The EAGLE acquisition strategy centralizes functional responsibility, eliminates redundancy, and maximizes efficiency by combining these three EAGLE functions into one requirement. In other words, when installation level logistics are solicited as an EAGLE requirement, award will result in a single logistics provider prime contractor responsible for all identified maintenance, supply, and transportation support services. The installations that have logistic requirements other than those within the three EAGLE functional areas may or may not have one single logistics provider performing this work. For example, the successful maintenance, supply and transportation support prime contractor for the Detroit Arsenal DOL, may or may not be the same contractor performing other potential requirements at Warren, MI.<br><br>1.1 EAGLE Functional Areas. The EAGLE functional requirements involve field level logistics and sustainment. Examples include but are not limited to the following:<br><br>1.1.1. Material Maintenance (North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 811118*): Examples of types of requirements are, but not limited to; Installation Materiel Maintenance Activity Operations, Installation Modification Work Order and Warranty program coordination, Equipment Condition Classification, Base Operation Equipment Maintenance (i.e. construction equipment, emergency equipment, etc.,)Tactical Equipment Maintenance (i.e. armament, combat platforms, ground support equipment), Corrosion Protection Programs, Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) program, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS). <br><br>1.1.2. Retail/Wholesale Supply (NAICS Code 493190*): Examples of types of requirements are, but not limited to; Supply Support Activity Management (Classes of Supply include I, II, IIIP, IV, VII and IX), Central Issue Facility Operations, Individual Chemical Equipment Management Program (ICEMP), Property Accountability, Ammunition Supply Operations and Ammunition Supply Point (ASP) Management, Installation Property Book and Equipment Management, Fuel Support (CL III Bulk), Central Receiving Point, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).<br><br>1.1.3. Transportation Support (NAICS Code 488999*): Examples of types of requirements are - Central Travel Office, Non-tactical Equipment Management, License Equipment Operators, Railroad Operations, Household Goods Operations, Personnel & Cargo movement (Shipping and Receiving Point), Local Drayage Operations, Movement planning and Transportation Motor Pool Operations, Unit movement planning, Arrival and Departure Control Group (ADG), Installation Transportation Office, and use of applicable Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS)/Army Information Systems (AIS).<br><br>*Individual industry NAICS codes are identified as references only.<br><br>As contemplated, the EAGLE contract will be solicited under the NAICS Code 561210, Facilities Support Services.<br><br>BOA Step 1 Submission Instructions<br><br>1.0 Format for Submissions<br>Potential Offerors for the EAGLE acquisition are requested to provide the information outlined below.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the DFRC SecuritySupport Services Contract for a maximum of three months (January 1, 2012 - March 31,2012).	A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issued on or beforeDecember 31, 2011, which is the expiration date of the current security support servicescontract. NASA DFRC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04AC17D,for protective services which was awarded November 1,2004, as a result of full and opencompetition under a GSA Schedule to Wackenhut Services, Inc. (WSI)(named changed to G4SGovernment Solutions Inc. (G4S) in October 2011). This extension is necessary to bridgethe performance period between the end of the current contract and award of a new NASADryden Protective Service contract. Authorization of this extension has been issued byNASA Headquarters under Procurement Information Circular (PIC)11-08, dated October 25,2011, which provides a class deviation from the requirements of FAR 17.204(e) and NASAFAR Supplement (NFS) 1817.204(e)(iii), limiting the terms of service contracts to five(5) years, including the basic contract and all options. This class deviation appliesonly to existing contract requirements that will ultimately be provided under a new NASADryden Protective Services Contract. NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full andOpen Competition provided by 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), because G4S Government Solutions Inc.(G4S) possesses unique expertise in meeting the security requirements of the Center, noalternate source could adequately provide for the maintenance of the Centerscomprehensive security program during this extension period. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon December 2, 2011. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST bein writing and should be directed to Mr. Medina not later than 4:30 p.m. local time onDecember 2, 2011. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The installation Ombudsman is is Mr.Patrick C. Stoliker, (661) 276-2076 or patrick.c.stoliker@nasa.gov. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The USGS requires an instrument capable of analysis of deuterium: hydrogen and 18 Oxygen: 16 Oxygen of matrix water in liquid, vapor, and in soil, plant or similar types via absorption spectrometry.  Major uses will include determination of how plants differ in effective rooting depth and the isotopic composition of free and matrix water in soils, stems, and, and precipitation, and the isotopic variation of water will be used to evaluate climate effects on water resources.  At a minimum all offered equipment must generate D:H and 18:16O ratios on the water in liquids, vapor, soil, plant, or other organic samples in real time, be capable of high-throughput (>50 samples per day), soil or plant samples inserted directly into instrument without headspace equilibration or any preparatory cryogenic-extraction from samples, operate with small amount of water in samples down to <10 microliter for studies of arid land plants,  foot print cannot exceed 24 X 24, must be portable (less than 50 lbs.), optional field settings, automated identification of organic contaminants and ability to apply corrective compensations for the effect of organic contaminants on the resulting data, meet industry standards of <.01% for Delta 18O (max) and <.0.5% (max) for Delta  D based on VSMOW scales for reporting deuterium and oxygen isotopes.  
Based on the above requirements, we intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with Picarro Inc., Santa Clara, CA , in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b) and the procedures in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.

<DESC>These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The services will consist of site planning, engineering studies, conceptual design, final design, cost estimating, and construction phase services for projects.  The primary purpose of these contracts is to provide services for projects located within the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  Secondarily, the contracts may be used to provide services within the geographic boundaries of the other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers districts within the South Atlantic Division.  The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the geographic boundaries of the Jacksonville District.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts.  Only firms considered highly qualified will be awarded a contract.  Indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders.  This announcement will result in up to two (2) awards.  Criteria used in allocating task orders among contracts include performance and quality of deliverables under current task orders, current capacity to accomplish the order in the required time, specialized experience, equitable distribution of the work among the contractors, and other relevant factors.  The contracts will be for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years; not to exceed a total of five years.  While the estimated dollar amount per year is $1,000,000.00, the actual obligation per year may be greater than or less than the $1,000,000.00.  Maximum order limit is $5,000,000 for the life of the contract, including options.  Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 50.0% to small business concerns; 17.0% to small disadvantaged business concerns; 18.0% to women-owned small business concerns; 10.0% for HUBZone concerns; 4.0% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business; and 8.5% to veteran-owned small business.  The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages.  Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socioeconomic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  A firm must also be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation.

MiSeq personal sequencing system - This system utilizes sequencing by synthesis technology to sequence small genomes, transcriptomes, and other sequencing requirements.  In this process, starting nucleic acid sample is reverse transcribed and/or fragmented, and sequencer-specific adaptors are ligated onto the fragments.  Millions of labeled fragments are then sequenced using fluorescently labeled, reversible terminator-bound dNTPs.<br>b.	Genome Analyzer (GA) - This sequencing system is similar to the MiSeq, but there is significantly increased throughput of up to 95 gigabases with up to 640 million paired-end reads.<br>  Supplies required<br>a.  Library preparation kits - For sequencing, we require an Illumina-compatible library preparation kit.<br>1.	TruSeq DNA and RNA Sample Prep Kits generate DNA libraries from DNA or RNA appropriate for Illumina-based sequencing.  The resulting libraries are 300-500 base pairs for single, paired-end, and multiplexed sequencing.  There are two sets with unique indices so multiple, separate libraries can be indexed for one sequencing run.  The TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kit is used to generate sequencable libraries from small RNA starting material.  The TruSeq Dual Index Sequencing Primer Kit, Paired End, is used for sequencing dual index libraries.<br>2.  Nextera DNA sample Preparation Kit and the accompanying Nextera Index Kits are also used to generate sequencable libraries.<br>b. Reagents required for MiSeq system operation<br>1.

TEMS monitors engine performance parameters and stores event and trend data to support management of the TF34 engine. <br />The Supplies/Services include the following:<br />&bull; The Contractor shall inventory and perform acceptance testing on each government-furnished EPU (P/N 9058027-10 in a serviceable condition) upon arrival In Accordance With (IAW) Test Requirement Document (TRD) document number 02-A10DOC-6163. <br />&bull; Production, retrofitting, integration, and testing of up to three-hundred-forty-two (342) Electronic Processor Units (EPU) (PN 9058027-10) to IEPU (PN 200222868-50) units (Group B kits).<br />&bull; Production, retrofitting, integration, and testing of up to thirty-eight (38) IEPUs (PN 200222868-30) units to -50 IEPU (PN 200222868-50) units (Group B kits) <br />&bull; Production and testing of up to three-hundred-eighty (380) IEPU Vibration Card Circuit Assemblies (CCAs), part number 16094-0100-10, to replace all legacy Vibration Cards, part number 91300-301 and 91300-302<br />&bull; Provide repairs for EPU and IEPU hardware<br />&bull; Refurbish and restore all assets provided by the Government to "A Condition"<br />&bull; Provide a fully Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) Technical Order (TO) with complete Bill of Material and detailed electronic schematics that allows for the development of a full Government Organic Depot repair capability for the IEPU -50 CPU CCA. <br />&bull; Provide the Government unlimited data rights in accordance with DFAR 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items to use this TO data in support of organic repair of the IEPU -50 CPU card.
<p>The TEMS ADR modification shall upgrade the current Integrated Exposure and Processing Unit (IEPU) (PN 200222868-30) TEMS/ADR dash 30 to the new IEPU (PN 200222868-50) TEMS/ADR dash 50. The dash 50 IEPU configuration will resolve both obsolescence and reliability challenges with the current dash 30 IEPU. The dash 50 IEPU will provide increased reliability (MTBF) and will provide Ethernet interface needed for future compatibility with the avionics buses. This will also allow for faster data downloads due to the ADR and Real Time Engine Data file sizes. <br />The Contractor may be required to travel to various locations to be determined to support the objectives.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided for planning purposes only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<br>	The Army Contracting Command-Rock Island is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources interested in and capable of providing all the needed labor, equipment, materials, and services to deliver and supply propane gas and contractor-owned propane tanks to the Tooele Army Depot, Utah.  There are 25 propane tanks located throughout the Tooele Army Depot that are owned by the current contractor.  The propane tanks vary in size from 122 gallons to 1000 gallons; please see attachment that provides the sizes and locations.  Coordination of any required "change-out" of the current tanks for tanks provided by any new contractor would be managed by the Tooele Army Depot technical point of contact.  The contractor may be required to place new concrete slabs in order to set replacement contractor-owned propane tanks..  The exchange of propane tanks will need to be completed in a "seamless" manner minimizing any potential for disruption in services to the installation.<br>	The required service will necessitate frequent monitoring of the tanks to ensure adequate fill status.  Tooele Army Depot will require  the tanks to be filled regularly, i.e., maintained at no less than a 50% capacity .  This will require the contractor to fill the tanks at least once per week and in emergency cases.  The estimated total volume needed, based on previous usage, is 60,000-70,000 gallons per year.  The quantity will vary month to month.  An estimated quantity will be requested each month and then invoiced and paid each month based on actual quantity received.  <br>	Interested parties have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item.  Any response to this market survey should reference the following: Propane for Tooele Army Depot.  Please submit to: U.S. Army Contracting Command-Rock Island, ATTN: CCRC-ID, Ms. Alejandra Figueroa and Ms. Vicki Ahlgrim, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Bldg. 60, Rock Island, IL 61299-8000, email: Alejandra.c.figueroa.civ@mail.mil and Vicki.l.ahlgrim.civ@mail.mil.<br>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN-20 VA Healthcare System is requesting information related to vendors capable of providing SURGICAL DRILLS for the Spokane VA Medical Center in Spokane, WA.
 
 This is not a request for bids, quotes, or proposals.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research and obtain information from qualified businesses. The responses to this announcement will assist in determining the socio-economic set aside if feasible. The Veterans Administration is required by Public Law 109-461 to give first priority to SDVOSB and VOSB concerns if there should be sufficient firms available to compete under a set aside. If insufficient veteran owned and small business response is received to establish the basis for setting this action aside for other than large business participation then the action will be advertised as full and open competition, in which case, all interested parties responding shall be eligible to bid.
 
 This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

This sources-sought synopsis is issued in anticipation of a future procurement program. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is conducting market research to determine contractor interest and capability to produce two of the three systems that comprise the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) family of systems (CAT, TWS and AN/SLQ-25X). The two systems on which NAVSEA is requesting information under this synopsis are: (1) Countermeasure, Anti-Torpedo (CAT) and (2) the Torpedo Warning System (TWS). 

Background:  PMS 415 has been tasked to develop a surface ship anti-torpedo hard kill capability for high value unit (HVU) platforms (Carriers and Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships).  This capability will be developed through two separate, but associated programs: the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT).
 The TWS will serve as a standalone detection, alert and tactical control system, and will provide the detection capability necessary for the ship to evade, decoy, or defeat the torpedo using existing or future tactics and countermeasures in addition to the CAT.  The CAT will be developed separately as a hard kill countermeasure.  TWS and CAT are associated but independent acquisition programs, each with its own defined mission.

The TWS will provide a detect-to-launch capability to Fleet units by providing new sensors deployed on a TWS compatible AN/SLQ-25 (called AN/SLQ-25X), additional processing and workstation for operator control and display, and CAT ready stows placed port and starboard.
  The AN/SLQ-25X is not a component of the TWS, but only a tow-point of opportunity to eliminate the need for an additional tow system on the ship. NAVSEA is currently in the evaluation stage of a competitive procurement for AN/SLQ-25X development. Contract award is currently planned for 2nd quarter FY12.

During the engineering and manufacturing development phase the TWS will produce the sensors, algorithms, fire control, and Ready Stow Group for large deck ships as a stand-alone system.  The CAT will continue development as a common counter-measure for all platforms.  As much as possible, at sea testing for TWS and CAT will be combined to minimize cost.

The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and the All-Up Round Equipment (AURE).
  The ATT is a small-diameter, quick-reaction hard-kill torpedo countermeasure for disabling incoming threat torpedoes.  The ATT will search, home, terminal home, and fuse on its target using technology developed under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  It consists of the following major sections: Nose, Warhead, Command & Control, Power Plant and Tail.  The ATT is housed in an AURE, which consists of a thin-walled composite canister, electrical cabling to enable communication between the ATT and fire control, and energetics for launching the ATT.  The resultant capabilities of the SSTD family of systems will be integrated into an open architecture designed system leading to the demonstration of an anti-torpedo detection and track for TWS and hard kill engagement for CAT.
  Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for both TWS and CAT is planned for FY18.  

The objective of the TWS procurement is to field detection, classification, localization, command and control display, operator interface, and automated torpedo alert for surface ship torpedo defense. The future procurement of TWS may result in the award of a single prime contract at the TWS level or multiple contracts at the major module levels described above.  The objective of the CAT procurement is to field a hardkill countermeasure consisting of an all-up-round canister with launch enegretics and an anti-torpedo torpedo (ATT) consisting of the acoustic nose assembly, warhead, command and control section, power plant section and tail section.
 The future procurement of CAT may result in the award of a single prime contract at the CAT level or multiple contracts at the major module levels described above.

The CAT is being developed by Applied Research Laboratory, Penn State University (ARL PSU) and Naval Surface Warfare Command, Indian Head Division (NSWC IHD). The AURE is being developed by Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport Division and SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego. The development includes generation of technical data that will allow potential production contractors to bid a build to print design. 

The ATT is divided into five Major Modules: 

(1) Acoustic Nose Assembly (ANA) -The ANA includes an acoustic array and array processing.
(2) Warhead - The Warhead includes the main charge explosive and the safe and arm electronics.
(3) Command and Control - Command and Control section includes the Guidance and Control electronics vehicle control electronics, power distribution and the thermal battery.
(4) Power Plant - The Power Plant includes a lithium based Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS) Engine, reduction gear, a number of Electro-Explosive Devices for Engine start up and propulsion electronics.
(5) Tail Section - The Tail Section contains control surfaces, Propulsor and Platform Interface electronics for interface to the ships weapon system.
 

The tactical warhead production is planned to be at NSWC IHD and will be supplied to the integrator as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). Part of the build to print technical design work for the ATT is to provide built-in-test and test equipment for both the major module level and CAT level to allow sell off at either level, as well as final test at the CAT level. It also allows for life cycle support of the weapon. The Government Furnished Information (GFI) for the test equipment will be included in the Technical Data Package for either a single contractor or multiple contractors at the major module level.

The scope of this potential program currently is approximately 90 CAT Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units and 750 Production units.
 The government is also looking at other applications for the CAT which may expand its market further. No Foreign Military Sales (FMS) are anticipated at this time.

The CAT software is being developed and will be maintained by ARL PSU. Configuration management of the build to print modules/system will be jointly maintained by the contractor(s) and government (via ARL PSU). Engineering Development Models (EDM) and Prototypes will not be part of the production contractor(s) responsibility. The last EDM built by ARL PSU is planned to be identical to the technical data package issued for LRIP. 
 
The TWS is divided into five Major Modules: 

(1) TWSRA - The TWSRA is the Torpedo Warning System Receive Array which is comprised of a modular TWS Receive Array with a separator cable and inter-module tether cables.
(2) TAAS - The TAAS is a Towed Active Acoustic Source.
(3) TAG & TCG - The TAG is a Target Acquisition Group and TCG is the Tactical Control Group, which consist of Inboard Processors with Displays.
(4) TWSRA and TAAS Power Supplies
(5) RSG - The Ready Stow Group will be used for stowage and necessary shock, IM, and shipboard interfaces for CAT.
 The RSG provides IM protection for the Warhead.

The TWS System shall be integrated with the AN/SLQ-25X which will provide power to the TWSRA and TAAS, as well as, physically tow these arrays. NAVSEA awarded a Phase III SBIR contract to 3Phoenix Corporation on 23 September 2011 for the development of four TWS EDMs. NAVSEA intends to satisfy Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) requirements under a future competitive procurement with offerors proposing in response to a performance specification. Note as the RSG is currently being developed by ARL PSU under their CAT development effort that includes the generation of technical data, NAVSEA expects  to be in a position to allow potential TWS production contractors to bid a build to print design for the RSG component of the TWS system.

The scope of this potential program currently is approximately 4 or 5 LRIP units and 45 Production units (CVN ships - 12, and CLF ships - 33).
 No FMS sales are anticipated at this time. Note: Current delivery projection is 2 or 3 TWS systems per year during the period of 2017-2033).

The Torpedo Warning System Receive Array (TWSRA) component shall be a flexible towed and reelable modular array that receives power through the tow cable. The TWSRA shall transmit received data back through the tow cable for Target Acquisition processing. The Towed Active Acoustic Source (TAAS) component shall be a flexible towed and reelable line array assembly that receives power and transmit information through the tow cable interface.  It is responsible for active transmission from which echoes from targets will be used for target acquisition and alertment.
  The TAAS operation shall provide signal transmit operations in either a pulsed mode or continuous active transmission. The Target Acquisition and Tactical Control Processor component shall be comprised of a set of processors running software that provides detection, localization, state estimation, data fusion, alert generation, tactical recommendations, and displays.  Detection, Localization and classification shall utilize raw sensor data to produce passive and active contacts.  Final integration would be performed at the contractors facility, a government owned facility that is contractor operated (GOCO) or a government owned and operated facility (GOGO). 

Information Requested: Contractors interested in becoming a single prime contractor for the TWS or CAT, or TWS and CAT should discuss their strategies for teaming with subcontractors and successes that have been achieved in this area for similar contract actions.
 Contractors interested in single major module production or multiple major module production should explicitly state which areas they are interested in manufacturing and focus their discussion on their capability to build these modules. The discussion should include recent relevant business experience and their planned approach to meet the requirements stated above. Specifically, firms should discuss their past success with Build to Print contracts (for CAT) or performance based contracts (for TWS) and relevant experience where higher level integration is required after delivery of their assemblies. If the contractor has experience with similar systems that were not build to print, inclusion of this information in the report is also desired.

Interested firms are encouraged to submit a capability summary that does not exceed five (5) pages in length describing production capability and their experience with similar items.
 The capability summary should explicitly state if they are interested in the single prime production contractor role or the major module level production role.

 Responses should include- 
(a) The name, address, cage code, and DUNS number of the contractor and where the CAT or TWS, or CAT and TWS would be built; 
(b) Point of contact including name, title, phone, and email addresses; 
(c) A description of similar or like complexity devices currently offered by the contractor that meet, or with minor modifications might meet, some or all the listed requirements and the required subcontractors as determined.

Mellon Auditorium available to the public under the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976.&nbsp; The&nbsp;contractor is required to advertise the auditorium, book event requests, and provide event-related coordination and services.<br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br /><br />This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services.&nbsp; A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the public to utilize the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium.&nbsp; This extension will provide services without disruption for event management by a vendor that already has significant experience and expertise in administering the contract.&nbsp; The incumbent contractor is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional two-month performance period.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued.&nbsp; However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame, it may give notification via email to Robert Lawrence, Contract Officer, at robert.lawrence@gsa.gov.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></span></p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (NAE) is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement (SSA) for Manufacturers/Suppliers of Applanix POSMV 5 upgrade with POsPac MMS 5.x software to determine the interest, availability and capability of Small Business concerns as described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511.  The estimated cost of this procurement is between $25,000 and $150,000.  The resultant contract vehicle will be a firm fixed price purchase order.  <br><br>The Survey Section currently has a POS MV4 inertial navigation system, originally purchased in conjunction with their Reson 8124 multibeam survey system.  A new Reson 7125 multibeam system was installed replacing their current 8124 system.    The POS MV5 upgrade needs to have a built in RTK GPS option which allows the user to achieve greater accuracy.  In addition, the MV5 will allow post processing of the survey data to be corrected and processed much more accurately, instead of just being able to use the raw collected corrections. The navigation system must include "True Heave" in the processor which significantly improves accuracy.  It is a unique quality control tool for real-time heave during collecting survey data.    The POS MV5 upgrade will allow for quicker, more accurate final processing of the survey data.<br><br>The POS MV4 must be accepted as a trade-in for a new upgraded POS MV5 system and is required to have "true heave" feature so there is no requirement to tune filter for specific conditions, no time required for settling, and data can be smoothed forwards and backwards.  System must include an IMU that is based on fiber optic upgradeable gyro technology.  System must have a roll, heading and pitch accuracy of .01 and maintain data rates up to 200 Hz.  Must have ability to time tag data to microsecond accuracy.  System must be able to achieve decimeter accuracy without the need for base stations.  Processing software must provide decimeter accuracy in x, y, z no matter how far in distance surveying offshore.  <br><br>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.); qualifications and experience in performing the work requirements stated above. Responses are due Friday December 2nd, 2011.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN: Lauren Devin. Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an announcement of a solicitation.  The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  <br>

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA07BB01C for Rotary Wing Engineering,Modeling and Simulation (REMS), with Monterey Technologies, Inc. (MTI) on a sole-sourcebasis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of AmesResearch Centers (ARC) Code A, Office of the Director of Aeronautics.	The objective isto extend the performance period for six months.The current contractor provides mission critical research in new utilizations andefficiencies in the National Airspace System (NextGen) to enable extensive vertical lifttransportation capability, develop critical technologies for more efficient, faster,productive and safe rotary wing vehicles, and allow other U.S. agencies such asDepartment of Defense (DOD) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to meet uniquecritical technology needs in rotorcraft development and utilization.   ARC is the onlyNASA center that has a contract to support rotary wing technology research.  Currentcontract has approximately 50% of the tasks from NASA, 40% from Army, 8% from FAA, and 2%from the Navy.	The REMS provides rotary support to:	- Rotary Wing aeromechanics modeling and analysis	- Simulation Facility hardware and software development for experimental research	- Aircraft performance, handling qualities, cockpit displays, and flight controlsystems 	- Distributed and non-distributed models and simulation information technology	- Human-in-the-loop simulation research and development, test, evaluation andtraining	- Mission effectiveness analysis, modeling and simulation, and program analysisand     management	- Air traffic management development and assessment of new operating proceduresand     interfacesThis extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure program continuity andcritical mission support and to avoid significant technical impacts while a competitivefollow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, IDIQNNA07BB01C, for a period of six months, from April 4 April 2012 through 3 October 2012.The current contractor, MTI, is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needsgiven the short period of performance for the extension. Awarding a 6 month contract toanother source would affect the continuity of services and cause unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs requirements. The proposed contract action is for research and development for which the Governmentintends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.The purpose of this action is to extend the performance period for six months, until suchtime as the small business, set-aside follow-on acquisition is completed. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Nothwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on 5 December 2011. Such communication ofcapabilities/qualifcations will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONfor SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:  _11/17/2011 (rev)                             PR Number: ___R2722120001___________	
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):
Est. $50,000
This requirement is for an ongoing maintenance and functionality of a wide range of data, course content, course delivery, server access, program support, and help-desk support for the National Park Service's Office of Learning and Development and other offices and program areas within the NPS.   The Eppley Institute for Parks and Public Lands,  Indiana University provides these services as a result of a long term collaborative relationship with the NPS under several Cooperative Agreements.  During this time the Eppley Institute has performed extensive course development, server development, data management and migrations, research on technical competencies, data-base development, and an advanced capacity in help-desk services needed to assure effective use of these diverse programs. As part of their cooperative partnerships the majority of the content, design, and research results related to coursework have been copyrighted by Eppley and Indiana University, and the NPS uses this wide range of materials in several program areas with their permission to support and maintain the included functions.  
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
___XX___	Only one responsible source. 
Eppley Institute (Eppley) for Parks and Public Lands, Indiana University is the only one responsible source for this short term requirement for ongoing maintenance and functionality of a wide range of data, course content, course delivery, server access, program support, and help-desk support for the National Park Service's Office of Learning and Development and other offices and program areas within the NPS.   Eppley's unique ability to provide these services is a result of a long term collaborative relationship with the NPS under several Cooperative Agreements and only existing hardware and online content available to be applied immediately to delivering these requirements. In addition to being the only source for this hardware infrastructure and content, past performance has shown that Eppley can establish successful course development, server development, data management and migrations, online links and connectivity, research on technical competencies, data-base development, and an advanced capacity in help-desk services needed to assure effective ongoing use of these diverse programs. As part of their cooperative partnerships the majority of the content, design, and research results related to coursework have been copyrighted by Eppley and Indiana University, and the NPS uses this wide range of materials in several program areas with their permission to support and maintain the included functions.  
There is a need for this support and training, as without it the NPS will not be able to meet the Department of Interior requirement to address a broad range of needs in training and programmatic support that will impact both NPS employees, park visitors, and the general public.  Products and services included in this award will allow NPS uninterrupted support of a broad range of key programs while suitable options are developed for the long-term future. Eppley also has the permission of the Department of Interior learning management system Data Steward to have access for creating and hosting e-courses on DOI Learn.  Without this award, the listed elements currently hosted by Eppley will be shut down and no longer available to the NPS audiences/programs they serve. 
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
Market research was not performed for the reasons stated above and that no other source exists that has the hardware (servers, configurations, internet access protocols), content, and software needed to meet this need.  In Eppley Institute is a nationally recognized leader in the area of adult learning, training functions, online coursework best practices, and educational design.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and IMF (PSNSY) have a requirement to renew the maintenance and support of the Business Objects Software for the Regional Maintenance Centers to support AIM4RMC.  The Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI)has been implemented at PSNSY.

The Navy's policy requires the use of only Department of Navy Application and Database Management System (DADMS) approved software to be installed on NMCI workstations.  Business Objects Software is "Approved" in DADMS.  PSNS presently uses this software and needs to renew maintenance support for FY12.  For consistency of operation and efficiency of use, PSNSY requires compatibility of this software.

Therefore, to maintain software compatibility and in accordance with the Navy policy and DADMS approval, procurement is brand specific to the specified software.

<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.eb.mil. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.eb.mil is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

<a href="mailto:giuseppe.tropiano@us.army.mil">Giuseppe Tropiano</a>
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Picatinny, Picatinny NJ on behalf of Benet Laboratories intends to award a sole source contract with Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp., Summit Office Park, West Building, 300 Centerville Road, Suite 209W, Warwick, RI 02886-0201.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 511210 and the small business size standard in dollars is $25 million.
The Government has a need to purchase a suite of ABAQUS software applications that will meet Benet Laboratories engineering requirements for finite element analysis and computer aided engineering requirements for analyzing and modeling large caliber cannon.  This application of a standard set of pre- and post-processing application tools for each analysis engine allows a cross-collaboration between engineers and designers using a common set of software application tools.  The following is an itemized list of the Abaqus software application configurations needed to support this objective:  55 Analysis Tokens consisting of Abaqus/Foundation, Abaqus/AMS, parallel execution, Co-simulation Engine, Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian Analysis  12 month lease;  10 Abaqus/CAE Seats  12 month lease;  1 Pro/Engineer Associative Interface  12 month lease; 1 fe-safe  12 month lease.  This proposed contract action requires Dassault to supply ABAQUS software applications so that substantial duplication costs are not incurred by the Government.  
AUTHORITY: This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government; but this notice of intent, is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. The closing date for this synopsis is 9 December 2011 no later than 4:30PM Eastern Standard Time. The anticipated award date is 14 December 2011. The point of contact for this requirement is Giuseppe Tropiano, ACC-NJ-JA, Bldg. 40, Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet NY 12189-4000.  Email: giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil 
APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: Request to award this requirement to Dassault Systemes Simulia Corp. since Dassault is the only vendor that sells and distributes Abaqus Licensing. Within the past 10 years Dassault Systems Simulia Corp. alone was responsible for all of Benet Laboratories Abaqus software support.  This sole source position is predicated on Dassault Systems Simulia Corporation being the only manufacture, developer and provider of Abaqus software and software support.  Abaqus is an essential tool for the scientists and engineers at Benet Laboratories.

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Past Performance <br />ii. Price</p>
<p><br />Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government intends to award contract to offeror which represents best overall value in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history and price will be considered. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to ALL solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. The government reserves the right to reject any offer that does not meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --</p>
<p>(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and</p>
<p>(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:</p>
<p>(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;</p>
<p>(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;</p>
<p>(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov ; or</p>
<p>(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. IAW FAR 13.106-2 The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government.</p>
<p>Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation will not be considered.</p>
<p>Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information as stated above. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance rating of "Sufficient Past Performance" or "Limited Past Performance". Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUFFICIENT PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN PAST PERFORMANCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>e. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance."</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Limited Past Performance" or when it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" rating, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Sufficient Past Performance" performance rating or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions.</p>

These forms or other information required for the background investigation shall be submitted to the POC within three weeks of notification of contract award, or as requested by the POC. Forms to be provided by POC after contract award, if applicable.<br />All Contractor employees may undergo a background investigation, the scope of which will be determined by the FBI, and may require a polygraph examination, before access to the FBI facility will be permitted. The FBI will have full and complete control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating access for contractor employees. At the discretion of the FBI, Contractor personnel may be interviewed by the FBI regarding foreign travel, associates, residences or other matters of concern to the FBI in deciding whether to grant access to its facilities or property. Refusal or failure to accurately complete the required forms, to be interviewed, etc. to resolve any questionable matters will be deemed reasonable cause for denial of access to FBI facilities.<br />If for any reason a Contractor employee is denied access to any FBI facility, the FBI will not disclose to the Contractor the reason for denial, nor will the FBI be liable for any expense in the replacement of the individual or any costs incurred by the Contractor as a result of such denial.<br />The FBI reserves the right to revoke any Contractor's employee access to its facilities or property where such access is no longer clearly consistent with the FBI's mission and responsibilities. The Contractor agrees to immediately remove that individual from the FBI facility in such circumstances. In cases of access revocation, the FBI will inform<br />the individual of the basis for the revocation unless to do so would reveal classified or sensitive information, and give the individual an opportunity to explain, rebut or refute such basis in writing. Access will remain revoked pending prompt review of any such submission by the individual.<br />2) Access to FBI facilities, if required, is subject to specific security requirements, which must be satisfied prior to access. The FBI will furnish badges authorizing escorted or unescorted access to FBI facilities, if required. Badges will be kept at a location to be determined by the FBI and shall be picked up upon arrival at FBI premises by the Contractor employees granted access. Badges shall be worn at all times on the upper part of the body so as to be clearly visible and will be returned to the FBI whenever the wearer leaves FBI premises for any reason or any length of time.<br />3) Any information technology system utilized to support unclassified<br />contract performance, if applicable, shall be operated in accordance with FBI certification and accreditation policies and procedures. The contractor shall identify in their RFQ response of any information technology system needed to support this requirement, if applicable. Specific questions regarding this process can be made to the Security<br />Division, Ms. Joann Saunders at 202-324-9230 as to the required certification and accreditation process.</p>

                                                  STATEMENT OF WORK                                   Electronic Subscription Services for NFPA codes.INTRODUCTION: The National Park Service (NPS), Fire Management Program Office (FMPC), 3833 S. Development Ave. Boise, ID 83705, is looking to establish a Three (3) year Blanket Purchase Agreement 
DESCRIPTION: The National Park Service (NPS), Structure Fire Program National Office, 3833 S. Development Ave. Boise, ID 83705, requires subscription service for electronic access to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes, standards, and recommended practices.
Unlimited access to the codes (not to exceed 50 at any given time) is desired for all NPS parks and units though the expected usage should break down as follows:(a)Fifteen full time users will need to access the codes daily or at least weekly and who need to be able to download codes from the website on to their PCs.(b)Twenty-five people, will access the codes monthly and would occasionally, download a code or two that pertains to their discipline.(c) One-hundred and twenty-five people will access the codes a minimum of three times per year and may not download any codes.
SCOPEThe National Park Service manages 391 unique national parks, historic sites, monuments, and other units throughout the United States and its territories.  With few exceptions these sites do not have a professional fire inspector or a design engineer assigned to them.  Most code enforcement and interpretation happens at the regional and national level.  Parks do have trained Park Structural Fire Coordinators (PSFCs) who are responsible for fire code inspections. With few exceptions if they have a question requiring research into the codes they would ask their Regional Structural Fire Manager (RSFM) who would do the research for them.   The same 	holds true with design of new and altered buildings.  Of these 391 parks 21 of them have some sort of internal fire brigade who would occasionally access the fire codes.  Online usage rates would be expected to be extremely low with the exception of the 15 or so persons identified above.NFPA is an international non-profit organization responsible for developing over 300 consensus codes and standards intended to minimize the effects of fire and other risks.  The codes are designed to minimize the risk and effects of fire by establishing criteria for building, processing,design, service, and installation in the United States.  These codes are written through consensus using over 200 technical code- and standard- development committees which are comprised of over 6,000 volunteer seats. Volunteers vote on proposals and revisions in a 	process that is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).NFPA has been adopted by the NPS through Directors Order 58.Access to the codes will include view and search functions as well as an ability to download the codes and standards to the user's computer or printer. 
DELIVERABLES:NFPA will provide unlimited access to their codes which includes unlimited ability to download codes.  Access will be set at 50 users for any given time for the duration of this five year BPA.  
DATA AND MATERIALS TO BE PROVIDED BY NPS:The NPS will provide: 1.  An secured intranet site in which to place the web address site link onto2. Assurance that only NPS employees and partners will have access to the codes3. Computers and equipment to access the web based fire codes.
DATA AND MATERIALS TO BE PROVIDED BY CONTRACTOR:NFPA will provide:1.A web link for the codes to be placed on our secure intranet site.2.Unlimited access per this scope.3.Monitoring of usage and a report of hours used in order to negotiate for out- year service prices.

NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation. In addition, Quoting Contractors are instructed to complete and submit the attached past performance survey (found on the NECO site) with submitted quotes prior to the closing date of this notice specified herein.

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes.  

     (i)  Technically acceptable
    (ii)  Price

(b)  Only those Quoting Contractors which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii).  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without discussions with Quoting Contractors.  Each initial quote should, therefore contain the Quoting Contractors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  


(f)  A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. 

The PCA East Office is soliciting quotes for a contractor to provide remote installation, training and troubleshooting for Radiologica Full Access or equivalent radiation software. It is up to the vendor to demonstrate that the proposed software is equivalent to Full Access. Additionally, the vendor will provide a detailed work plan and briefing to address the tasks and deliverables specified in the Statement of Work (below). The following Contract Line Item is relevant to this procurement: CLIN 0001. Period of Performance: Three months following the date of award. This solicitation will result in a firm fixed-price contract. This procurement will be made using the cascading method. The cascading method is specified as follows:

1. Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence: 

1.1. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms. 

1.2. If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern. 

1.3. If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an 8a or HubZone small business concern. 

1.4. If there is inadequate competition for award to an 8a or HubZone concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5. 

1.5. If there is inadequate competition for award to a small business concern, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all responsive offers submitted by responsible business concerns. 

2. Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if- 

2.1 At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and 

2.2. Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-6. No price evaluation adjustments will be made.

3. When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive offer is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the offer(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the offer from the SDVOSB business will then be included with SB offer(s) received; finally, if there is inadequate competition at the SB tier, the SDVOSB offer will be included with all responsive offers.

Is the bolt slot 5 1/8" long on the mini-matrix?<br /><br />Answer: (3) <br /><br />The bolt slot should be between 5" to 5 1/8" long and 3/16" wide. The square openings for the carriage bolts should also be 3/16" square.<br /><br />Question: (4) <br /><br />On the Matrix and Mini-Matrix, I do not see the definition of Note 1 which seems to describe the stamped name. Do you know what the note says?<br /><br />Answer: (4) <br /><br />The Stamping on the Matrix and Mini-Matrix should be as follows:<br />Mitchell's Matrix (M&sup2;) ATF Patent#_____.<br />The patent number will be provided upon awarding of the contract</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt">Please be advised, this is a synopsis, NOT a solicitation. <br /><br />CBP intends to award a sole source contract to Chenega Technology Services Corporation (CTSC) as a bridge procurement for program management and integrated logistics support (ILS) services to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for managing, controlling, and securing our Nation's borders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;The anticipated period of performance for this requirement&nbsp;is&nbsp;a 6-month base period with 6 one-month option periods.&nbsp;</span>CTSC and its subcontractors will be required to provide support for technically-complex and high-value inspection, detection, and surveillance equipment systems currently used by CBP/ETP to assist in securing the land border crossings, airports, seaports, rail crossings, mail handling, and express cargo consignment facilities within the United States and participating countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Background: The current and future demands of a highly mobile, resource limited, Forward Operating Base (FOB) Camp call for new/advancements in technologies for wastewater treatment. The Government must continue to improve and optimize its water management to meet mission requirements. The need for reductions in the water supply burden of FOB operations and the safe discharge of wastewater require innovative technologies with the capability to treat gray (i.e., shower water reuse system concentrate) and black water (i.e., kitchen and toilet) so that it can be discharged into the environment, thus eliminating the need for waste hauling. <br> <br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for a low-waste generation, energy efficient, gray and black wastewater treatment system that can, at a minimum, be used to support a Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOB during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br> <br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013). <br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through  2013 is $1.75M. The estimated maximum funding available for each fiscal year of the project is $470,000 in Fiscal Year 2012 and $1,280,000 in Fiscal Year 2013. Funds which are not expended in a given fiscal year are available in the subsequent years of the project, subject to fund type restrictions. <br> <br>Multiple Awards: The Government anticipates awarding up to two (2) contracts as a result of this topic. <br> <br>Potential offerors should access the full topic description, terms and conditions, and proposal submission instructions by clicking the link below or copying and pasting the following: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/baa/05RBAA1/05RBAA1.htm  <br> <br>Proposals that reflect a partial solution to the technical objective and description are not acceptable.

<DESC>Background: Potable water and gray water (wastewater that does not contain body or food wastes, i.e., from showers and washing machines.) account for a substantial percentage of the logistics support convoys in current Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). Therefore, reducing water demand, by treating gray water and reclaiming potable water, is needed to reduce the number of convoys necessary to bring in potable water and remove gray water. Water logistics plays an increasing role at the tactical edge, where small FOBs are regularly distributed throughout remote regions. <br> <br>Objective: Under this topic, the Government invites proposals for water recycle/reuse technology that will, at a minimum, improve the water efficiency at Platoon-sized (50 personnel) FOBs during expeditionary operations. The technologies used in the system shall be scalable such that a system that can support a Company-sized (150 personnel) FOB can be developed using the same technologies. <br> <br>Period of Performance: The scope of this effort is such that we anticipate a potential duration of twenty-four (24) months (fiscal year 2012 to 2013).<br><br>Funding: The maximum government funding available in Fiscal Years 2012 through  2013 is $1.75M.

<DESC>RFI Purpose
<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is issuing this request for information (RFI) as part of its market research efforts to identify potential sources with the technical capabilities in the area of design and deployment of "cloud" infrastructure. The objective of this RFI is to ascertain the level of capabilities and availability of potential vendors to provide infrastructure-as-a-service or platform-as-a-service for hosting the Department's mission critical financial management system: the Education Department's Central Automated Processing System (EDCAPS). Much like other federal agencies, the Department needs to continue providing effective information technology in support of the mission and work of the agency while facing the possibility of budget constraints and significantly fewer resources over the next few years. In anticipation of both an expected decrease in resources and the impending end of life for major elements of its existing EDCAPS infrastructure, the Department is assessing its options to transform its current environment into one that is more cost-effective, sustainable, and aligned with future business needs.</p>
<p>Important Note:<br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is issued to support the Department's market research efforts and is solely for information and planning purposes. Any response to this RFI is purely voluntary and will be treated as information only. The Department assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred by any company responding to this RFI. The information provided may be used by the Department of Education in the development of its acquisition strategy and any related statement of work, statement of objectives, or performance specifications. If the Department decides to pursue a formal procurement action to obtain the services described herein, it will do so through the issuance of a formal request for proposal (RFP) or some similar formal document. Because this is an RFI requesting voluntary responses, companies that do not respond to this RFI will not be precluded from responding to any future formal RFP, if one is issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background<br />In order to gain greater control over and accountability for Department resources and meet a variety of legislative mandates, the Department developed EDCAPS, an integrated financial management system consisting of five (5) components: (1) Financial Management Support Software (FMSS), (2) G5 Grants Management System, (3) Contracts and Purchasing Support System (CPSS), (4) Travel Management System (TMS), and (5) Nortridge Loan System (NLS), each of which is described in further detail below.EDCAPS Systems</p>
<p>Figure 1 in the attached MS Word version provides a schematic of how the five (5) EDCAPS system are functionally integrated. <br /><br />The EDCAPS systems are linked through custom interfaces to provide the Department with real-time financial management capabilities that must be maintained regardless of where the systems reside. EDCAPS serves the entire Department of Education's approximately 4,200 internal users in various buildings located in Washington D.C., as well as 10 regional offices across the United States. EDCAPS also serves approximately 100,000 external users through G5. Because EDCAPS is a mission critical system, it must be available at least 99.99% of the time.</p>
<p>Financial Management Support System (FMSS)</p>
<p>FMSS is provided by Oracle Financials version 11.5.10 (11i). It is the Department's official general ledger and also includes functionality for budget planning and execution, funds control, receipt management, administrative payment management, internal and external reporting. The external reports include the financial statements mandated by the Chief Financial Officer's Act. The Department has also implemented the Hyperion Budget Planning module and is currently considering its options for upgrading to Oracle's version Release 12 of their federal financial management system.<br />Contracts and Purchasing Support System (CPSS)</p>
<p>CPSS supports the pre-award and post-award processes for all types of contracts, delivery orders, task orders, interagency agreements, small purchases and purchase card transactions. Requirements maybe consolidated at any level and multiple awards may be made from a single requirement. Awards are modified financially or administratively as necessary, until closed in CPSS. CPSS uses various means of posting and receiving procurement data and future enhancements will add web-based procurements. CPSS interfaces with FMSS, in real time, at the detail level, for funds check, commitments, and obligations. Batch files are exchanged for vendors, accounting codes, and purchase card payment files. Transactions includea combination of sub-procurement lines, multiple accounting lines and incremental funding. Data is stored to meet all Federal Government mandated reporting requirements such as the Federal Procurement Data System. The Department currently employs CACI, Inc.'s Comprizon.Suite as the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software package to provide CPSS functionalitybut has plans to replace the current CPSS system over the next several years.<br />G5</p>
<p>G5 supports the Department's management of more than 10,000 discretionary grants, amounting to approximately $2.1 billion per fiscal year, as well as Formula and Block grants totaling more than $15.2 billion each fiscal year. The Department also disburses approximately $28 billion annually in grants and loans to approximately 14,000 recipient institutions. G5 handles grant planning, pre-award, award management and post-award of the Department programs including discretionary, formula, fellowship, and block grants. G5 also interfaces with other program office systems, referred to as program feeder systems, to process obligation and payment data. The program feeder systems typically support the planning, scheduling, and award processes performed by the program offices to manage their programs (e.g., Campus-Based and Pell). G5 includes functionality for preparing and submitting grant applications electronically and interfaces with Grants.gov Find and Apply functionality for programs using standard forms. G5 allows peer reviewers to electronically review applications submitted electronically to the Department, in their homes or offices. It also allows them to record their evaluations and scores and submit the same to ED electronically. This system affords Department staff the capability to maintain quality control by monitoring the reviewers' progress during the review process. Grantees are able to prepare and submit their Annual Grant Performance Reports to the Department via the Internet. G5 controls payments for the Department's programs, including payments for grants and direct loans and other program-related obligations. It also serves as a subsidiary to the FMSS general ledger for program-related obligations, payments, and expenditures, and interfaces with FMSS at the summary level for funds control and general ledger postings. <br />In 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated the Department of Education as a Grants Management Line of Business (GMLoB) Consortia Lead. In this role, the Department provides structure, leadership and governance support for the development and on-going maintenance of the Department Consortia solution, G5. G5 is available to other Federal Government Agencies as a shared-service, end-to-end grants management solution. Current plans include transitioning G5 to a fully enabled Federal cloud computing solution consistent with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition for cloud computing. It is anticipated that future enhancements to the current G5 provisioning capabilities will be needed to fully meet this objective. <br />The G5 system was custom developed for the Department using WebSphere Portal and Process Servers, Java, and Oracle. COGNOS is used for reporting. The final phase of G5 was recently put into production. The Department expects the G5 system to stabilize over the next six (6) to twelve (12) months.<br />Nortridge Loan System (NLS)</p>
<p>The Nortridge Loan System (NLS) is a commercial-off-the-shelf loan-servicing financial package that accommodates the Department's specialized needs for the following:<br />&bull; Promissory note functionality (Administrative Receivables)<br />&bull; Escrow functionality (Administrative Receivables)<br />&bull; Summary level recording of the Department's four Facility Loans Programs: the College Housing Loan program, the College Housing Academic Facilities Loan program, the Facilities Loan Program, and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities program.</p>
<p>Functionality includes receivable, collection and reporting activities, and financial transaction capabilities. NLS serves as an external subsidiary ledger to the FMSS general ledger for these activities. An electronic interface exists between NLS and the FMSS that provides for the transfer of general ledger level data from NLS to the FMSS on a daily basis. <br />Travel Management System (TMS):</p>
<p>The Department's Travel Management System (TMS), E2 Solutions, is a solution provided by Carlson Wagonlit Government Travel that is hosted outside of the Department as part of GSA's government wide eTravel initiative. It provides an end-to-end process including an integrated on-line booking engine, travel authorization, and vouchering process. The system is currently in a steady state lifecycle through November 2013.</p>
<p><br />Current Operating Environment</p>
<p>The Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is responsible for all design, development, testing, installation, operations, and maintenance of EDCAPS. The system is accessed via the Department's network, which is owned, operated, and maintained by Dell. These essential network services will continue to be provided by Dell. The current EDCAPS infrastructure is located in Dell's Plano Texas Data Center and Dell is responsible for its maintenance.<br />The current technical architecture is a multi-tiered and tightly integrated system utilizing clustered IBM pSeries hardware and high-speed archival devices. The IBM AIX systems and Oracle 10g are optimized for user requirements and are aligned with the technology strategy of Oracle and the Department's Enterprise Architecture (EA): Future State Vision and Transition Strategy. In particular, the IBM architecture is being optimized to provide the best value in terms of scalability, reliability, manageability, performance, and cost. <br />System Hardware and Software</p>
<p>The EDCAPS environment and infrastructure supports multiple AIX hardware platforms, including but not limited to this basic system configuration below. <br />Hardware Details<br />&bull; IBM P-Series (p550, p560, p570 and p750) Hardware<br />&bull; IBM 3583 Tape Backup System for Backup<br />&bull; IBM DS4300/DS4500 and DS4800 SAN Storage<br />&bull; Cisco Gigabit Fiber switch for Oracle RAC Interconnects<br />&bull; Cisco Gigabit Copper switch for Public and Backup Networks<br />&bull; Dedicated Backup Network<br />&bull; Dedicate GPFS file system redundant network</p>

<DESC>This is a revision to the RFI of 8 November 2011 to provide new direction for foreign participation in this effort.&nbsp; In order to promote early exchange of information with industry in accordance with FAR Part 15.2, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) issues this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI will be used to compile industry interest and manufacturing capability for potential future Small Form Factor (SFF) Transponder requirements. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS. <br />The Government tentatively anticipates a requirement for the development and production of a SFF transponder capability to support a procurement quantity of up to 500 units. Initial production unit delivery must meet a 1 October 2014 delivery deadline with follow-on deliveries through 2017 of up to 14 units per month. The SFF transponder will meet the existing AIMS 03-1000A with Changes 1, 2 and 3 (ATCRBS/IFF/MARK XIIA Electronic Identification System and Military Implementation of Mode S) baseline requirements. The SFF transponder shall provide identification, altitude, and surveillance reporting in response to challenges from airborne, ground based and surface interrogators. SFF Transponder specific technical requirements include: dimensions of less than 120 cubic inches in size, less than 7 pounds in weight, power consumption of less than 30 watts; cryptographic computer will be an appliqu&eacute; design; provide Mil-Std-1553, RS-232, and RS-485 interfaces, and Discrete Gillham altitude inputs; ARINC 429 and Ethernet interfaces are desired; meet the environmental requirements of Aeronautical Design Standard ADS-71-SP and the Electromagnetic Interference and power requirements of ADS-37 and Mil-Std-704A-F to meet Army Aviation Airworthiness requirements (standards available upon request); FAA TSO-C112 certification desired; DO-178B, level C software compliant; meet DO-260B requirements for Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out Performance to Support Air Traffic Control (ATC) Service.
<p>THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; however, responsible interested parties should submit information to this RFI in which they can identify interest and capability to respond to this potential requirement. Interested parties are requested to provide a complete response to this RFI even if they have responded to previous RFIs for this effort UNLESS their previous response is dated 8 November 2011 or later.&nbsp;Foreign vendors may submit a response to this RFI; however, participation in any procurement resulting from this&nbsp;RFI will require that all prospective vendors have an existing US COMSEC account and technologies/data safeguarding capability.&nbsp;Please ensure that your RFI response contains sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the technical changes that would be required to your existing system in order to meet the included requirement and schedule. Please submit a rough order of magnitude estimate of the Non-Recurring Engineering costs and Production Unit Cost per year that will be required to achieve the included requirement and proposed schedule. Government personnel may/will conduct site visits of any respondent to evaluate design parameters as well as production capability, capacity, and maturity. Respondents submit information at their own risk; submission of a response to this request will not obligate the Government in any manner. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with information submitted with this request. Proprietary or restricted information should be marked as such and will be protected and used only for the purposes of this RFI. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bid or request for proposal. Any procurement action for Small Form Factor Transponder will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The Government may request follow-on communication, including one-on-one meetings and/or site visits, as a result of this RFI. The Government will not reimburse the respondent for any cost associated with participation in these communications, one-on-one meetings, and/or site visits.</p>

<DESC><strong>Updated 11/22/2011</strong><br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to obtain maintenance and operational support services for an estimated 100 U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) application systems and information technology (IT) environments, as well as modernization support and documentation support through fiscal year (FY) 2021 at an estimated cost of $237 million.&nbsp; A previous sources sought notice was posted to <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for this acquisition (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/NRC/OA/DCPM/NRC-10-33-MOM/listing.html</a>), and the results of the Government's analysis of that sources sought notice have been considered in developing the acquisition strategy for this acquisition.<br /><br />This acquisition is a follow-on to the current "Maintenance and Operational Support of NRC Application Systems" contract, for which the incumbent contractor is OAO Corporation, a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation; the incumbent contract number is DR-33-07-358 and related task orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />The potential period of performance for each IDIQ contract is 10 years.<br /><br />This acquisition is intended to be a multiple award, partial small business set-aside acquisition along functional area (FA) lines (FAs 1, 2 and 3 are full and open competition, and&nbsp;FA4&nbsp;is a small business set-aside) that will result in a single award for FA1 and, for FA2, FA3 and FA4,&nbsp;multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity&nbsp;(IDIQ) contracts&nbsp;under which firm-fixed-price, labor-hour or time-and-materials task orders may be negotiated and awarded.<br /><br />Unrestricted Full and Open Competition (F&amp;OC) functional areas in the solicitation will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Centralized Environment Support (FA1) (single award)<br /><br />&nbsp;-&nbsp;Maintenance &amp; Operation (M&amp;O)&nbsp;of&nbsp;Legacy Systems (FA2) (multiple award)<br /><br />&nbsp;- Requirements and Design (FA3) (multiple award)<br /><br />Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA) functional areas in the solicitaiton will include:<br /><br />&nbsp;- Legacy Modernization and New Software Application Development (FA4) (multiple award)<br /><br />The acquisition includes an "on-ramp/off-ramp" feature that provides flexibility in managing the agency's future requirements.&nbsp; NRC anticipates a single solicitation that will utilize&nbsp;a best value tradeoff source selection process for each of the functional areas identified above.&nbsp; This process will result in the award of multiple IDIQ contracts for all functional areas except .&nbsp; The NRC anticipates cost/price and non-cost/price factors to be approximately equal in importance for each&nbsp;FA when evaluating offers and selecting awardee(s) for those functional areas.<br /><br />After multiple IDIQ contracts for FA2, FA3 and FA4 are awarded,&nbsp;individual requirements will be competed among the awardees in those FAs, with the result being a task order award based on that competition.&nbsp; The multiple-award, partial small business set-aside strategy will facilitate competition and maximize opportunities for small businesses over the potential 10-year contract period.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is expected as the legacy systems are retired over the course of this new acquisition, the need for services under the unrestricted full and open competition areas will decrease.&nbsp; In addition, over time, as NRC modernizes its systems, the need for legacy modernizaiton, software application development and maintenance of modernized systems services in the SBSA functional areas will grow.<br /><br />NRC will consider the question of organizational conflicts of interest (OCOI) for this acquisition, in accordance with NRC Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) Subpart 2009.5, and will ensure compliance with OCOI requirements with regard to placement of resulting contract awards.<br /><br />The solicitation and related amendments will only be made available from this web site.&nbsp; Therefore, potential offerors are encouraged to monitor <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> for information or amendments relating to this solicitation.&nbsp; Proposal due date for each FA is&nbsp;specified in Section L of the solicitation, as amended.<br /><br />Effective 11/22/2011, all communications relating to this solicitation or resultant awards, including inquiries, questions and other email submissions from potential offerors, offerors and completed questionnaires for past performance information, shall be submitted ONLY to <a href="mailto:MOMContract@nrc.gov">MOMContract@nrc.gov</a> <br /><br />The response date and time of 1/9/2012 by 12:00 noon Eastern Time that is now included in this notice applies only to FA4.

The proposals were due by&nbsp;July 5, 2011. The&nbsp;Chicago MTESC is part of the Postal Service's network of 15 MTESC sites. The purpose of the Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) network is to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality MTE ready for rapid deployment to Postal facilities and the customers. MTESCs will process the MTEs as specified in the statement of work. The MTESC will receive MTE, examine it, and route it for reuse if serviceable, repair it if defective but repairable, or dispose it off if beyond repairable. (Disposal may be through waste pickup or material recycling and will be directed by the Postal Service.) Each MTESC in the network will be responsible for processing and repairing MTE for use by Postal facilities and commercial mailers. The MTE network will provide an efficient means of continuously improving the management of MTE processing, repair, and distribution functions. Other benefits expected from the MTE network include better MTE performance and life cycle data and improved control over the disposal of condemned MTE. The MTE network will also allow Postal Service Area and Headquarters staff to continuously balance MTE inventories within and among all Postal Service Network both effectively and efficiently.

<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR FILE
<p>Date:   	October 25, 2011</p>
<p>From:		Lacey Gholson, Administrative Officer</p>
<p>Subject:	Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW FAR 6.302-2<br /> <br />To:		Barbara Taylor, Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />1.	AGENCY IDENTIFICATION AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC), Transfusion Services Laboratory (TSL), has a need to approve a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open" requirement in accordance with FAR 6.3, Other Than Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>This urgent and compelling procurement action in accordance with IAW FAR 6.302-2 is based on the need to contract blood and blood products to be used in patient care testing.</p>
<p>2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACQUISITION BEING APPROVED</p>
<p>Approval of a purchase order for National Blood Exchange (NBE)/American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) is needed for the continuation of the provision of blood and blood products for the patient care community.</p>
<p>3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS</p>
<p>Blood is the red fluid consisting of plasma, red and white blood cells and other cells which circulates through the heart, arteries, and veins of vertebrates to provide life.</p>
<p>Blood and blood products are used for patients in the NIH Clinical Center and are oftentimes for the use of ill to critically ill patients.</p>
<p>It is NOT possible to estimate the type(s) or quantities of blood/blood products needed for <br />the patient community due to short turn-around needed on items.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this obligation/purchase order will be $199,000. This needs to be awarded by November 1, 2011 due to the urgency of blood and blood products needed to ensure no disruption in providing transfusion services for the NIH Clinical Center patient care community. The estimated period of performance for blood and blood products delivery is November 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012.</p>
<p>4.	IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>The requirement will be solicited under citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2), 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (2) and FAR 6.302-2: Unusual and compelling urgency</p>
<p>5.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED</p>
<p>The proposed vendor is NBE/AABB of Bethesda, MD.  When insufficient blood/blood products are on the shelf, this clearinghouse seeks availability and arranges for the blood and blood products to come from various approved blood banking facilities all over the U.S. to the NIH CC TSL.  It is then brought into the inventory of the TSL and distributed to the floor to be transfused to the patient(s). This saves TSL staff substantial time and resources to locating suitable sources for blood and blood products.</p>
<p>6.	 A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTIABLE</p>
<p>At this current time, it is not practicable to solicit offers for the blood/blood products described in Item 3 above due to the urgency of the requirement and the short turn-around in time available to acquire needed items for patient care.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2), an Intent to Sole Source and synopsis will not be posted to www.fbo.gov. The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in FAR 6.302-2 (Unusual and Compelling Urgency). Also, this purchase is conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, and the unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable. The Government would be seriously injured in addressing critical patient care if the agency complies with the time periods specified in FAR 5.203.</p>
<p>7.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the proposed cost will be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(ii).</p>
<p><br />8.	DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED</p>
<p>Due to the urgent and compelling requirement and impracticable nature and immediate need for blood and blood products, market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the Government will issue a Sources Sought Notice by January 2012 to see if additional sources exist that meet the unique needs of TSL. If so, then<br />the Government will consider at its discretion conducting a competitive acquisition over the long term if such vendors emerge that can provide blood and blood products meeting the unique needs/turn around time needed by TSL in conducting patient care. <br />If not, then a sole source acquisition (base and option years) will be sought with the proposed vendor to ensure consistent, timely long-term delivery of essential blood and blood products to TSL.</p>
<p><br />9.	OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.302-2 (b) (2), the nature of harm that would be brought to NIH CC TSL is that if NIH does not have this in place, NIH CC patients could expire (die) or have their health severely impacted. Many of these patients are here at the NIH CC on research/testing due to their unique conditions/diseases.</p>
<p><br />10.	ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER/PROGRAM OFFICIAL CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>"I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance and which are included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."</p>
