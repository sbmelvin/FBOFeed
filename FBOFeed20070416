<DESC>Project Objectives
The procedures of the study, including the intervention, will be designed by CDC and HRSA with collaborative input from the contractors.  The objective of this contract is for contractors to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine an intervention to increase retention of HIV+ patients in primary medical care.  Contractors will implement and oversee the trial, assure its quality, and supply CDC and HRSA with relevant outcome data described below. We anticipate that the intervention will increase HIV patient retention at least 30% relative to the rates before the intervention.  If found to be efficacious, the government will be able to disseminate this intervention to HIV primary care clinics throughout the United States.   
 Scope of Work
•	The intervention will be implemented and tested for efficacy at six HIV primary care clinics.  Clinic attendance (from clinic records) is the primary outcome variable.  Three clinics (Panel A clinics) will be randomly selected to implement the intervention immediately after baseline clinic data are tabulated and a cohort of patients enrolled and surveyed at each of the six sites; the other three clinics (Panel B clinics) will delay implementation of the intervention for approximately 12 months and will serve as a control group for evaluating the efficacy of the intervention as delivered by Panel A clinics during the prior year.  The first follow-up tabulation of attendance will occur at each clinic after this 12-month intervention period.  Panel B clinics will then implement the intervention for 12 months (and Panel A clinics will continue implementing the intervention). Follow-up tabulation of attendance will be made at each of the six clinics.
Basic design of the study is shown below

Task 1.3  Feedback and Written Revisions.  CDC will provide a draft protocol.  The contractor shall prepare written comments and revisions to be placed  inside a Microsoft Word formatted  draft protocol and survey questionnaires.  The protocol will be circulated by CDC to the contractors several times during Phase 1.  The protocol will include all the intervention procedures.
Task 1.4  Program Review Panel.  The contractor shall submit a signed copy of the Program Review Panel document (CDC form 0.1113, To be provided in the Solicitation) attesting to the Panel’s review of educational pamphlets, fact sheets and intervention materials.
Task 1.5 OMB Package.  The CDC will provide a draft of the OMB documents.  The contractor shall provide written comments and suggestions (inside a Microsoft Word document) concerning CDC’s OMB packet
Task 1.6   Make Improvements to Attendance Tracking System.  The contractor shall make improvements necessary to their site’s attendance tracking capability.  If site does not have a reliable electronic attendance tracking capability (as determined by CDC), they must purchase new software to permit reliable tracking (into the future) of all patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits.
Task 1.7  Create Attendance Database.  The contractor shall create a clinic-wide database on attendance using clinic records. The database shall track forward in time all clinic patients’ attendance at primary medical care visits, using patient identifiers.  
Task 1.8 Data Manager Training.  The contractor shall participate in a two-day data manager training at CDC, during the first 12 months of project.  This training will supply to the contractors the format and software for medical record abstraction, and clinic attendance data submissions.  Quality control procedures, (e.g., double checking of data values) will be included in the training.
Task 1.9  Local IRB Submission and Approval.  The contractor shall submit the CDC-approved protocol for local-site IRB approval.  Following approval, contractor shall deliver to CDC the IRB approval letter and a copy of the IRB-approved consent form with approval and date indicated. .
Task 1.10  Patient Contact Instruments.  The contractor shall develop instruments that capture Case Manager and Outreach worker documentation of patient contacts. These instruments will produce the data that will document the consistency with which the intervention is delivered across time. The minimum format will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Task 1.8)..
Task 1.11  Quarterly Reports.  Submit quarterly progress reports to CDC. The minimum content of the quarterly reports shall be: project personnel in place (by name) during the quarter; changes in personnel or major duties that occurred during the quarter; data collected and submitted by type and shipment date; number of subjects screened; number of subjects enrolled; number of medical chart abstractions. 

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 1
Based on 2080 hours per year.
Principal Investigator:   416 hours
Study Coordinator:  624 hours
Data Manager/Analyst:  624 hours


2.  PHASE 2—PRE-OMB APPROVAL:  (12 months from date of award through 24 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.  We anticipate that there will be minimal activities in Phase 2 because we will be waiting for OMB approval.  Staffing should reflect the reduced workload.
Task 2.1 Investigators Meetings: The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to refine intervention responsiblities of clinic staff, refine the intervention timeline, plan for the intervention training, and participate in bi-weekly conference calls during the year.
Task 2.2  Study Collaboration and Manual:  The contractor shall continue to work towards  preparing to put study in the field.  Contractor shall prepare sections of the intervention training manual that are to be used by study staff members and providers in his clinic. The manual shall include how clinic patients are being approached and recruited into the measurement cohort; the plans for delivering the intervention and oversight of the intervention; and plans for submitting data. 
Task 2.3  Attendance Database:  The contractor shall make quarterly transmissions to CDC in Atlanta of the clinic-wide database on patient attendance. See Task 1.7 for database requirements.
Task 2.4 Quarterly Reports:  The contractor shall submit quarterly progress reports to CDC.  See task 1.11 for required content.

ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT FOR PHASE 2
Principal Investigator:   416 hours
Study Coordinator:  624 hours
Data Manager/Analyst:  624 hours


3.  PHASE 3—COHORT ENROLLMENT AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATATION  (24 months from date of award through 36 months from date of award).  Unless otherwise specified all activities pertain to both Panel A and B clinics.

After contract award, CDC will determine which clinics will be randomly assigned to implement the intervention immediately (Panel A clinics) and which will delay implementation for approximately one year (Panel B clinics).  Phase 3 therefore is presented in 2 options, and the offerors’ proposal must include both options.  

Option 3A—Panel A clinics will implement the intervention during Phase 3,and should therefore include appropriate staffing.
 Option 3B—Panel B clinics, the control group clinics, will enroll their cohort during phase 3  but will not implement the intervention during phase 3.  Requirements for study-specific case management and peer outreach should not be included. Appropriate staffing is to be included by Panel B clinics.

Task 3.1  Investigators Meeting:  The contractor shall attend a two-day investigators meeting at CDC to finalize intervention procedures, and revise timelines.   The contractor shall continue to participate in bi-weekly conference calls.
Task 3.2  Cohort Enrollment:  Identify and enroll a cohort of at least 250 patients during a 4 to 6-month period from the clinic-wide data base.  This cohort should include sufficient numbers of patients who have attended clinic inconsistently.  Attempts should be made to enroll all new patients during the patient enrollment period. 
Task 3.3   Administer Questionnaires.  These are to be administered  to the minimum of 250 cohort members.
Task 3.4   Medical chart Abstraction .  Contractor shall perform medical chart abstractions of each cohort member, using the methodology given at the Data Manager Training at CDC (Phase 1).  The minimum content for the abstractions shall include CD4+ Tcell counts, HIV viral load, AIDS-defining conditions, and therapeutic regimens.   What is entailed in the Chart Review process?
Task 3.5   Quality Control .  Contractor shall perform quality control procedures of data collection. Quality control procedure will be specified in detail by CDC at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.6   Attendance Data:  The contractor shall tabulate patient clinic attendance before and after the intervention using clinic attendance records.  This shall include attendance data for the clinic-wide population as well as the cohort.  The format for that part of the attendance data to be transmitted to CDC will be specified at the Data Manager Training (Phase 1, Task 1.8).
Task 3.7   Transmitting Data.   Transmit attendance, medical chart data, survey (questionnaire) and patient contact data to the CDC over the secure data network.
Task 3.8  Intervention Training-Panel A.  The contractor’s clinic staff shall participate in a four-hour intervention training at the clinic site (Panel A clinics).  The intervention training is to be conducted by a separately funded training contractor, and will require clinic staff to participate in a series of adult learning activities (e.g., written exercises, role playing). 
Task 3.9  Identify Patients at Risk-Panel A.  Implement a method to identify patients at risk of falling out of medical care (Panel A clinics), using the methods in the finalized study protocol from Phase 1. 
Task 3.10  Begin Referrals-Panel A.  Refer patients at risk of falling out of care to a case manager and peer outreach worker as appropriate (Panel A clinics) within one week of screening for this risk.
Task 3.11   Begin Intervention delivery-Panel A.  Contractors shall begin delivering the intervention (Panel A clinics) according to the intervention content determined at the time the study protocol is finalized in Phase 1.
Task 3.12    Supervise Intervention Delivery-Panel A:  Supervise delivery of the intervention by medical providers, case manager and peer outreach personnel, and address problems or issues that arise (Panel A clinics). Problems and their solution shall be included in the quarterly reports.
Task 3.13   Quarterly Progress Reports.  Submit quarterly progress reports to the CDC.  See task 1.11 for required content.

The intervention will target those at risk of missing scheduled clinic appointments as determined by past clinic attendance records and other information.  The intervention will be given to those enrolled in the cohort as well as to other clinic patients deemed at risk of missing appointments.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting research proposals in the area of Thermal Ground Plane (TGP). Proposed research should investigate innovative uses of 2-phase cooling, as in common heat pipes, where the benefits include very high thermal conduction and extreme reliability in a light-weight, thin, 2-D package that is also engineered to match the thermal expansion of semiconductor substrates.  

Successful TGP approaches will explore modern, nano-structured materials for use as the wick, with the materials properties optimized for this role in the system (high lateral fluid mobility, high vertical thermal conductivity), and are compatible with the fluid and casing materials choices for the TGP.  Fluids and casing materials are also an area of potential innovation, leading to the possibility of insulating TGP substrates, or “flex TGP” substrates capable of being bent and twisted to fit novel applications.  Specifically excluded are approaches which rely entirely on solid conduction because these approaches cannot deliver the very high, thermal conductivity required in this program.  

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-36, entitled “Thermal Ground Plane (TGP),” is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; the submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.  The BAA may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: http://www.grants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/mto (go to “solicitation” area) or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format or following the submission instructions described in the BAA may not be reviewed. 

PROPOSER’S QUESTIONS
A “Proposer’s Questions,” website will be posted for BAA 07-36 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto).  If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-36@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The 92d Contracting Squadron will be soliciting (limited to SBA Regions VIII, IX and X, SBA 7700-07-703600) for a competitive 8(a), Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build (non-complex) construction efforts to support the 92d CES mission at Fairchild AFB, Washington.  This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Base Engineer Requirements (SABER).  
Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction.  Task order limits will be $2,000 to $650,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner.  The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $20M over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.
Work to be performed under the MATOC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects.  The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving. Locations of work will be at Fairchild AFB, WA and other associated sites outside the base proper.  All off base sites are within 80 miles of Fairchild AFB. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns who are expressly certified for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.  

A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive 8(a) with a 45-day response time (offers due 45 days after issuing).  In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) contracts to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for 35% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work.  The solicitation will include a 35% design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these requirements.  The seed project magnitude is $500,000 to $650,000.

The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Fairchild plans to include the following factors and sub-factors: 1) Mission Capability, 2) Proposal risk; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Pricing.  Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 2 sub-factors with be used: a) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project and b) Change and Cost Control Management.  Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance.  The sub-factors within Mission Capability are also considered equal in importance.  Combined, all three factors are significantly more important than cost or price.  Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.  

The three highest rated offers from the source selection will receive basic contract award (up to 3).  The highest rated offer will be awarded the seed project subject to availability of funds.  All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2000 task order for the MATOC orientation seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement. These contracts will be issued as direct awards between the contracting office and the 8(a) Contractor pursuant to the Partnership Agreement dated February 1, 2002, between the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Defense.

The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 24 May 2007 and close on or about 22 August 2007. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor’s responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. 
Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-234 is responsible for the maintenance of the J52-P-408 jet engine and its associated support equipment, which provides primary power for the EA-6B aircraft.  The J52’s 4.5 bearing has been the root cause of three (3) Class A mishaps since November 2001.  In order to minimize the risk of in-flight failure of the 4.5 bearing, PMA-234 procured 20 Filter Debris Analysis (FDA) machines (Part Number B067261) from GASTOPS, Inc. on a sole source basis.  The FDA machines have demonstrated ability to analyze material in the J52 Engine oil filter and detect evidence of impending J52 4.5 bearing failure before the failure becomes catastrophic.  

The Navy now requires x-ray system upgrades, and durability and environmental upgrades to these units to enhance system performance, address legacy parts issues, reduce environmental emissions, and extend the service life of these units for continued support of the EA-6B aircraft fleet.  The Navy also requires technical support and spare parts (i.e., detectors and emitters) to support the legacy configuration units until the upgrades can be completed.  NAVAIR intends to award this requirement on a Firm Fixed Price, commercial sole source basis to GASTOPS, Inc., 4900 Bayou Boulevard, Suite 107, Pensacola, Florida, 32503, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  As the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the FDA machine, GASTOPS is the only known source with the proprietary knowledge, experience, and data to manufacture and install the hardware upgrades needed to enable the Navy to meet mission requirements.  

All other responsible sources may submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform this requirement.  These responses may be submitted via email to candice.anderson@navy.mil or may be faxed to (301) 757-6516, Attn:  Candice Anderson, Code AIR-2.5.1.8.1.7.  Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted.  Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis.  No solicitation documents exist and no further information is available at this time.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, announces its intent to contract for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RT&E) engineering and technical support services for low temperature curing paint systems for use on military aircraft. The scope of this effort is to develop an epoxy or urethane based paint system, consisting of both primer and top coat, that is sprayable and curable at conditions below 55 degrees F and 45& RH, (or more preferably between 40 and 50 degrees F and at relative humidity of 30-40%, while maintaining the performance properties of currently qualified mil-spec primers and topcoats. The developmental efforts are divided into two phases that could be conducted consecutively or in parallel. Phase 1 will be focused on the development of a low temperature-curing topcoat, whereas Phase II emphasis will be on the development of a primer that is sprayable and curable at the specified conditions. Performance characteristics of the system and its individual components will be evaluated in accordance with MIL-PRF-85582 and MIL-PRF-23377 for primers, and MIL-PRF-85285 (Type I or Type III) for top coats. Materials will be evaluated in the laboratory. After satisfactory performance in the lab, aircraft and/or components will be painted and subjected to field testing. A successful field demonstration by NAVAIR will consist of at least two years of operational exposure, and in the case of carrier-deployed assets, two carrier deployments of 6 months or longer. Field test results will be considered satisfactory if no additional or excessive maintenance of corrosion control efforts are associated with the new systems when compared to control aircraft. Regular maintenance and touch-up re-pairs are acceptable.
 This proposed effort will be a Full and Open Competitive.  This notice provides pre-solicitation information to parties who feel they are capable of providing the above mentioned services.  It is the Government’s intent to award a FFP single contract to the offeror who provides the best overall value to the Government.  The anticipated period of performance is 2 years.  It is anticipated that a request for proposals will be available through the NAVAIR solicitation homepage, http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ approximately 2 May 2007.   Phone and fax requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive basis with Wayne E. K. Lehman of Westminster, CO, to continue research efforts on organizational aspects of criminal justice and drug abuse treatment working relationships. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. 

 The purpose of this proposed continuation is to support NIDA’s Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS) program by providing expertise in organizational research and drug abuse treatment research to the NIDA Collaborating Scientist in order to develop an implement research on organizational factors in treating the offender with a substance use disorder, continue research efforts on organizational aspects of criminal justice and drug abuse treatment working relationships.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary materials and equipment, except as otherwise specified herein. This is a continuation of current purchase order 263-MJ503632. This is a one year extension. 


Sole Source Justification
Dr. Lehman is able to provide organization and management theory and practice; treatment of substance use disorders; and research design and analysis of data representing complex systems. Dr. Lehman has served as a peer reviewer for drug abuse treatment grant applications and has received research grants from NIDA to understand how organizations identify drug abusers and establish relationships with drug treatment and other social service providers.  He has studied climate and culture as ingredients of organizational innovation and change.  Dr. Lehman’s past work has involved a variety of sophisticated analytic strategies.  He has designed and implemented complex, multi-system research studies.  Dr. Lehman has more than a dozen peer-reviewed publications on topics of relevance to the tasks specified in the PSC, and he has successfully communicated his research findings to audiences of non-scientists (city administrators who provided the setting for his workplace research).  An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research on treating offenders with substance use disorder and continued research efforts on organizational aspects of criminal justice and drug abuse treatment working relationships.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP DL380 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOC’s operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that HP DL380 Servers are an integral component of EOC’s ESX Virtual Server Infrastructure. The equipment listed above is required to provide additional Host servers for the ESX infrastructure thereby increasing the capacity of the ESX Host Farms and augmenting the existing backup/restoration and disaster recovery infrastructure within the ESOC’s Virtual Server Architecture.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC’s Virtual Server Architecture.<BR><BR>ALL INTEMS AND COMPONENTS MUST BE CONFIGURED INTO THE SERVER PRIOR TO SHIPMENT.

<DESC>Question 1: Can you clarify the Government’s intention of “analysis” to be performed under Task (a) (“Analysis of Government Performance Goals”)?  Is it for a mission level analysis or an analysis of goals vs. technology maturity & affordability? Answer: It is for analysis of goals versus technology maturity and affordability.  Question 2: Can you provide characterization of the non-proprietary information listed in Task (c) so that we can scope the level of effort involved in reviewing and “assessing” the information? Answer: Over the past several months, the Government NGAEA team conducted an internal study of technologies potentially applicable to Next Generation Jammer (NGJ). Due to time limitations, the scope of study was limited in breadth and depth.  The technologies listed below were studied.  It is important to note that the listed technologies  are by no means inclusive of all potential technologies that could be used in future NGJ system concepts.   •	Exciter –	Analog Synthesis –	Direct Digital Synthesis –	Photonic Synthesis •	Beam Forming & Signal Distribution –	Analog Beam Forming –	Digital Beam Forming –	Photonic Beam Forming •	True Time Delay –	Analog  –	Digital –	Photonic •	Power Amplifiers –	SSA –	MPM –	Thermal Management •	Amplifier Linearization –	Pre-distortion –	IMD –	Amplifier Memory •	Filters •	Apertures –	Design challenges –	Contractor designs –	Fragmented aperture •	Radomes The study compiled a large body of information from both open and proprietary sources.  The compiled information was also consolidated into a 300-page PowerPoint presentation for the purpose of dissemination to NGJ and NGAEA decision making personnel.  A significant amount of the information developed in the study involves proprietary information, which the Government cannot disclose without appropriate Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) between source companies and companies requesting the information.  The government will disclose the non-proprietary portions of the study upon request.  Requests for proprietary information must be accompanied by a signed NDA between the requesting company and the source company for the proprietary information.  Beyond identifying the source companies of proprietary information, execution of NDAs shall not require Government involvement.      Question 3: Can you define whether the intention of Task (i) is for full formal proposals or suggestions for proposals for Government consideration?  Answer: Full, formal proposals are not required for Task (i).  Proposals developed under Task (i) will be used by the Government for decision making purposes regarding efforts to be executed under Phases I-III of the EC. At minimum, proposals should contain the following: (1) Objective/purpose statement; (2) Description of the work to be performed; (3) Explanation of the technology/manufacturing readiness levels at the start and finish of the effort; (4) Listing of metrics to be used to measure results; (5) Names of the involved parties (e.g. companies, academia, research institutions); (6) List of deliverables; and (7) Estimated cost and duration. Question 4: What documentation will be provided on the F-35 variants for Task (b)? Answer: Though the outcome is presently unknown, the Government NGAEA team is working to develop a similar level of documentation to that being provided for the EA-18G.  Efforts to develop F-35B/C documentation were only recently initiated, while efforts to develop EA-18G documentation began months ago.  The NGAEA team plans to have F-35B/C documentation available in time to support the FY08 contracted EC efforts.  If that ultimately fails to occur, Phase 0 efforts involving F-35B/C will be eliminated or deferred to a later Phase of the EC.     Question 5: Will the reference documents called out in Paragraph 2 of the NGAEA Performance Goals document be provided? Answer: During the white paper/proposal selection phase of the Phase 0 effort, the Government does not intend to provide these reference documents.  As part of any resulting Phase 0 contracts, the Government will provide, as Government Furnished Information (GFI), those reference documents for which there is a demonstrated need.    Question 6: Have any requirements from other candidate platforms been established? If so, will they be provided? 	a. RCS requirements 	b. Physical requirements (size, weight, etc.) 	c. Electrical requirements from platform Answer: See answer to Question #4   Question 7: Will definitions of Common Timing Protocol and Universal Timing Protocol referenced in Paragraph 3.2.5.4 be provided? Answer: The intent of Paragraph 3.2.5.4 is to identify a need for an NGJ system to interoperate, to the maximum extent possible, with friendly Electronic Warfare and C4ISR systems.  The Common Timing Protocol (CTP) is not presently fully defined.  CTP is intended to replace the Universal Timing Protocol (UTP).  During the white paper/proposal selection phase of the Phase 0 effort, the Government does not intend to provide CTP/UTP information.  As part of any resulting Phase 0 contracts, the Government will provide, as GFI, timing protocol information for which there is a demonstrated need.    Question 8: Does this BAA contemplate the important issue, of mitigation of electronic fratricide? Answer: Yes. While Section 6 of the BAA does not explicitly state “electronic fratricide” as a sub-system or component technology, Sections 3.2.5 through 3.2.5.4 of the NGAEA Performance Goals identify goals for interoperability.

Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order.  After award of the initial contract(s), each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.

Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  
Factor 1 - Experience
Factor 2 - Past Performance 
Factor 3 - Technical Approach
Factor 4 - Management

<DESC>This modification corrects the Set Aside from "total small business" to "N/A".

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Koheras A/S Blokken 84 3460 Birkerod, Denmark for two (2) fiber laser systems.
As the updated light sources for the NIST optical heterodyne measurement system, NIST requires two ultra-stable, single-frequency lasers at 1550 nm with linewidths of less than 10 kHz.  This measurement system is currently used to perform NIST frequency-response calibrations of high-speed optoelectronic photoreceivers from approximately 0 to 55 GHz. The pair of lasers must be configured such that their wavelengths are separated by 300 +/- 50 pm when positioned at the center of their wavelength tuning ranges.  In addition, each laser must have a tuning range of at least 700 pm, which will enable the updated heterodyne system to extend maximum operation up to 110 GHz.  Separate wavelength control via a piezo-tuner is also required to maintain stable closed-loop operation at beat frequencies below 1 GHz. The output of the lasers should each be > 5 mW and linearly polarized to maximize the heterodyne signal.  The lasers should be compact and immune to environmental perturbations.
Based on market research, Koheras A/S is the only source that can fulfill all of the requirements including a critical wavelength tuning range of at least 700 pm, making possible a beat frequency that spans from 0 to greater than 110 GHz.  By contrast, the other lasers can at best produce a beat frequency spanning from 0 to 60 GHz.  
Delivery is required by August 31, 2007.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement.  Respondents must provide sufficient documentation that address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing (e-mail preferred) no later than close of business April 18, 2007. Anticipated award date is April 19, 2007.

2.	
Health Information Service Provider (HSP) -     a role that can be played by different types of entities and organizations that meet criteria for the provision of core health information exchange services and abide by relevant polices and procedures

3.	Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) is a network of networks that will facilitate the accurate, appropriate, timely, and secure exchange of health information that allows information to follow the consumer and supports clinical decision making.


Scope of Work Draft 04/09/07

The purpose of this is to establish a near real-time electronic nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems, e.g., Nationwide Health Information Network, to share data and information to enhance rapid response to, and management of, potentially catastrophic infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies.     The capability is dependent on simultaneous provision of data and information to all levels of public health.     A successful HIE must standardize information storage and messaging formats, address privacy concerns, accurately identify patients, and resolve varying local, state, and federal regulations.     
The factors below address this activity:

1.       Interoperability Standards
Contractors will implement the relevant HHS recognized interoperability standards accepted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in December 2006.     See the Executive Order: Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care in Federal Government Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs at http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060822-2.html and standards at     http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/standards.html 

2.       Minimum Data Set for Biosurveillance.
Contractors will implement and iteratively evaluate the Minimum Data Set (MDS) accepted by the American Health Information Community. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.     Harmonized Use Case for Biosurveillance (Visit, Utilization and Lab Results Data).     2006 [cited 2006 Dec 1]); Available from: http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/usecases 

3.       NHIN Health Information Service Provider 
Contractors will ensure the core services and relevant use case capabilities are enabled by a NHIN HSP.       Core services are services, capabilities, behaviors and functions in the following areas:     
           i.            Data Services
           ii.     Consumer Capabilities
           iii. User and Subject Identity Management
           iv.     Exchange Management Services 

4.       Bi-directional Communications
Contractors will implement bi-directional communication for the dissemination and interactive exchange of information, both horizontally and vertically, between the general public, clinical care entities, public health entities, and incident command entities using a common set of communications standards to support alerting and exchange of contact information between public health and clinical care.     Contractors will build on existing rules and policies for appropriate sharing of patient and institution information that balance information protection and access or propose innovative rules. 


5.       Data Quality Management and Accessibility
Contractors will use an architecture approach to data storage that protects privacy and provides simultaneous access for local, state, and federal agencies.     This architecture will support both national anonymized record level data for routine analysis and provide authorized re-identification during emergency investigations. 

Contractors will provide data quality control and data documentation consistent with public health surveillance analytic practices and procedures to establish and maintain a near real-time electronic nationwide public health situation awareness capability. 
   
6.       Data Evaluation and Assessment to Detect, Characterize and Track a Public Health Threat
Contractors will develop visualization, analysis, and interpretation tools for decision support in the event of a public health threat.     These tools will be shared with federal agencies.

7.   Effectiveness, Costs, and Scalability 
Contractors will provide evidence of effectiveness, costs, and scalability of sub-network configurations for connecting healthcare and public health entities.  


Here is the information from the Q&As on April 16, 2007, most of which were not presented:


Pre-solicitation Questions and Answers about Accelerating Public Health Situational Awareness through Health Information Exchanges


1. Do you envision these awards being made to consortium led by commercial entities (such as system integrators) or directly to regional/state health information exchanges, or both?

CDC is open to making awards to both.  In the case of a consortium, we would want to have insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.  These are development contracts for HIEs.  Regardless of whose name is on the contract document, the public health nature of this requirement is an important factor and guiding principle.

2. Is it allowable for multiple investigators to be awarded one contract as a team?

It is allowable for multiple investigators or organizations to be awarded one contract as a Team.  Again, CDC would want insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.

The CDC would look favorably on Partnering or Teaming arrangements among HIEs in the same region or health authority.  We would encourage this kind of Team approach especially in cases where organizations working together enhances efficiency, or provides for complementary skill sets, complementary accomplishments, or other advantages.


3a. Is the intended recipient of the RFP HIE's or vendors?  In other words:  is the intent of the RFP that this pre-solicitation notice refers to 1) to provide funds to up to 15 Health Information Exchanges (HIEs)   OR  2) to provide funds "to more than one cost reimbursement development type contract" to a commercial vendor to facilitate the establishment of information exchange capabilities in these HIE's?

See answer to 3.b., below.

3b. Are the intended recipients of this procurement HIEs (which we assume include RHIO and HSP) or commercial vendors who would be expected to work with and facilitate information exchange among health service providers?

The RFP is intended to facilitate the Federal Government’s goals in establishing and supporting capabilities for a Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN), and doing so through HIEs.  However, CDC recognizes that there may be reasons for an award to be made to a commercial vendor working with one or more HIEs.  For example, a small or relatively new HIE may not have an approved cost accounting system that would allow them to be awarded a cost type Federal contract.   Again, CDC would want insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.

Again, regardless of whose name is on the contract document, the public health nature of this requirement is an important factor and guiding principle.

Additional guidance:  Definitions and Applicant areas of expertise:  

 Definitions:
Health Information Exchange (HIE) is defined as the mobilization of healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region or community.  
“Health Information Service Provider” (HSP) -  a role that can be played by different types of entities and organizations that meet criteria for the provision of core health information exchange services and abide by relevant polices and procedures

Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) is a “network of networks” to that will facilitate the accurate, appropriate, timely, and secure exchange of health information that allows information to follow the consumer and supports clinical decision making.

Potential offerors must demonstrate proven expertise in the following areas:

•	Participatory health information exchange governance – an open and participatory governance process supporting state, regional or non-geographic health information exchange with involvement from a broad and representative range of health care-related organizations. Governance should include jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional constituencies representing the breadth of health care participants such as multiple, competing provider organizations, consumers, ancillary health care services, safety net providers, payers and public health. Offeror’s must provide full descriptions of the governance process and participation by the variety of different stakeholders and demonstrate the buy-in and trust of its participants.

•	Business operations – business services capabilities and resources available in direct or contracted form that can support the production-level complexities of seven days a week/ 24 hours per day healthcare service provision. Possible services should include data services, consumer capability, user and subject identification management, and exchange management services.   

•	Technical operations – proven expertise in direct or contracted form that can support the technical rigor of reliable, redundant and secure data exchange to include, but not be limited by, the health information exchange services


4. Previous information on the referenced NHIN request for proposals has indicated that respondents should be regional HIE initiatives rather than technology or services vendors, as with the original NHIN contract. Is this solicitation to be directed to such initiatives as well? Or does the CDC expect that respondents will be more traditional services contractors? 

The CDC would like to emphasize the public health nature of this requirement, and the goals in establishing and supporting capabilities for a NHIN through HIEs. 

As previously stated, we are open to arrangements that include commercial vendors and recognize that there can be good reasons for having such arrangements.  Again, CDC would want insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.

5. Does "...will be required to participation in the Nationwide Health Information Network process..." mean that successful respondents to this solicitation must also have received an award under the NHIN request for proposals? Or are these two solicitations linked only in that awardees of both must participate in the NHIN process through meetings, specification development, etc?


Participation in the NHIN process is required; an award under the HHS NHIN RFP is not required.


6. Could a non-HIE organization in collaboration with an emerging HIE be considered an appropriate contract awardee?  The emerging HIE may not have the infrastructure or expertise to manage a federal government contract.  Also, the target organizations (HIEs) are often currently not fully funded or staffed to respond to the planned RFP.

The CDC would like to emphasize the public health nature of this requirement, and the goals in establishing and supporting capabilities for the NHIN through HIEs. 

As previously stated, we are open to arrangements that include commercial vendors and recognize that there can be good reasons for having such arrangements.  Again, CDC would want insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.

7. The Description section of the pre-solicitation notice equates Health Information Exchanges (HIE) and Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIO) and characterizes them as entities, which are jointly referred to as "HIE."  In the pre-solicitation webinar announcement HIE seems to refer to a process and the term Health Information Service Provider (HSP) is introduced.  Can you clarify the apparent different use of the term HIE?

See response in 3.b.  


8. It appears that CDC anticipates multiple awards - is this still the case?  If the intent is to award multiple commercial vendors, how does CDC plan to address the development of multiple approaches and interfaces by vendors?  How does this possibility relate to NHIN?

Yes, CDC anticipates making multiple awards.  No where has CDC stated that the intent is to award multiple commercial vendors.  Participation in the NHIN process is required; an award under the HHS NHIN RFP is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this CDC RFP.

9. Will prospective contractors be expected to identify health service providers with whom they will work to facilitate information exchange capabilities or will CDC identify them?
The HIEs are the focus of the anticipated development contracts.  A commercial vendor must be working with an HIE or set of HIEs in order to propose.  Again, CDC would want insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.

10. What is CDCs expectation regarding the possibility of multiple contractor approaches to AVR requirements under item 6?  Is this requirement a duplication of what is presumably being done in other systems (e.g. Biosense)?  Will CDC provide the type of reports they believe are necessary for "decision support in the event of a public health threat?"

Since the area of AVR for biosurveillance is an evolving and developing area which hasn’t reached full maturity and no particular system is an acknowledged optimal standard, there will likely be overlapping research and development requirements and various component AVR mechanisms to integrate in this effort.  Evidence of collaboration and coordination among activities to advance this area will be looked upon favorably.
  
 11. Please characterize the nature of the intended awardees of this solicitation. 
11a.Will they be independent contracting firms and/or teams of contractors who by virtue of award will be approved to provide services and supplies to HIEs who have received a separate award under the NHIN RFPs? 

No.

11b.Will the awardees be HIEs only? If so will each HIE propose a team of contractors? 

CDC is open to making awards directly to HIEs or to commercial vendors working closely with HIEs.  In the case of a consortium or other arrangement where a contractor is working with one or more HIEs, or where several HIEs are working together, CDC wants to have insight into the kind of relationship the parties have constructed, including seeing copies of Teaming or Partnering Agreements.  These are development contracts for HIEs.  Regardless of whose name is on the contract document, the public health nature of this requirement is an important factor and guiding principle.

12. How would you anticipate that HIE’s will be selecting a supplier from among the awardees of this solicitation?  Is this solicitation intended to provide a pre-approved list of suppliers from which HIE’s may select providers without having to host a competitive bid process?
 
No.  See responses to other questions.  We expect HIEs to be the focus of the awards under this RFP even if they work with commercial vendors.  This is a competitive bid process where the CDC is doing the selecting, and this has nothing to do with providing a list of pre-approved suppliers for HIEs.
  
13. Will HIE’s be the actual entities that provide proposals in response to this anticipated solicitation, selecting contractors to support them by whatever process is normally required of them, based on the type of organization? 

HIEs may provide proposals, or commercial vendors working closely with a given HIE or set of HIEs may provide proposals.  Regardless of who takes the lead in drafting the proposal, the public health nature of this requirement must be addressed.  Keep in mind that the goals are as stated:  establishing and supporting capabilities for a NHIN through HIEs. 

14a. Will this be a full and open competition?

Yes, this is full and open competition

14b.Does the Government perceive any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest from bidders currently participating in the NHIN prototype efforts and/or other identified HHS/ONC efforts.  IF so, 1) will the Government identify all known requirements  that could pose a risk and 2) will offerors be eligible for award if they provide acceptable OCI mitigation plans if a actual or potential OCI exists.

    This is a complicated question and would have to be considered on a case by case basis.  This requirement is related to the HHS NHIN effort but is not directly tied to it.  If this is an issue for a vendor, please contact the Contracting Officer to work this out after a solicitation is issued for this CDC requirement.  

14c. What is the anticipated award timeframe and subsequent contract period of     performance?

 	The RFP for NHIN prototype efforts is a “companion” solicitation and should not be in conflict with this RFP.  The anticipated award timeframe is August 2007 with a five year period of performance.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This justification is for the procurement of Mercury automated test suite on a brand name only basis.  The use of brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured/licensed by another company. As the command and control messaging system for domestic offices and posts worldwide, it is imperative that the SMART system function according to the Department’s requirements.  Sophisticated automated testing tools are essential to this purpose.  The range and scope of testing for a system of the size, complexity and importance of SMART cannot be performed solely with manual testing.  Mercury automated testing tools will provide the ability to run a long series of tests unattended often through the night.  In addition, Mercury automated testing software will simulate large numbers of users simultaneously utilizing the SMART application to determine performance metrics and ensure usability of system prior to deployment. IRM/SMART requires the Mercury automated testing products and services to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253©(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1©, is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>No one vendor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Only the products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government’s existing investment.  The rational follows: 1) A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any given product.  While there are competing products with similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable.  The cost in training, experience and project delay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government. The next factor in consideration is the fact that Mercury has a proven track record on the SMART program.  Mercury was used during an early laboratory test of SMART and successfully tested a simulation of1,500 concurrent users (the estimated pilot population) accessing a prescribed set of solution allowing the Government to make major course corrections in the design and architecture of the SMART System.  The licenses for the original mercury test tools have expired.  New licenses are now needed to ensure the major design and architecture changes to SMART have fixed the performance problems identified in the tests that were conducted previously. The SMART program office received Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) services from the Gartner Company.  Gartner’s independent research is widely recognized as an authoritative source of IT trends and recommendations.  SMART relied on Gartner research and professional expertise in selecting Mercury.  According to Gartner, Mercury dominates the automated testing software market with over 50% market share.  Gartner’s ranks Mercury as the Market leader in terms of ability to execute and completeness of vision.  In addition, Gartner’s onsite IV&V experts have stated that “ the Mercury family is the strongest /broadest in overall capacity.”<BR><BR>A)Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>

2. ISSUANCE DATE:  April  16, 2007
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS:  May 14,   2007
4. POSITION TITLE: Senior Public Information Officer, USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $   79,115.00 - $ 102,848.00  per annum (GS 14 ? equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  September   2007 -   September  2009
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 




A. Basic Function of the position: 

The USAID Mission in Kosovo was established in 1999. Since then, the assistance program has moved from post-conflict humanitarian response to focus on building economic and political systems that afford choices, opportunity, and responsibility to all of Kosovo?s citizens. USAID?s assistance program in Kosovo helps to foster economic reform, democracy, and respect for a multi-ethnic society. Accordingly, the Mission manages a large and growing portfolio of activities in economic policy, enterprise development, energy reform and electric utility management, rule of law, decentralization, civil society development, and conflict mitigation, among others. 

Currently, Kosovo is in the midst of historic change. Seven years of United Nations? administration will end with a resolution on Kosovo?s status in 2007. The terms of the settlement agreement will place heavy demands on Kosovo?s fledgling institutions. As a trusted partner in development, USAID will be called upon to help with many aspects of this transition.

Based in Pristina, the Senior Public Information Officer (S/PIO) will support the Mission?s achievement of its objectives in three main ways: 1) by developing and disseminating information about the Mission?s activities to key audiences in Kosovo, thereby demonstrating the USG?s ongoing commitment through the transitional period; 2) by ensuring high-quality reporting and communication among USAID/Kosovo and various U.S.-based stakeholders to demonstrate the relevance of USG assistance. This will likely include management of frequent visits from high-level government officials to Kosovo; and 3) by supporting the Mission?s strategic planning, design, and reporting efforts to accommodate the many program requirements expected to emerge throughout the transition period and subsequent settlement agreement implementation. 

The S/PIO is a staff member of the Mission?s Program and Project Development Office and reports directly to the USAID/Kosovo Program Officer.

ii.	VIP Visit Coordination: Take primary responsibility for integrating protocol arrangements with    
  	     regular and out-of-the-ordinary USAID activities at the time of the visit, and act as liaison

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/JSC to post a Request for Information via the internet, and solicit responses from industry.	 This request is for information and planning purposes only, and is intended to allow industry the opportunity to raise NASA’s awareness of applicable industry practice, and to lead to more informed competition decisions.   All responses received will be evaluated and considered for inclusion in a resultant action should an action be warranted by NASA.  However, NASA makes no commitment to include any particular recommendation into such an action. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  NASA invites you to submit a response to this RFI to assist in NASA’s efforts to reduce the administrative costs and burden associated with Cost Plus Award Fee contracts.  The objective of this RFI is to request specific comments and suggestions pertaining to the length of the evaluation periods in a service contract.  Responses to the following topic are requested: NASA has traditionally performed award fee evaluations every 6 months, determined a score based on performance, and paid the award fee earned. Informal (not scored) evaluations are typically performed at the mid-term of the 6-month period to allow for timely feedback on contractor performance. NASA is reassessing this practice and looking to lengthen the evaluation interval.  Assuming monthly provisional fee billing will be authorized and written performance feedback given every three months, what impact, if any, would either of the following scenarios have on your business?   1) One 12-month evaluation period per year 2) Two 6-month evaluation periods in the first contract year and 12-month evaluation periods thereafter Additionally, responses must include the following:  name and address of firm; size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; and whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, and/or woman-owned, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  NASA will likely provide Proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.	By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors.   This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA will take procurement action on this matter.  Further, neither NASA, nor the Government, will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  Respondents will not be notified of the results. All responses to this RFI are due by April 24, 2007, to Ms. Susan Stefanovic by e-mail submittal to: susan.l.stefanovic@nasa.gov.  Please reference BT-AFPL-RFI and your company name in any response.   Although not preferred, companies may submit electronic copies of their submittal (CD, DVD) via the mail to: NASA Johnson Space Center, Attn: BT/Susan Stefanovic, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX 77058 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>DEPOT MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTING & PRODUCTION SYSTEM (DMAPS) SUPPORT PURPOSE: Sources Sought for Market Research – A solicitation has not been  issued for this requirement. NAICS CODE:  541611 SIZE STANDARD: $6.5M BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF REQUIREMENT:  The Headquarters Air Force  Materiel Command (AFMC) Logistics Integration Division (HQ AFMC/A4N) at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) has a requirement for IT/systems  engineering, financial management, program control, and functional support  services for the Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System  (DMAPS) and other AFMC/A4 legacy systems as these must be sustained for  subsequent migration to more sophisticated systems that are more  responsive to the needs of all levels of AFMC management and endorsed by  higher headquarters. In October 1996, the Air Force expressed an interest in using the Navy’s  financial management system, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)  Industrial Financial Management System (NIFMS), in their Depot Maintenance  Activity Group (DMAG) facilities. As a result of this expressed interest,  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) agreed to support the  Air Force in conducting a business process review (BPR) to determine the  feasibility of using the NIFMS. The NIFMS is now referred to as the  Defense Industrial Fund Management System (DIFMS). During the BPR, the Air  Force considered the adoption of the DIFMS, NAVAIR Industrial Material  Management System (NIMMS) and Time and Attendance (TAA) as the fundamental  components of the selected DMAPS AFMC Suite.  The entire suite of systems  included the foregoing as well as ABOM and the Integration Engine with all  of it’s’ components.  The final segment of the suite was implemented in  2003 and eliminated several AFMC outdated systems. DMAPS software  modifications in support of AFMC must continue to be supported until the  fielding of the Expeditionary Combat Control System (ECSS), projected to  be the end of Fiscal Year 2012, or by more sophisticated systems.  Failure  to provide this support will cause direct impacts to the Air Logistics  Center’s capability to provide continued organic depot maintenance repair  to the war fighter.  Impacts include delays for transitioning to ECSS,  implementation of AFMC initiatives such as CAM, depot maintenance schedule  slippages and failure in customer’s ability in funding needed repair  activity. REQUEST FOR CABILITY PACKAGE:  Request your firm submit information as to  its capability to perform the tasks set forth in the attached Draft  Performance Work Statement (PWS). DATE DUE:  Packages may be electronically mailed and received in the  buying office not later than Noon (Eastern Standard Time) 13 December  2006.  All questions shall be submitted in writing to Mary White, Contract  Negotiator, with a courtesy copy to Angela Nalley, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center is conducting a market investigation to identify possible sources for burners with applications in current and future military field feeding systems. Burners with an approximate 60k Btu/hr output with high eff iciency, a low power requirement for operation, and a modular design/construction are of interest for application in smaller field feeding systems/appliances. Additionally, burners with a larger output range of 100-300k Btu/hr with high efficiency and a mo dulating firing rate with the capacity to automatically adjust its output to track the variable heating loads demanded by military kitchens are desired for operation within larger military field kitchens.  Overall, burners that operate using JP-8 fuel, con sume little power, are designed for rugged and mobile use, and enhance the opportunity to maximize system efficiency, increase reliability, minimize emissions and enable cogeneration that will help reduce the need for diesel generator support are of intere st.The burners(s) supplied may be subjected to a Government conducted test and evaluation program.  The burner(s) may be subjected to hot and cold storage and operation testing, corrosion testing, combustion by-product emissions testing, exposure to moistu re, transportability testing, and reliability, maintainability, and availability (RAM) testing.  In order to allow for the described testing effort, the burner(s) selected must be in production or at the point in system development where small quantities h ave been produced. The market survey being conducted is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations. No solicitation document exists. Funding is presently not available and not guaranteed. Cost associated w ith the preparation and submission of information and/or any follow-up information requests are the responsibility of the vendor and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond t o this request for information. Responses or questions may be sent via email to doug.brown@natick.army.mil by 04 May 2007.  Please be advised that .zip and .exe files cannot be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 or Virginia.Slayton@us.army.mil   Potential sources sought to participate in a multi-regional standardization of Blood Collection Tubes. A.	General Information:      TRICARE Southeast and Central Regions, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Sout h Carolina, Tennessee, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, and Texas announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ ) for the standardization of Blood Collection Tubes.       The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for Blood Collection Tubes that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardize d product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.       The major facilities in the Southeast area includes: MacDill AFB, FL, Eglin AFB, FL, Keesler AFB, MS, FT Benning, GA, FT Gordon, GA, FT Stewart, GA, FT Jackson, SC, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort, SC, and Naval Hospital Pensa cola, FL.  The major facilities in the Central Region area include: Brooke Army Medical Center, FT Sam Houston TX., Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, FT Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK., William Beaumont Army Medical Center, FT Bliss, TX., 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO., Evans ACH Fort Carson CO., FT General Leonard Wood ACH, MO., FT Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV., and Bayne-Jones ACH, FT Polk, LA.      This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor Program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, (DSCP) Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agree ment (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor(s) for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime V endors to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.        The Southeast Region has been designated as the Lead TRBO for this standardization action.  The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 1 2 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single award is intended in this project; however, the Southeast and Central Regions acknowledge the possibility of more than one award for this agreement. Anticipated award date is September 2007.  The ev aluation will be based on clinical/performance, technical/company, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.        Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required    The Southeast and Central Regions are seeking product lines in the category of Blood Collection Tubes.      The estimated total volume for Blood Collection Tubes is $783,534.63.  This is based on the historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period for both regions.  The individual estimated total volume per region is: Southeast-$256,820.73 and Central-$52 6,713.90.      At the request of the Southeast and Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical us e of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brand, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors D.	   If your are interested in participating in this standardization, you must provide all detailed information on Blood Collection Tubes, which clearly outline the requirements stated within this notice along with a copy of your literature to support all  responses by 4:30 P.M. EDT on the date listed for closing on the FBO announcement.  Vendors that fail to meet the response date and time will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronically responses by email.      Send all corresponding information along with the following: Company name, point of contact, address, phone number, fax, email address, Solicitation Number, Complete answers, and electronic set of literature for Blood Collection Tubes, to Ginny Slayton,  Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil. (706) 787-2019 prior to the closing date of this solicitation in order to remain competitive.          This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical/company criteria, no charge literature samples for clinical/performance evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers based upon single and the potential for  more than one award.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Southeast Region TRBO that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via  email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.   D.  Evaluation Criteria    The Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRB) for all participating regions is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from 12 MTFs in the Southeast and Central Regions.  They are the final dec ision makers for this initiative.   Phase I - Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical criteria/company criteria.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will review the responses and determine acceptability.  After r eview of technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.     Phase II - The Southeast Region TRBO will request the vendors literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected MTFs. Vendors are required to ship literature direct to the MTFs.  Vendors will be given 10 business days from the issue  of the notice to ship literature.  Vendors who do not send Literature by 5:00 P.M. EDT or 4:00 P.M. CDT on the 10th business day will be disqualified from the standardization process.       Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale using a one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has set a 3.0 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than a 3.0 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Phase III - After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.0 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirem ents of the MTFs in the Southeast and Central Regions.  Vendors will also be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on the committed volume of 80% of individual regional requirements in the event of more than one award.   Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing wi ll be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years) for all regions.  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DA PA will be disqualified. a.	Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The CPTs will review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or  services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has a DAPA for Blood Collection Tubes; 4) the quoter has agreements covering the items, with Owens & Minor (Southeast) and with Ca rdinal (Central), the Prime Vendors for the regions; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quote rs information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)  Vendors must respond with the following Phase I technical/company criteria: a.	Vendor(s) must have and provide their DAPA number for Blood Collection Tubes.   b.	Will your company offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified)?  c.	Vendor(s) must have a separate agreement with Owens & Minor for distribution in the Southeast Region.  Must Provide your prime vendor conversion number.  d.	Vendor(s) must have a separate agreement with Cardinal Healthcare for distribution in the Central Region.  Must Provide your prime vendor conversion number.  e.

<SUBJECT>A -- C-Sniper Proposer's Day Announcement
<DESC>C-Sniper Proposers Day
DARPA will host a Collateral Secret Proposer's Day for the C-Sniper program on 3 May 2007 at Executive Conference Center (ECC), 3601 Wilson Blvd., Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22203 (Virginia Square Metro Stop); beginning at 8:30 a.m. and lasting until 5:00 p.m.  The main focus of the C-Sniper Proposer's Day will be to describe the key objectives and provide a technical exchange among potential bidders.  
The objectives of the C-Sniper program are to develop a system and supporting technologies for the detection and neutralization of enemy snipers before they can engage US Forces.  These snipers may be operating in highly cluttered urban environment with both short and long range weapons and optical devices. The C-Sniper system will operate day and night from a moving vehicle and provide the operator with sufficient information to make an engagement decision within an appropriate time of possible detection. Once detection is made, the C-Sniper system will provide the data and control to point and track the on-board weapon system on the selected target. The decision to engage with the target will be left to the operator. During operation, if the system utilizes laser technology then it must be eye safe for all personnel at appropriate ranges depending on aided or unaided operation. DARPA envisions that the completed C-Sniper will be integrated into the Crosshairs system. 

There are many significant technical challenges to overcome to make this into an operational combat system.  These may include as a minimum but not limited to the following: 
1)	Detect enemy snipers carrying weapons before they fire a shot.  Key objective is to determine where the shot may come from rather than where it came from;
2)	Develop techniques to reject clutter and maximize probability of correctly detecting and locating the target; 
3)	Reduce system design complexity minimizing moving parts while maximizing robustness; 
4)	System will be used by soldiers on vehicles in urban and other combat environments.

During the morning session on the Proposer's Day, the Government Team will describe the counter sniper problem and the objectives of the C-Sniper program.  These presentations will end by noon.  In the afternoon session, bidders will be allowed to make 10-minute presentations to all potential partners.  Additionally, 15 minute time slots will be provided by the Government during which organizations that intend to be a prime bidder in response to the C-Sniper BAA can meet one-on-one with the C-Sniper Program Manager (PM).  All discussions will be held at a Collateral Secret level.  Primes can bring a maximum of 5 people to the one-on-one sessions and are encouraged to include their potential / planned subcontractors in their one-on-one meeting.  DARPA is anticipating solicitation of proposals for the C-Sniper effort with a BAA.  The BAA  Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) and the attendance list from the Proposers Day will be available, upon release of the BAA, at: http://www.darpa.mil/sto/solicitations/C-Sniper/index.html. It is not mandatory to attend the Proposer's Day to respond to the BAA with an Abstract (white paper) or proposal.
C-Sniper Proposer's Day Registration Instructions: Participants are requested to register NLT 26 April 2007 at https://www.enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm.  Enter Code: C-S15953.  All participants must send their security clearances to Joanna Chao at Fax#: 703-524-9607 or email social security number to Joanna.Chaomalaguti.ctr@darpa.mil for clearance verification.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ 89554 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-27.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541511. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Lired, 5557 Holmes Run Parkway, Alexandria, VA. 22304. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a Contractor to support specific activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS) through the performance of the tasks listed and described below.  These tasks are divided into four major categories, namely Hardware, Software, Administrative and Collaboration. This Contract calls for contractor support for certain activities in the DCRI Scientific Computing Section (SCS).  A major theme relating to all of these activities is “multidisciplinary research team data mining.” The notion “data mining” as used here is intended to convey the idea of using captured biomedical scientific and administrative data to discover new knowledge, to confirm or refute tentative hypotheses, or to suggest new hypotheses worthy of exploring.  This is in contrast (but complementary to) the more traditional hypothesis driven model which is typically the hallmark of biomedical research. “Multidisciplinary research team,” a concept inspired by the NIH Roadmap, suggests a team approach to data mining. Such teams are comprised of biomedical research scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, administrators, technical writers, intellectual property experts, etc.  In short, whatever skills needed to achieve rapid, high-quality results from data mining efforts would be assembled to work closely together under this multidisciplinary team model. The Scientific Computing Section (SCS) is a component of the NIH Clinical Center that reports directly to the Chief Information Officer of the NIH Clinical Center. SCS promotes the application of advanced computer science methods to the biomedical sciences. This Statement of Work calls for contractor support for a wide variety of SCS activities.  The work described in this Statement of Work will be guided and performed under the auspices of the SCS. There are four major task groups in which work is to be conducted under this Statement of Work.  These task groups are referred to as H=HARDWARE, S=SOFTWARE, A=ADMINISTRATIVE, and C=COLLABORATION.  All four-task groups span over the entire Statement of Work period (approximately one year) and the subtasks specified under each task group are to be worked on asynchronously, i.e. in a time-parallel multi-tasking fashion.  Each of these four major task groups subsumes four subtask classes, which are to be performed in each of four periods where each period runs over an approximate 90 days (quarter year) time span. Thus, the total number of tasks over the entire Contract is sixteen, and the entire Contract will run approximately one year.    An overview of the tasks and the timeline is shown in Figure 1.  The sub-tasks are defined in a general manner below.  It is to be understood that more detailed definitions of these subtasks can only evolve and be made more explicit as work progresses.  It is also to be understood that the Contractor will work closely with the Contract Officer to develop more detailed descriptions of the sub-tasks based on the experience and the knowledge gained as work progresses.

The four major task groups and their associated sub-tasks are as follows: 

    HARDWARE  (H)

CRIS Data Warehouse:  The Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) has been operational in the NIH Clinical Center since August 2004. The CRIS system is a transactional repository system, meaning that it stores data in perpetuity, but it is designed for by-patient access of clinical information. The CRIS Data Warehouse System provides access capability to patient data. The CRIS Data Warehouse hardware task group referred to here calls for the Contractor to consult with other DCRI representatives who are directly responsible for supporting the facilities to access CRIS data.  It will be the Contractor’s responsibility to clearly communicate with these DCRI representatives concerning the CRIS data acquisition needs of the clinical protocol researchers engaged in data mining collaboration projects with the SCS and in working with these representatives, make the necessary data available in a hardware setting in which it may be processed with appropriate application software..

           DLM Data Warehouse:  The NIH Clinical Center Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) uses a server developed in 2004 by SCS to capture, preserve, and run quality control and error reduction software on data emanating from certain laboratory instruments in the DLM environment.  This server serendipitously also serves as a data warehouse.  This DLM Data Warehouse hardware task group calls for on-going maintenance and use of this server as a data warehouse for extracting data used in clinical data mining projects including on-going laboratory instrument quality control and laboratory error reduction projects as well as data visualization projects conducted collaboratively among members of DLM and SCS.

            General Hardware Support:  This hardware task group refers to building, maintaining, and using additional hardware systems for a variety of general support services for SCS and the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG).  Such services include but are not limited to installation and maintenance of data and application servers.

            Web Site Development and Maintenance:  This hardware task group calls for support in all aspects of web site development and maintenance, particularly the NIH Biomedical Computing Interest Group (BCIG) web site.  Such services include but are not limited to all aspects of multi-media presentations, webcasting, podcasting and blogging.


    SOFTWARE (S)

Software Search, Identification and Evaluation:  This software task group calls for continuous monitoring of available software appropriate for use in the SCS.  All resources are to be considered including industry, and open source. Assessing the potential utility of discovered software to fulfill the objectives of the SCS is also called for here. Specific recommendations for in-house software development when called for are also expected within this task group.

            Software Acquisition and Implementation:  This software task group calls for support in the acquisition and implementation of appropriate software that will be used in SCS hosted data mining projects.

            Data Acquisition and Preparation:  This software task group calls for acquiring and preparing data for data mining purposes.  Data will be acquired from multiple sources such as the servers mentioned under “Hardware” above as well as other servers, databases and from spreadsheet files provided by SCS collaborators. 

            Software Design and Development:  This software task group calls for support in the design, development and implementation of system and application software.  It is expected that the Contractor will work closely with the Contract Officer and others in extreme programming fashion to produce this software.

    ADMINISTRATIVE (A)

Strategic Planning: This administrative task group requires the Contractor to assist in the overall administrative, strategic, and operational plans for the SCS.

Communication: This administrative task group calls for advertising the SCS to potential collaborators by planning and announcing services and user focus group sessions arranged according to common computational needs. 
Documentation: This administrative task group calls for documenting all significant work performed under this Contract. 

Publication:  This administrative task group calls for Contractor participation in the preparation of scientific and technical papers relating to both the computer science and biomedical science aspects of work accomplished under this Contract.
. 
  COLLABORATION (C) 

Collaborator Recruitment:  This collaboration task group calls for the Contractor to actively engage in recruiting collaborators to participate in the SCS data mining collaborations.

Domain Understanding:  This collaboration task group calls for the contractor to study and understand the nature of the SCS collaborators’ research.

Data Understanding:  This collaboration task group requires the Contractor to understand in detail the scientific nature and meaning of the SCS collaborators’ data.

Training:  This collaboration task group calls for demonstrating and training biomedical researchers using the computational tools promoted by the SCS.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:     The NDS Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter. There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites will include the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  The full “pickle” barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the remote site by a helicopter rated for that load.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane from the 125 Gal. “Pickle” barrels to standard 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity. This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  Offeror must have experience with this type of task due to high risks associated with it.
Fuel Requirement:  Contractor shall fuel all remote sites with propane quantities per schedule in Attachment 1. All sites are to be filled to maximum capacity, given altitude and temperature limitations for each site. Government estimate for fuel amounts should be +/- 10 % for each site, due to the accuracy of the gauges.  Contractor shall be prepared to account for this variation by carrying 10 % more fuel than requirement calls for to handle this contingency.  Vendor shall record actual gallons of propane delivered to each site on the invoice and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.

Notes to clause FAR 52.216-2:
(1)	for any contract price adjustment requests to CLIN 0001A, 0002A (fuel price), the contractor shall request the price adjustment in writing to the Contracting Officer and provide adequate supporting documentation showing current fuel prices (see 3,  fuel cost submittals below)
(2)	Contract price adjustments shall be limited to one adjustment
(3)	Contract price increases shall not be retroactive, unless the request for increase is received within 10 days of the increase in accordance with FAR 52.216-29(c)(1).  However, in the event that the contractor fails to notify the contracting Officer promptly in writing of any decreases in prices, as required by FAR 52.216-2(b) below, then the Government may adjust the price retroactively to reflect the decrease in prices.
(4)	The following is a hypothetical example to demonstrate contract price adjustment in accordance with FAR 52.216-2:
a.	Assume, for the purpose of this example, that fuel costs are $2.00 per gallon at the time of contract award.
b.	Assume that the contractor requests a price adjustment timely and provides documentation that fuel price have risen to $2.40 per gallon, representing an increase of 20%.
c.	Assuming that the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor’s supporting documentation was sufficient and that the proposed adjustment was fir and reasonable, then the Government would perform a price adjustment ant thereafter compensate the contractor at the adjusted rate of $2.40 per gallon.  
d.	However, in accordance with paragraph FAR 52.216-( c)(1), the maximum aggregate increase over the summer would be 100%.  Thus, if before delivery the price were to exceed $4.00 per gallon (which is 100% of $2.00 in this example) then the Contractor would not receive any further price adjustments.
   52.216-2  Economic Price Adjustment—Standard Supplies. 
As prescribed in 16.203-4(a), insert the following clause. The clause may be modified by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in paragraph (c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office. 
ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT—STANDARD SUPPLIES (JAN 1997) 
(a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for _CLIN 0001A, 0002A is not in excess of the Contractor’s applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item.

The term “established price” means a price that— 
(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and 
(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. 
(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor’s established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. 
(c) If the Contractor’s applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor’s written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations: 
(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 100 percent of the original contract unit price. 
(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective— 
(i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor’s written request within 10 days thereafter; or 
(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request. 
(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause. 
(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price. 
(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor’s written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase. 
(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement and Factor 2 – Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a “go/no go” basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a “go” on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.

1.  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the 24HP front diesel  mower in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

“Descriptive literature” means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 – Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

All responsible business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is May 2, 2007 – 2:00PM local time.

The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), a program of the U.S. Department of Commerce Office of the General Counsel, is uniquely tasked with providing technical assistance in the commercial law arena to the governments and private sectors of transitional countries in support of their economic development goals. CLDP's programs are customized to address key issues that are high priorities for both the host government and the firms interested in doing business in that country.  Through these programs, CLDP actively helps to improve the legal and regulatory environment for U.S. businesses working in transitional countries. 

CLDP anticipates awarding a contract or purchase order to a qualified expert to plan and lead technical assistance programming.  Specifically, CLDP seeks a lawyer with detailed working knowledge of WTO agreements/accession and of Intellectual Property Rights law (TRIPS), in addition to experience in regional integration (The Contractor).  Initially, the Contractor would work on CLDP’s Europe and Eurasia programs.  These programs may be conducted in the countries of Eastern Europe, the Balkans, the former Soviet Union, and Central Asia.  In particular, CLDP currently has programs in Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Bosnia and Herzegovina as well a regional program comprised of nine countries in Southeast Europe.  CLDP assistance in Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Bosnia and Herzegovina focuses on pre and post WTO accession commitments.  In the Southeast Europe regional program, CLDP aims to build capacity, cooperation, and coordination in the areas of customs and agriculture.  At a second stage, the Contractor may be called to work on CLDP programs requiring, too, WTO and/or IPR expertise, but conducted in other regions, in particular in Africa.

CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES:  Through the present contract, the Contractor and its employees, hereafter referred to as the Contractor, will assist CLDP in the planning and implementation of technical assistance activities in Europe and Eurasia and other regions as instructed by CLDP’s Chief Counsel or his/her designee.  Specific responsibilities of the Contractor will include, but are not limited to:

a)	Planning, conducting and evaluating commercial law technical assistance work in developing and transitional countries consistent with relevant legal, US Department of Commerce, Department of State, and USAID policies and procedures;

b)	Facilitating and maintaining close and continuous contact with key stakeholders including USG entities such as USAID, Department of State, Department of Commerce, other federal agencies, Embassy staff, and  public and foreign government assistance recipients and private sector assistance providers;

c)	Presenting and defending Department and CLDP positions in formal and informal meetings with key officials;

d)	Providing briefing and support services to CLDP assistance providers and host government officials; 

e)	Assisting in the day-to-day supervision of staff and leadership while planning and executing operations of the organization, including maintaining close review and coordination of program requirements with CLDP’s Chief Counsel/Deputy Chief Counsel and high-level officials both internal and external to the Department;

f)	Identifying and executing all logistical arrangements and documentation necessary to conduct CLDP technical assistance activities in Washington, DC and overseas;

g)	Leading a team of international program specialists and administrative support staff located in Washington, DC, and overseas;

h)	Preparing and monitoring budgets for CLDP assistance activities on which the Contractor is working and assuming responsibility for the financial record-keeping and financial reports necessary to maintain CLDP office-wide budgets, including reconciliation of monthly statements and planning budgets and coordination of financial reports of billing with CLDP’s Administrative Officer;

i)	Drafting reports for CLDP, other USG Agencies and governments to which assistance is being provided on the status and results of CLDP assistance;

j)	Conducting research on the status of the laws and the political, economic and legal environment of the countries in which the Contractor is working;

<CONTACT>Anthony M. Caruvana, Contracting Officer, Phone 321-867-3464, Fax 321-867-1188, Email Anthony.M.Caruvana@nasa.gov
<DESC>This is Amendment Number 2 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for NNK07OT24Q, entitled Update NASA Provided Educational Software to meet Section 508 Compliance Requirements, which was posted on April 2, 2007. You are notified that the following information is provided based on questions received: Question 1:  Can responses be provided solely via email, or are we also required to provide it via mailed copies as well?   Answer 1:  Responses can be provided solely through e-mail.   Question 2:  If response is provided via email, does that negate the need for the number of copies specified on page 25 of the solicitation?   Answer 2:  Yes, your e-mail response will suffice.  However, the number of copies remains as shown on Page 25 if quoters mail or fax their responses. Question 3:  Which of the 3 proposal parts should include our Representations and Certifications?   Answer 3:  Representations and Certifications shall be submitted separately; identify them as Task IV. Question 4:  On page 26 of the solicitation, under c. Pricing, (ii), the vendor is required to provide a GSA Contract No.	What is the purpose of providing this contract number?  Is this work being ultimately contracted/administered through GSA?  What if a vendor does not have a GSA Contract Number?  What if a vendor has multiple GSA contracts? Answer 4:  Quoters are to provide their applicable GSA contract number if they have one.  A GSA Contract number is not mandatory for award of this contract. Question 5:  Who is the vendor who wrote the KLASS software?  Answer 5:  KLASS was written by NASA.  No vendor involved. Question 6:  For task 1, is the software that is to be remediated a Windows application? Or Linux?  Answer 6:  The software was written in primarily C++.  The Teacher software runs on a Linux machine, the Student software is intended to run on a Windows PC.   Primary remediation would most likely occur at the C Language level.  Question 7:  What GUI library was used, e.g. MFC, native Windows API, wxWidgets, GTK? Answer 7:  Primarily FLTK, however, the Student computer development involved the use of C, C++, FLTK, OpenGL, Truespace, and NuGraf.  The Teacher computer development involved the use of 'C' language, Tcl, MCP language, SGOS Modeling Language, Flex/Bison, Lex/Yacc, and TCP/IP stacks.  Primary remediation would most likely occur at the C Language level.  Question 8:  Is the GUI for the student’s PC’s to be remediated exclusively? Or does the teacher’s version need to be remediated?  Answer 8:  Remediation is required for all portions of the software to bring it into compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  Question 9:  What isn’t working and thus needs to be changed? Answer 9:  The software is fully functional and working.  The intent is that after the 508 compliance, that it should still be a fully functional and working package.  The changes made shall not interfere with the functionality and intent of the software.  Question 10:  For task 2, is the install script for the client, or server software? Answer 10:  The install script is for a user installation of the teacher software and GUI, and potentially a separate install script for student software.  Your expert opinion of the installation scripts will be considered.  Question 11:  For task 2, does the client have an installation package – such as InstallShield – preference?  Answer 11:  No.  The installation script should simplify the installation to a series of dialog boxes, such that almost anyone with minimal IT background can install the software. Quoters are reminded that they are to acknowledge all amendments to this solicitation when submitting their quotes.  This can be accomplished by submitting copies of the amendments with their quotes or by providing the Amendment Number and Date on page 2 of the solicitation, Acknowledgement of Amendments. The due date for responses is extended to not later than 2:00 PM EDT, April 30, 2007. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM’s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM’s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM’s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word “mouse” or “mice” in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.  A printout must be produced for the entire retrieval for each search.  Each citation must be reviewed, and when appropriate, manually annotated to indicate a MeSH heading or headings should be deleted, and/or manually annotated.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific “topic” for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new “topics” for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.

For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word “mouse” or “mice” in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific “topic” for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new “topics” for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM’s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM’s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM’s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word “mouse” or “mice” in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.  A printout must be produced for the entire retrieval for each search.  Each citation must be reviewed, and when appropriate, manually annotated to indicate a MeSH heading or headings should be deleted, and/or manually annotated to indicate a specific MeSH heading or headings should be added.  The entire printout of all citations must then be submitted to NLM.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific “topic” for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new “topics” for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.
