An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties are invited to call the WR Air Logistics Center Ombudsman, Mr. Alan Mathis, WRALC/XP, at (478) 926-2183.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS, VERIFY OFFER DUE DATE, OR CLARIFY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS! The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for an Ortec HPGe gamma detector completely self-contained cooler and detector for USAF AGFU system, including &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; cryostat on a RICOR 535 cooler. Installation uses an existing GEM-90-S detector (customer provided) mounted in a special cryostat which allows cool down from any temperature without the need for thermal cycling. Dector system retains all connections to the AGFU acquisition system. Total length of detector capsule and cooler not to exceed 28&rdquo;. Resolution to be 3 keV or better at 1408 keV. The requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Florida is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of an award. This is a Sole Source with Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1. Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling the government&rsquo;s requirement at this time. A comprehensive investigation of portable Stirling Cycle-cooled High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Gamma Detectors is being conducted as part of an effort to improve the reliability of the field samplers. Three manufacturers (PHDs Co., Canberra and Ortec) offer Stirling cycle cooled gamma detectors. They have already purchased a system manufactured by Canberra and PHDs; therefore require the Ortec system to complete the inventory of test articles. The comparison testing that will be performed in conjunction with this acquisition is the only means to ultimately determine which manufacturer system will best fulfill the mission requirements. No solicitation documents exists at this time. The non-manufacturer rule applies to this requirement as the manufacturer for the referenced NAICS code is a large business. This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3829 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334519. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement. Phone calls will not be accepted. Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW), Transformational Satellite Communication System (TSAT) Program Office, Network Integration Group, intends to extend the period of performance of the current TSAT System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract by 12 months via modification to delivery order F04701-04-F-7044; it was awarded as a Time and Material type contract on a General Services Administration (GSA) schedule. The current period of performance will be extended to cover the period from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009.  The modification will be issued to Booz Allen Hamilton Inc, 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean VA 22102. Classification code 22, identified at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, applies. 

The TSAT SE&I functions that are currently on contract span end-to-end systems analysis and simulation, architecture refinement, requirements development and allocation, risk management and vulnerability assessments, interface management, system integration and test planning, as well as operations and sustainment planning. Due to the uncertainty of DoD impacts on the TSAT program, the current SE&I source selection schedule was delayed until the requirements for future SE&I work can be fully aligned to program direction.  This sole source extension is required to ensure there is not an unacceptable lapse in SE&I support.

All responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities (SOC) which will be considered. Responses from qualified small and small disadvantaged small businesses are encouraged. Oral communications are not acceptable. Interested Contractors must submit an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) by 5:00 pm (Pacific) on 7 May 2008 demonstrating SE&I experience and knowledge of TSAT SE&I.  The SOC must include the following information: 1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) Experience; and 4) Ability to satisfy the government's performance and schedule requirements described above.

All responses must conform to 8.5 by 11.0 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  

This notice is for information purposes only; it does not constitute an RFP.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, Health Effects Laboratory Division and the Biostatistics and Epidemiology Branch intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to The Research Foundation of State University of New York (SUNY), Sponsored Projects Services, 402 Crofts Hall, Amherst, NY 14260 to help NIOSH in examining the impact of atypical work hours on cancer incidence in police officers. The results of this collection will allow for a retrospective analysis of two police cohorts in order to compare cancer incidence across categories of shift work. This effort requires the consulting services of research investigators who have access to daily work history information for these cohorts of Buffalo police officers and experience conducting a cancer registry search for participants involved. Researchers at the SUNY have previously collected cancer incidence data on the police officers and have personal information necessary to conduct a follow-up cancer incidence assessment amount this cohort from 1991-2005 with appropriate maintenance of confidentiality. Additionally, the SUNY is currently collecting daily work history records for the approximately 500 officers participating in the Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) Study. SUNY has been granted access by the City of Buffalo and the Buffalo Police Department to search the records and has obtained the electronic police records from 1994-2005. As a result of this access, they will be able to also identify the officers described in the second cohort above. Based on their experience with this highly specialized type of research, the specified work would be completed in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed-priced order to procure CH-46E Control Display Units, (CDU-7000) on a sole source basis from Rockwell Collins, Inc. of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The CDU system provides cockpit interface for control and display of mission capabilities including Identification Friend or Foe, Navigation Capabilities, and Communications Control.  This is a follow-on effort to the software upgrade from the CDNU-800 to the CDU-7000, which Rockwell Collins is currently working on.  There will be significant cost savings to the Government for the CH-46E helicopter to use the CDU-7000.  The CH-46E can reuse a substantial portion of the CDU-7000 software, which has already been written and tested under the CH-53E program.  The CH-53E helicopter is replacing their CDNU-800 with the CDU-7000 and the commonality of the CDU-7000 between the two helicopter platforms will result in cost savings in spares required, repair resources, reusable software, and publication updates.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The CDU-7000 is a commercial item and was developed at Rockwell Collins' own expense.  As the sole designer, developer, and OEM for the CDU, Rockwell Collins is the only company that has the ability, resources, technology, and documentation necessary to modify, develop, produce, maintain, and support these systems.  The estimated period of performance for this effort is 24 months after the date of contract award.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) in Port Hueneme, CA. continues to develop, improve, and modernize harbor and waterfront facilities to accommodate naval fleets. Daily engineering practice requires knowledge of dynamic couplings between the facilities and their client ships under the influences of winds, waves, currents, passing ships and seismic activities. The facilities in service include solid wharves, pile-supported piers, pontoon-based flotilla, specialized underwater structures, and harbor security assemblies. Client ships vary from large surface ships, dry docks, submarines, lighters, to utility boats. These facilities are normally located in confined shallow waters surrounded by complex bulkheads or land mass. Prior experiences indicate that site specifics often turn the ambient water flows far more complicated than traditional hydrodynamic theories can handle. NFESC is seeking advanced hydrodynamic simulation technologies pertinent to the congested ambience of a real waterfront. Eligible technology for consideration shall precisely address: (a) site specifics, (b) hull shapes, (c) real fluid properties, (d) three dimensional transient flows, (e) arbitrary ship motions, and (f) full aspect of green water over low freeboard. The numerical algorithm shall be sufficiently flexible to facilitate parametric studies over wide range of waterfront configurations and ship layouts. Interested parties should prepare a short abstract describing their technology and prior experiences. The abstract must include the following information.

Abstracts will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. A peer review board will evaluate the abstracts of this BAA. Abstracts that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following criteria (listed in descending order of importance): 1. The merits and pertinence of the proposed technology to waterfront environments, 2. The qualification, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract, 3. The contractors capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. 4.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (Apr 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the fleet.
(b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of the Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).  
(c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance - Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999), will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.  

ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE-NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)
(a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain and operate the Fleet.(b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government. The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier's quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved; suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers who past performance data in the RYG data for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, and discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier's FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.  (d)  RYG classifications are summarized as follows:	(1)  Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.	(2)  Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assuring actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(3)  Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier's price to reflect the Government's estimated additional costs.	(4)  Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.(e)  RYG classifications for all applicable FSC(s) are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NSLC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth NH  03801-3884, telephone number 603-431-9460, ext 464, FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to acquire, on a sole source basis from Canberra Industries, Inc. in Meriden, CT, a Reverse Electrode Germanium Detector, an InSpector 1000, a Falcon 5000, and various accessories and components for the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI).  The items are as follows:

1) Reverse Electrode Germanium Detector
2) Vertical Slimline Dipstick Cryostat
3) Carbon Fiber Detector Window
4) Cryo-Cycle Cooler
5) LabSOCS Characterization of Canberra Detector
6) LabSOCS Efficiency Calibration Software
7) X13660-2 HP 3600N Color Printer
8) On-Site Installation/Familiarization
9) InSpector-1000 Digital Hand Held MCA
10) InSpector-1000 Car Adapter/Charger
11) Hard Case for Inspector
12) ISOCS/LabSOCS Characterization of LaBr
13) Falcon-5000 Portable HPGe System
14) Falcon-5000 Control Computer- Rugged
15) Screw-On Tungsten Collimator
16) Spare Internal Li-Ion Battery
17) 100-240V AC Charger for one Li-Ion Battery
18) Falcon-5000 Control Computer- Tablet

The Reverse Electrode Germanium Detector (REGe) and InSpector 1000 is a multichannel analyzer (MCA).  These units provide the capabilities to evaluate radiological material as well as identify unknown radiological material.  The InSpector 1000 would provide capabilities to detect neutrons as well.  This could enhance identification of radiological substances.  It also allows initial assessment of dose response to estimate wait times and type or radionuclide.

The Falcon 5000 is a portable system that can provide capabilities of initial radiological evaluation.  The unique capabilities of this system would provide dose assessment and identify radionuclides which may be present.

All items to be acquired are compatible with the table top system currently utilized by AFRRI:

Multiple Germanium detectors
Two Lynx MCA systems
Multiple copies of Genie-2000 acquisition control and analysis software
LabSOCS efficiency correction software

Laboratory procedures and training are centered on the above listed Canberra equipment.

The Canberra Germanium detector will be delivered with a liquid nitrogen cooling system where the evaporating nitrogen gas is re-liquefied and forced back into the storage container (dewar). This allows the system to be run almost indefinitely. Canberra is the only vendor with this re-liquefying technology.

The detector will be mathematically characterized for use with existing Canberra Laboratory Sourceless Calibration Software (LabSOCS). This allows AFRRI the ability to analyze samples without having previously purchased a calibration standard in the exact shape and matrix as the unknown sample. This greatly expands AFRRI’s analysis capability in that almost any unknown sample can be analyzed. Canberra is the only vendor which offers this technology.

The detector will be connected to an existing Canberra Lynx multichannel analyzer (MCA) and Genie-2000 software and as such must operate as a system. Canberra is the only vendor who will guarantee complete system performance due to issues of compatibility.

The LabSOCS software (Item 6) will be the second copy purchased by AFRRI. No other vendor offers an equivalent product and this software must be compatible to the one already in use.

The InSpector-1000 (Items 1-12) is a handheld isotope identifier. It is the only unit on the market which offers:
a) LaBr detector technology for increased resolution over NaI detectors.
b) Simultaneous neutron detection capability along with gamma detection.
c) LabSOCS characterization of the LaBr detector.
d) The data file format is identical to the equipment currently in use at AFRRI, namely the Genie-2000 spectroscopy software. This is critical for data and analysis compatibility.

The Falcon-5000 (Items 13-18) is a Germanium detector-based identifier and is the only unit on the market which offers:
a) Canberra’s Genie-2000 software as the user control interface and for analysis. 
b) Up to 8 hours of operation on a single charge of the two internal batteries.
c) “Hot swappable” batteries for continuous operation.
d) Detector cool down time of less than 3 hours. This is critical for quick deployment.
e) The ability to detect gamma rays down to 5 keV. This is important for radionuclide identification of low energy isotopes. Competitive units can detect only as low as 40 keV.
f) Cooling technology which is virtually vibration free which improves the resolution of the spectra. This results in much better Minimum Detectable Activities and also a better opportunity to resolve adjacent peaks and thus different isotopes
g) The Falcon can be fully operated from a remote location. Competitive units require an operator be present at the unit. This may be hazardous when used in a high background radiation environment.
h) Automatic email transmission of data and results after a count.
i) Fully automated and customizable analysis via the imbedded Genie-2000 software. Competitive units restrict analysis to only what is hard coded internally.
j) Removable shielding to reduce background radiation levels and restrict the field of view of the detector to only the sample.

This award is IAW FAR Part 13.106(b) and authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquires may be addressed to Nadine Utz, 4301 Jones Bridge Road, Room A1040C, Bethesda, MD 20814-4799 or nadineutz@usuhs.mil by 30 April 2008 at 12:00 p.m.

3) A U.S. company is considered to be under FOCI whenever a foreign interest has the power, direct or indirect, whether or not exercised, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company's securities, by contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company in a manner which may result in unauthorized access to classified information or may affect adversely the performance of classified contracts.

*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<RESPDATE>123109
<CONTACT>Adam R. Kitay, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-882-6478, Email adam.kitay.ctr@mda.mil
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to defend the US, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack. As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability, modify and improve on existing technologies (commercial and dual-use) for insertion into BMDS Elements, and improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats. To investigate these technologies and technology insertion opportunities, MDA has established a Deputy for Engineering, Producibility and Manufacturing (DEP) whose mission is to identify technology insertion candidates and open/modular systems applications that enhance producibility, quality and/or reliability, lower cost and/or reduce risk for all BMDS elements. 

The MDA/DEP seeks new and innovative concepts for individual projects improving the producibility, quality and reliability of: (1) Anti-Tamper/Software Protection; (2) Radar Systems – Antennas, Transmit/Receive Modules, Signal Processing, Optical Signal Processing, Thermal Management, RF Seekers; (3) Electro-Optical Systems - Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar, Focal Plane Arrays, High Energy Lasers, Beam Control; (4) Propulsion – Booster, Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS) (5) Materials Processing – Composite Structures, Thermal Management Materials, IR Windows; (6) Electronics - Wide Band Gap Materials and Devices, Radiation Hardened/Tolerant Electronics, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Data Links; (7) Power Systems – Batteries, Fuel Cells, Photovoltaic Arrays; (8) Software – application of COTS products to signal processing, middleware, operating systems, simulations and networking; and (9) Manufacturing Processes (supply chain management, obsolescence, and tin-whiskers). 

This solicitation is open to all US and International Business, Universities, and Government organizations.  If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following: (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the proposed technical approach, as well as its rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and potential contribution to the MDA/DEP program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) a description of the offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities. Offerors that have been certified as a Small Business Concern should indicate that status on their submittal. Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows, 2004 or earlier version, or a clearly readable .pdf file, Adobe 7.0 or earler) to the point of contact listed below. White paper submissions should be marked appropriately if they contain proprietary or trade secret information. In addition, please advise the Government of any limitations on the Government’s rights in technical data, which might be provided in connection with the effort described in the white paper. The MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following criteria (weighed equally): (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA/DEP program, to include maturity and level of risk; (2) the ability to develop and demonstrate near-term applications; (3) the offer’s capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost effectiveness (the ROCM). Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement (FAR 35.016). Furthermore, evaluations will be in accordance with DFARS 252.225-7018.

This BAA will remain open until December 31, 2009. Evaluations may take up to six months from receipt of White Paper to complete. 

The Government may use selected support contractor and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement. These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information. Submission of white papers to this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgement and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process. 

Only Government personnel will make a determination on proposals.  In some circumstances, non-government, technical personnel from support contractors will provide advisory and assistance services to MDA, providing technical analysis of white papers and proposals submitted to MDA.

Support Contractor organizations:  Millennium Engineering and Integration (MEI), Advanced Product Transitions (APT), SPARTA, and Dynamics Research Corp. (DRC).

Individual support contractors from these organizations will be authorized access to only those portions of the proposal data and discussions that are necessary to enable them to perform their respective duties. These organizations are expressly prohibited from scoring or ranking of proposals or recommending the selection of a source. In accomplishing their duties related to the source selection process, the aforementioned organizations may require access to proprietary information contained in the offerors' proposals. 

Pursuant to FAR 9.505-4, the MDA contracts with these support contractors include a clause which essentially requires them to (1) protect the offerors’ information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and (2) refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. In addition, MDA requires the employees of those support contractors that provide technical analysis to the DEP program to execute non-disclosure agreements. 

The MDA PMO will conduct an inventory of all proposals received, in each individual topic area, to ensure no conflict of interest issues exist prior to execution of any advisory and assistance services.  If we find that any contractor listed above submits a proposal under an MDA/DEP BAA, we will verify whether the proposal raises any potential conflicts of interest.  MDA anticipates that proposals submitted under a topic area unrelated to the pertinent MDA field activity to which the contractor provides technical support may be allowed if the contracting officer determines that there is no organizational conflict of interest or that any real or apparent conflict of interest is adequately mitigated or avoided.


MDA does not have a specified amount of funding available for BAA awards; however, if MDA does decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing. MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA. Any awards are anticipated to occur in FY 2008 through FY 2010.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award) or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals submitted, or to select only part of an effort described in a proposal for award. The point of contact for concept submittals and questions is Adam R. Kitay, Contract Specialist, at (703) 882-6478 or email at adam.kitay.ctr@mda.mil

The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research. This request for information and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.
PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION: The CLP regularly solicits and awards contracts separately for Organic Sample Analysis and Inorganic Sample Analysis. The program value for organic and inorganic sample analysis is between approximately $10 and $15 million per year. The contracts are Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) IDIQ with a Base Period and multiple 12-month Option Periods. The contracts fall under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541380. The objective of this request for information is to gather information from industry in order to tailor the Government?s approach to acquiring necessary analyses in accordance with customary industry practices.
BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: Full information regarding the CLP, as well as Statements of Work (SOWs), can be found at the following address: http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/. The Organic Program currently operates under the SOM01.2 SOW. SOM01.2 defines methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of trace volatile, low/medium volatile, semivolatile, pesticide, and Aroclor target compounds in water and soil/sediment environmental samples. 
The Inorganic Program currently operates under the ILM05.4 SOW and plans to implement the ISM01.0 SOW in the future. ILM05.4 SOW defines the analytical methods accepted by the CLP for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 23 target analyte metals (including mercury) and cyanide in both water and soil/sediment environmental samples. Analyses are performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA), and colorimetric techniques.
INSTRUCTIONS: Any information submitted by respondents to this request for information is strictly voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted. Interested laboratories are requested to submit answers to the questions below. Laboratories may choose to answer all or some of the questions; all responses will be kept confidential.

<DESC>FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE US DOE IN THE DELIVERY OF WIND ENERGY TO FEDERAL FACILITITES IN ALBUQUERQUE, NM 

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 

Important instructions: Any questions and all responses must be submitted via email. Phone inquiries cannot be accommodated. 

Purpose: Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) to commercial, utility-scale wind farm developers, owners, operators, energy service companies (ESCOs) and financiers who may be interested in forming partnerships with the US DOE in the delivery of wind energy to Federal facilities in Albuquerque, NM. 

This RFI is part of a comprehensive strategy to meet and exceed statutory renewable energy goals for federal agencies; DOE is taking a leadership position in accelerating the development of utility-scale wind projects at DOE sites that have adequate land with wind resources in Class 3-7 regimes and transmission/distribution capacity. This RFI seeks responses to issues identified prior to the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the siting, design, installation, operation and maintenance, and delivery of electrical energy of wind farms at an Albuquerque site. Industry will also have the opportunity to engage in discussions with Sandia prior to this RFI’s response deadline. 

DOE has conducted an initial screening of all DOE facilities and a site at Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque is one of the areas identified as having the greatest wind farm potential by these initial screening criteria. 

DOE seeks to facilitate wind farm development and implementation by installing a meteorological (MET) tower for at least 12 months at the potential wind farm site on available land. Subsequent steps will involve the installation of commercial utility-scale wind turbines at one or more sites. The wind farm(s) may also serve as a blueprint for other federal agencies seeking to meet EPAct’s renewable energy goals and become a showcase to educate the U.S. public on commercial, utility-scale wind technology. 

Background: Recent legislative policy, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), and Executive Order 13423 Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and DOE Order 430.2B Departmental Energy, Renewable Energy, and Transportation Management have provided impetus for DOE to fully assess its own potential to reduce energy consumption and increase the amount of directly-consumed energy from renewable energy resources. The DOE objective is to take a leadership position in meeting the federal renewable energy goals set forth in the EPAct 2005 more quickly than required by law. Double credit will be given for renewable energy produced on agency sites or on Federal lands and used at a Federal facility; or for renewable energy produced on Native American lands. Given the costs of available renewable energy technologies and renewable energy resources on DOE lands, it is anticipated that utility-scale wind energy may provide the most cost effective approach for DOE to meet a significant portion of the EPAct 2005’s renewable energy goal. 

SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES / KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE / DOE AS A WHOLESALE ELECTRIC CUSTOMER 

DOE is primarily interested in on-site renewable projects that will be privately owned and operated, with the DOE site purchasing the energy through a power purchase agreement (PPA). The Department will consider other project arrangements and is seeking input on approaches to structuring agreements. DOE is also in the process of exploring and implementing Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) at most large DOE sites. Energy service companies (ESCOs) have been encouraged to evaluate renewables for the proposed ESPC projects. 

As a wholesale electric customer, it is typical to purchase, schedule, take delivery, and to use the spot market for over- and under-utilization of scheduled deliveries. It is expected that a power block will be competitively purchased of size substantially below the peak demand of the site (72 MW in 2007). An additional summer block is also expected to be procured with additional small power purchases to meet peaking needs through a Merchant Desk. Purchasing strategies involve balancing cost while ensuring power is always available to meet the load and power Purchases are based on forecasts and real-time metering. Excess power can be sold at expected reduced market rates. It is preferred that the wind energy be “firmed” by the developer. However, other options may be considered and an interface may exist in the forecasting function between wind production and load variability. 

It is anticipated that the energy produced by wind turbines will not exceed the consumption of the federal wholesale customers. Thus a nominal installation size of 30 MW of wind turbines is expected without consideration of additional energy customers outside of this transaction. 

Issues of consideration: Sandia seeks to solicit industry input regarding the type of information, data, conditions, resources, contracting mechanisms or parameters, etc. that potential industrial partners would expect/require to be in place in order to respond to a RFP for a wind farm(s) installation and operation on Federal land. The following issues may be addressed or commented on by the developer responding to the RFI, or may be addressed in the future by the Federal entities involved as wholesale customers, or will be deferred until such time as can be addressed in a future RFP. Please address these issues with comments on the requirements, needs, or expectations for a successful wind farm installation. 

• Sandia will install a 50 meter MET tower and a comprehensive wind data set will be made available to all parties interested in the RFP. 
• Sandia will consider requests by interested parties to allow approvals for siting of bidder-supplied MET towers for additional wind assessment. 
• What additional information would a bidder require regarding the wind resource at a particular DOE site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site? 
• Maps of electrical plot plans will be made available at the industry day. (see below) What other information would a bidder need regarding electrical transmission and distribution at the site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site? 
• Interconnect approval will obviously be necessary for any turbines. What other information would a bidder need regarding permission for transmission or distribution systems interconnection? 
• What type(s) of contracting mechanism(s) and terms would a bidder envision in contracting with DOE for wind farms at DOE sites? Potential contracting mechanisms for federal agencies include: 
o Energy Savings Performance Contract 
o Enhanced Use Lease 
o Power Purchase Agreement 
o Power Brokering Agreement (see Attachment) 
o Renewable Energy Credits in exchange for lease and royalty payments 
o Other contracting arrangement of interest? 
• What length of contract would a bidder envision for a viable wind farm project? 
• How would the type of contract affect desired length of contract? 
• What is a reasonable time frame for a bidder to develop and implement a wind farm project? 
• Comment on land use issues and the value to be received for land use in return for the energy to be purchased. 
• Comment on Environmental Assessment (EA), Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requirements and/or processes. 
• Comment on tax incentives and Renewable Energy Credit (RECs) and the ownership structure needed in terms of contracts to maximize benefits of such incentives. 

Issues of land use will include the rules and regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), coordination needed to avoid possible mission conflict due to other activities on the land or nearby, developer’s approach to contracting activities on base such as project management, safety oversight, escorts, QA inspections, etc. Nonetheless, Sandia wants to move forward on wind farm development and interact with industry to pro-actively work through issues to achieve satisfactory resolution in a reasonable time frame. 

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST 

The purpose of this notice is to obtain from potential industry participants: 

1. An indication of the level of interest 
2. Suggestions for inclusion in the RFP to attract potential bidders 
3. Types of development planning and support that would be most useful. 
4. Comments on how best to solicit and form partnerships, and how project costs, roles and responsibilities should be shared to best achieve success (e.g., for site development, construction, infrastructure, commissioning, power purchase agreements, operation, decommissioning, and contract terms). 
5. Comments on the issues of consideration. 

All responses will be held in confidence within the Sandia, Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), and DOE team. Industry recommendations on questions and comments in this RFI will be used to formulate a subsequent solicitation plan, such as an RFP. Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in any future solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving future notification of related activities, if desired. Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals. *** This is not a request for proposals. *** 

Submission of information or an expression of interest does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal to any subsequent solicitation. DOE will use the information to implement its renewable energy effort and incorporate suggestions in future solicitation or other procurement documents where appropriate. 

Respondents wishing to protect specific information and data from unauthorized disclosure should mark such information as "Limited Rights Data," or "Restricted Computer Software," as defined in FAR 52.227-14 - Rights in Data - General. Sandia has found that it cannot assure protection of Supplier data information if it is only marked as "Proprietary". 

Schedule 
It is anticipated that wind farm installation and operation projects would be conducted over a period of 1-3 years. A rough outline of the anticipated schedule is: 

May 7, 2008: RFI posted on Sandia’s Opportunities website at http://supplier.sandia.gov/opportunities/selection.aspx and FedBizOpps at http://fedbizopps.gov. 

June 10, 2008: Industry Day in Albuquerque, NM 
(Location will be announced on the RFI postings on Sandia’s Opportunities website at http://supplier.sandia.gov/opportunities/selection.aspx and FedBizOpps at http://fedbizopps.gov at a later date.) 

July 3, 2008: RFI response deadline 

September 10, 2008: RFI evaluation completed and feedback provided to respondents 

Responses: Responses to this RFI are limited to 10 pages of text information and 10 pages of additional attachments and enclosures. 

Responses must include the following information: 

1. Entity’s legal name and address 
2. Technical contact name and title, phone number, fax number and email address 
3. Respondent's contact name and title, phone number, fax number and email address 
4. Disclose if entity is a small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, non-profit organization, educational institution, or located in a HUBZone. 

Responses to this RFI must be submitted by close of business July 3, 2008 and are to be provided via email to mrcanna@sandia.gov and 2 hard copies via USPS, or other carrier, to Mellie R. Cannady, Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800, MS 0717, Albuquerque, NM 87185-0717. 

Sandia may hold a public meeting to discuss the results of the RFI. All respondents will be notified if a meeting is organized, and information will also be posted on IIPS and FedBizOpps. 

Any future solicitation would be issued by the DOE and posted on the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or FedBizOpps at URL http://fedbizopps.gov.  
Mandatory Requirements There are no applicable mandatory criteria for response to this RFI. However, since it is likely that many of the wind turbines that may result from a future RFP will be sited, operated, and eventually decommissioned on Federal land, it is understood that Federal rules and regulations will be applicable and will also be addressed in a future RFP.

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to assess suitability of specific commercial and governmental space orbit determination and propagation astrodynamic algorithms for the space surveillance catalog maintenance function. The Space and Missile Center is conducting an assessment of specific orbital astrodynamic algorithms in support of the space catalog maintenance function of the Integrated Space Situational Awareness (ISSA) Program.  In particular, the two types of algorithms that will be evaluated are: orbit determination and orbit propagation.  At a minimum these algorithms must meet the following criteria:

(1) Accept inputs for processing radar and optical sensor metric observations.
(2) Calculate an initial satellite orbit and update the state of an existing satellite orbit that complies with a classified secret accuracy requirement.
(3) Propagate a satellite's orbital position into the future (typically 24-72 hours) that complies with a classified secret accuracy requirement
(4) Perform the above calculations equal to or faster than current capabilities.  

For this evaluation, the Government will provide: a) initial satellite positional state, b) observations to perform the orbit determination, and c) specified propagation interval, for a number of test cases.  The contractor will run the cases themselves and provide the results to the Government in a format to be specified.  The Government will hold those results in escrow before providing the "truth data" (reference orbits) back to the contractor for their analysis.

The contractor may then analyze the output to determine the difference between their results and the Government- provided "truth data" (reference orbits), as well as analyze computer speed/performance results.  The contractor may share a copy of these data with the Government in a format to be specified.  

Finally, the contractor must be able to receive and appropriately handle DoD Secret, FOUO, and CUMI data to participate in this assessment. Applicable NAICS Code is 541712 – Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology), Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their Propulsion Units, their Propulsion Units Parts, and their Auxiliary Equipment and Parts (size standard is 1,000 employees). Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged. The primary point of contact is Capt Brian Vesey, Brian.Vesey@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310) 535-2635 and the secondary point of contact is Maj Todd Wiest, Todd.Wiest@losangeles.af.mil, Phone (310) 416-1759

This notification and the opportunity for evaluation of company products/capabilities is not a solicitation for bids or for proposals.  Participation in this evaluation is voluntary and at the expense of the companies that choose to participate. There will be no resulting contract or request for proposals. The Government will use the data to assess capabilities that exist in the market that could possibly meet a Government requirement. If the Government chooses to acquire the above described capability in the future a separate announcement in FedBizOps will be made. 

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from contractors. The ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of data.  Interested parties may call the Ombudsman at SMC, Mr. James Gill.  You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, Per FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government’s intent to award sole source contract to North Country Resources, Inc. This SUBJECT procurement will initiate facilitation, coordination and documentation services regarding the Bighorn Sheep Viability issues facing the Intermountain Region of the Forest Service. Issues to be dealt with include disease transmission between domestic sheep and bighorn sheep, the associated research literature, and how to maintain separation between the two sheep species. Initially the work will center around the appeal decision of the FEIS for the Payette Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and the direction within that decision. The Payette is undergoing an analysis that will supplement the EIS and result in an amendment to the LRMP. Involved in the facilitated discussion are Cooperating State Agencies and Tribal Governments. Included in the discussion will be viability of bighorn sheep populations on the Payette and the effects domestic sheep grazing on the permitted allotments are having to the bighorn sheep. Also included will be discussions regarding strategies to maintain separation of the sheep species given overlap of the permitted allotments and the bighorn sheep habitat. This is not a formal solicitation. This notice constitutes the only notice. The Government encourages all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement to submit, in writing, complete information describing their ability to meet said requirement. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered for the sole purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative written responses are received by April 30, 2008, a sole source contract will be awarded to North Country Resources, Inc. Detailed capabilities may be submitted to the following email address: dbullock@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>The Army Sustainment Command has a requirement to perform a modernization effort for a replacement material for the current M032 1 LB TNT Demolition Blocks.  The current paper container design for the M032 is to be replaced with a plastic container due to the decreasing availability of the current paper material.  Expertise in the production of the M032 1 LB TNT blocks and an active manufacturing line for the item is required to support this effort.  Because this procurement represents less than one day of production, it is considered an uneconomical buy.  This synopsis is to announce the intent of the Army Sustainment Command to award a FFP add-on award to Spectra Technologies, as they are the current producer of the M032 1 LB TNT Block and the only known company capable of performing this effort.  This is a one time effort and all future acquisitions of the M032 1 LB TNT blocks will be competed.

US Army ERDC requires technical expertise for the synthesis and characterization of 14C-carbon nanomaterials for the research program focusing on environmental risk of nanomaterials.  In addition to the synthesis, ERDC also needs additional material science expertise in the characterization of these materials for experimental and descriptive-publication purposes.  The collaboration is described below in two phases.<BR><BR>Phase 1.  14C-single wall carbon nanotubes will be synthesized using established processes that have been developed at RTI.  A total of  gram of tubes with around 100 Ci activity will be synthesized and shipped in a suspension.  As part of the synthesis and clean up, RTI will purify the tubes using an acid-base treatment to remove major metal catalyst contaminants.  Due to the clean up procedures, it is anticipated these tubes will have an aspect of 2 nm by around 100 nm.  As part of the synthesis, RTI will also produce an additional  gram of non-labeled single wall carbon nanotubes.<BR><BR>Phase 2.  Using a recently developed method, single wall carbon nanotubes will be obtained from a process traditionally used for the production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes.  For this process, four main labeled products will be synthesized:  carbon black, fullerenes (C60-C70 mix), single wall carbon nanotubes, and multi wall carbon nanotubes.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code , 541513 is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP)

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for Low-Acid Canned Food (LACF) Data Entry Electronic Support for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN).

1. Objective:

The requirement services will coordinate firm registration and food process filings for low-acid canned food and acidified food as required.  This encompasses the establishment and maintenance of records of all commercial food processors engaged in the manufacture, processing, and/or packing of acidified or thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers to include domestic as well as all foreign firms which export these products to the United States.

2.  Background

Several food spoilage outbreaks with public health significance associated with commercially packed low acid canned foods and acidified foods occurred in the early to mid 1970's.

To provide consumer protection from such incidents, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated three regulations (Attachment 1). Two of these are Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations: 21 CFR Part 113   Thermally Processed Low Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetically Sealed Containers, and 21 CFR Part 114  Acidified Foods.

The third regulation is 21 CFR Part 108 Emergency Permit Control. The Emergency Permit Control regulation sets forth definitions and administrative procedures, and provides the mechanism for enforcement under Section 404 of the Act. It establishes requirements and conditions for exemption from or compliance with Section 404. Specifically, 21 CFR Part 108 requires, among other things, that affected processors, both foreign and domestic, register their firms with FDA and file their scheduled processes using appropriate forms (Refer to Forms FDA:
2541 http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~acrobat/frm2541.pdf 
2541a http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~acrobat/frm2541.pdf
2541c  http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~acrobat/frm2541c.pdf and related instructions). 

By means of these forms, regulated firms register their establishment(s), disclose the low acid canned foods and acidified foods produced in each, and state the technical information for each scheduled process.

From the completed forms (source documents), FDA prepares and maintains a computerized LACF/AF database which contains all the submitted information.   After being transcribed into the database, the source documents are manually filed in the event of litigation and to confirm information in the database.

Registration of a processing establishment is required to be completed only once. When an establishment relocates, registration of the new location is required which nullifies the previous registration. Submission of process data, however, is an on going activity. All changes to process parameters or addition of a new product to a manufacturer's line of products require submission of appropriate process filing forms.

Presently, FDA receives annually approximately 400 new registration forms (FDA 2541) this includes initial registrations and plant relocations. FDA is currently receiving approximately 11,100 process filing forms (FDA 2541a and 2541c) per year.  The information contained on these forms is entered into a computerized data base which can be used by FDA headquarters and field personnel to determine industry compliance with the process filing requirement, selectively evaluate processing parameters, or generate and report classification totals. The hardcopy file is maintained as backup.

3. Scope of Work

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials and services and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to the performance of the work as described below.
work. 

The contractor shall provide staff (contract staff) to be cross-trained in multiple tasks to facilitate quality control and distribution of work.  The contract staff shall coordinate firm registration and food process filings for low-acid canned food and acidified food as required under Federal 21 CFR parts 108.25 and 108.35.  This record encompasses the establishment and maintenance of records of all commercial food processors engaged in the manufacture, processing and or packing of acidified or thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers to include domestic as well as all foreign firms which export these products to the United States. The necessity of this activity is based on the fact that improperly processed canned foods which have a pH greater than 4.6 may support the outgrowth and toxin production of the food borne bacteria Clostridium botulinum which causes the sometimes fatal disease botulism.  The contract staff must apply substantial skill and knowledge of governing agency policies and regulations in the day-to-day dealing with representative of the food industry and representatives of other governments and their agency representatives as well as providing guidance to FDA field offices in matters which pertain to firm registration and process filings.

The contractor shall perform data entry tasks using the Low-Acid Canned Foods (LACF) Web application to help the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) personnel to access, update, and track food process filing compliance with regards to the production of Low-Acid Canned Foods/Acidified Foods (LACF/AF).  The data entered into the LACF Web application by the contractors will provide the FDA personnel with access to the system for viewing registration information and production processes and also will provide easy access to computerized data bases containing information for all previously registered domestic and foreign LACF/AF processors.  The contractors shall in the absence of the Coordinator as requested be responsible for performing work to:

•	Add a Registration Form
•	Update a Registration Form
•	Search for a Registration Form
•	Create a Batch (mail submissions)
•	Add a Process Filing Form to a Batch
•	Assign a Batch to a Food Technologist
•	Update a Batch
•	Track a Process Filing
•	Add/Correct a Process Filing Form(s) in Data Entry Process
•	Update Process Filing Form(s) to Master File
•	Correct Process Filings in Master file
•	Search for Process Filing Form(s)
•	Manage Batches
•	Move Process filings from one FCE to another
•	View an Import Alert
•	Generate Reports
•	Discontinue/replace old forms
•	Attach Support Documentation

The contractor also shall proofread and correct (as necessary) all backlogged and subsequent process filing forms and provide other administrative support services to ensure a timely, accurate and complete LACF/AF database and hardcopy files. The accuracy rate at this point shall be 99.5% error free transactions.  The contractor, at no cost to the Government, will correct contractor errors identified by the Government.

The contractor shall in the absence of the LACF Coordinator, as needed manage the day-to-day activities of the Low-Acid/Acidified Foods Plant Registration/Process Filing System.   These activities include registration of new canning plants as well as the receipt, tracking, and computer data entry/validation and storage of information filed with the Food and Drug Administration on active canning processes submitted by industry. The work includes the establishment and implementation of Quality Control for Registration and Process Filings, checking for accuracy of information being placed in the Tracking file by LACF coordinators and technical editing by editors prior to giving the forms to the contract staff for data entry. 

The Lead will perform Quality Control checks of data entry performed by the contract staff. 

The contract staff shall operate the help desk telephone lines and as requested the LACF e-mail account, which are the primary agency contact points for all registration and filing by industry.  These contacts are used to explain FDA regulatory requirements for firm registration and filing, to assist individual firms in completing their filing forms, and to distribute appropriate forms and accompanying instructions.  In many instances, the contract staff must demonstrate tact and diplomacy in communicating effectively with individuals, including individuals who do not fluently speak English or who have difficulty understanding English. In addition, these contacts often are adversarial as a result of FDA action taken or contemplated for their product.  These contract staff’s tasks include:

•	Assist FDA field offices concerning the compliance status of domestic and foreign acidified and low acid canned food establishments and processes.  They will provide FDA field offices with current information on establishment registrations and process filings on which regulatory decisions are based.  The records maintained by the contract staff determine whether seizure of domestic manufacturer’s products or automatic detentions of foreign manufacturer’s products are warranted.  As requested, they will notify FDA field offices when firms have subsequently met registration filing requirements so that detentions may be lifted.

•	Assist and respond to inquiries from manufacturers, importers, trade associations, foreign embassies, consultants, attorneys, other Government agencies, and private citizens concerning the status of establishment registration and process filings.  They will provide guidance on requirements of 21 CFR 108, for completion of required forms, labeling requirements, and status of foreign firms from which importers may consider making purchases.  The contract staff will independently determine which inquiries should be referred to supervisory or technical experts.

•	Answer questions regarding the new online filing system and as requested, provide the means for industry to access this system to include: address verification, mailing the Primary Authorized Representative letters to the facilities, and notification when access has been granted.  In addition, when Firms have problems logging on the FURLS website with a valid username and password the contractor will refer them to the FURLS help desk for assistance to establish a link with the online system.  As requested the contractor will provide instructions and guidance to firms needing to:

•	Edit registration information
•	View status of filing forms
•	Access current and previously submitted filings
•	Add new filing forms
•	Resubmit returned filing forms

The contractor shall maintain a myriad of detailed accurate computerized data.  The contract staff must be familiar with thermal processing nomenclature and management of a major computerized file to permit accurate classification of documents.  

The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the LACF/AF computer data bases that contain data which is critical to the effectiveness of FDA’s LACF regulatory activities to include domestic and foreign inspections, the surveillance of imported products, heat sterilization process evaluations, and other compliance and regulatory activities.

The contractor shall perform file cleanup projects to remove outdated and erroneous materials from LACF files, including separation and removal of all out of business firms that are now filed in the FDA’s file room, this will require the contract staff to pull outdated folders and send to the records section for further handling. The contractor shall remove duplicate process filings that are in the master file with errors that need to be corrected that would result in inaccurate data being disseminated to the field.  

4.  Customer Service

The contract staff shall operate the help desk. This work requires them to interact with various headquarters personnel (food technologist, compliance officers, and computer programmers), FDA District office personnel (inspectors, investigators, and compliance officers), contract personnel, industry personnel, trade association, and foreign government representatives for the purpose of obtaining or disseminating information on the status of plant registrations/process filings.  This assures that field units have data required to perform their surveillance and regulatory functions.

The contractor shall be responsible for designating batches of forms ready for computer master file update.  The contractor shall not permit a backlog of process forms, due to contractor delays, to exceed two average week's receipts (approximately 400 forms).

The contractor shall as requested, open, date stamp, and sort incoming mail. This shall include retrieving Missing Data file copies of forms returned to firms for clarification and attaching file copies to forms resubmitted by firms.

The contractor shall maintain hardcopy files by manually filing source documents after computer database updates. The contractor will facilitate user access to hardcopy files by physically separating and spreading documents, as cabinets become crowded.  The contractor will keep the LACF file cabinets locked at all times, except when they are working in a particular cabinet.
 
As requested, the contractor shall mail FDA forms and instructions upon receipt of written or telephone requests and will photocopy, mail and file already formulated requests for missing data or clarification.

The contractor shall ensure that employees become familiar with and follow the guidelines provided for in FDA Staff Manual Guide 3140.1, FDA Policy on Use of Government Electronic Equipment and Systems.  

In the event that the contractor fails to meet any one of these requirements, the Government shall notify the contractor by describing the specific deficiency (ies) in writing. The contractor shall correct any described deficiency within five (5) working days after receipt of the above notice at no additional cost to the Government.

Government Space and Equipment Available to the Contractors:

5.  Period of Performance

The period of performance will be June 1, 2008 and ending May 30, 2009, with four (4) one (1) year options.

6.  Hours of Operation

The data entry contract staff shall work forty (40) hours per week, while maintaining at least two (2) employees on duty during normal operating hours of Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  The contract staff shall conform to the norm of CFSAN for monitoring time and attendance and follow the schedule for Federal employees in not working on Federal holidays and any other special closing of the facilities (e.g., Inauguration, closing due to weather, etc.)

The contractor is responsible for making certain that vacation schedules result in a minimum of two team members supporting the office on a regular basis during the normal operating hours.

7.  Security Guidelines

All contractor staff with access to any sensitive FDA information either electronically or on paper must have an FDA Level 5 clearance at no additional cost to the government.  The contractor shall submit in writing any proposed additional staff (name, resume, title, category, hourly rate, and the FDA clearance status) to FDA/CFSAN.  A Level 1 clearance must be requested and submitted within 10 working days if needed.  Proof of clearance must be provided to FDA/CFSAN when received and prior to admittance for work. The information contained in FDA forms 2541a and 2541c is privileged, confidential information and considered by regulations to be trade secrets, therefore, these task must be performed by a contractor who is not engaged or connected with the commercial processing of canned low acid or acidified foods.

8.  Release of Information

Due to the nature of LACF operations, telephone inquiries are routinely made to the desk of the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-618) from industry, state, local, federal, and foreign governments, and academia concerning the status and regulatory compliance of Food Canning Establishment (FCE) registered manufacturers and submitted and technically reviewed FCE Process Filing forms (FDA 2541a and FDA 2541c). These calls are most likely related to importation of related products or FDA and/or state inspections.

As a precaution of security as dictated by 5 U.S.C. § 552, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), some LACF/ACF database information is considered to be trade secret information and must be kept confidential except to the parties who are authorized to receive it. Before releasing any information, if the caller can not be identified as an FDA or other federal employee, through the database, the identity and authority of the caller must be verified. To check to see if a person is authorized in the data base go to the AR screen, if name does not appear, do not give any information other than form. 

At the close of the contract, the contractor shall, after obtaining FDA approval, destroy all information of a confidential or trade secret nature (including), but not limited to, computerized data and computer printouts. Furthermore, after the closeout of the contract, the active files and equipment are to be located in room 3C041.  The inactive files are located in Beltsville, Maryland 20740.

During the course of this contract the Government is preparing to implement a new electronic filing system.  Upon the implementation of this new system, the government will provide training and written procedures for data entry.  Daily operations as referenced in the SOW may also change and the procedures will be documented and provided with training to contract staff.  This type of change does not require a new SOW. If changes are deemed to be a significant change from items identified in this Statement of Work a revised Statement of Work will be provided.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640, UNITED STATES

Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.
 
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number SB134108RQ0250 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541199 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED AND ONLY SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE. 

The NIST Technology Services Division has a requirement for preparation, submission and prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Applications and an Accelerated Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), Preparation, Submission and Prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Application for the following NIST Invention.
     

---BEGINNING OF THE STATEMENT OF WORK---

I. Invention Abstract

The invention deals with the challenge of void-free filling of recessed surface features on non-planar metallized surfaces with iron group magnetic materials. Specifically, the addition of certain benzimidazole derivatives to a conventional additive-free nickel plating baths (e.g. Watts bath) NiS04-NiCli, results in a superconformal deposition growth mode. By superconformal deposition we mean that metal deposition occurs preferentially in recessed surface features, such as patterned trenches and voids, thereby resulting in void-free filling (please see slide in attached Power Point File 2003 (ppt)). By appropriate patterning and design a variety of fully consolidated 3-D shapes and geometries can be fabricated. The resulting structures have potential use as micro-magnets for microelectromechanical devices as well as active magnetic material components for use in a variety of information storage devices. The process may also be useful in the deposition of Ni and related metals as a precursor to forming silicide contacts in microelectronics.


II. Background

In carrying out its responsibilities to promote technology transfer under the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980, as amended by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) of 1986 as amended, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its Office of Technology Partnerships (OTP) often seeks patent protection for inventions developed in its laboratories during the course of scientific and technical activities carried on in support of the NIST mission. The decision to file a non-provisional patent application for a specific invention is made when NIST determines that a patent for the invention will significantly enhance the technology transfer/commercialization attractiveness of the invention to the private, for-profit sector.


III. Scope of Work

The work to be delivered under this SOW by the contractor shall include all necessary supporting research, preparation, submission and prosecution of a non-provisional U.S. patent application for the above referenced NIST invention.


IV. Task 

Task 1 - Conduct all supporting research that, in the professional judgment of the Contractor, is necessary to prepare a non-provisional U. S. patent application. This shall include the following:

a. Review of all technical material submitted by the NIST inventor concerning the invention with the inventor(s).

b. Render an opinion concerning the patentability of the invention.

Task 2 - Prepare the patent application and all necessary supporting documentation in preparation for filing at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  This will be accomplished with final approval on patent application content rendered by the first NIST inventor as named on the application.

Task 3 - File non-provisional patent application with the USPTO. This shall include but not be limited to the following:
	
a. Contractor shall file the patent application with all pertinent ink drawings and diagrams with transmittal papers with the US PTO along with an executed Declaration and Power of Attorney, and shall report the completion of this action to the NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC).

b. Contractor shall request an immediate Publication by the USPTO after the effective date of application submission patent award.

c. Contractor shall request the Information Disclosure Statement when the application is filed.

d. Contractor shall send to the NIST TIC an electronic copy of the invention’s non-provisional patent application as filed with the US PTO immediately after the application’s filing.

Task 4 - Election and preparation of Response to Restriction Requirements

a. Contractor shall provide an Analysis Letter to accompany the Response to First Office Action to include receipt, review, reporting, preparation and filing of response and reporting.

b. Contractor shall provide an Analysis Letter to accompany the Response to Second Office Action and all subsequent office actions to include Final Office Action, to include receipt, review, reporting, preparation and filing of response and reporting.

Task 5 - Electronic Copy of Claims 

Contractor shall provide an Electronic Copy of Claims as added, deleted and/or modified in Response to Office Actions after Response is filed with the USPTO.

Contractor shall provide the filing of Drawings Amended according to the Allowed Claims. 

Contractor shall provide the Response to Notice of Filing Missing Parts of Application.

Contractor shall receipt, review and provide to the NIST TIC Reporting of Notice of Allowability.

Contractor shall review the file wrapper for any outstanding items and resolve any outstanding issues with the USPTO.

Contractor shall conduct a USPTO Examiners interview.  The interviews can be conducted in person or by telephone.


V. Deliverables

The highly variable nature of the patent process and the large, diverse number of necessary interim work products often required to support the preparation, submission and prosecution of a patent application, make it difficult to specify the exact number, type and content or these work products or to prepare a schedule for their production and delivery.

V.3-All supporting drawings and diagrams intended for filing with the Non-Provisional Patent Application or in response to subsequent office actions.

V.4 Appellate documents files after Final Office Action.

V.5 The Contractor’s case file for the entire patent prosecution, to include all attorney correspondence with the USPTO.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Resultant award is subject to the availability of funds.

The solicitation Number is RFP 521-08-005 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-013.  The USAID Haiti Mission requires the services of a highly qualified firm – completely familiar with the country, people and media outlets of Haiti – to conduct a national public relations and media program to assist USAID in highlighting achievements made by the United States Government (USG), through USAID, in technical areas, provincial regions and for the Haitian people on a national scope.  The period of this contract will be two (2) years.  The purpose of the public relations and media program is to achieve four objectives:
•	Make the Haitian people more aware of USAID/Haiti activities and results, particularly those that affect Haitians on a daily basis.
•	Promote USAID/Haiti activities and results to concerned audiences, particularly those in the United States and Haiti, but also including the Haitian Diaspora and other donors in Haiti.
•	Increase local understanding of what USAID/Haiti is and how it works.
•	Strengthen USAID/Haiti’s image with the Haitian government and its citizens.


Description of Services:
To achieve these objectives, it is envisioned that the following outputs would be required:

o	The contractor shall generate and deliver a national public relations and media program to support USAID/Haiti efforts to increase its visibility to the Haitian people by promoting USAID/Haiti activities and results through appropriate media channels, using innovative and interesting publicity mediums that are directed at specific, target audiences.  
o	The contractor shall generate and deliver USAID/Haiti briefing materials, success stories, press information and creative publicity products.  
o	The contractor shall prepare monthly update material for posting to the USAID/Haiti external website and deliver it directly to USAID/Haiti.

Offerors are free to propose alternate outputs, consistent with the strategy proposed.


Background:  
Haiti and the United States enjoy a positive and productive relationship, bolstered by strong historical, cultural, and economic ties. However, despite the generally positive view some Haitians have of the United States, experience has shown that few people, including beneficiaries of USAID programs, really know and/or understand the nature, scope, and extent of U.S. assistance abroad. 

In Haiti, many educated civil and political leaders in general are acquainted with USAID/Haiti's work, but the average Haitian does not know that many of the development programs that have improved their lives on a daily basis are in fact USG programs, managed by USAID.  Consequently, many Haitians do not know how much USAID/Haiti has contributed and is contributing to develop his/her quality of life.  A better understanding of the positive efforts of the American people and government in Haiti will foster improved U.S.-Haitian relations and will support an already positive image of the United States among the Haitian population.

In the U.S., public diplomacy has become a leading foreign policy tool to achieve the goal of improving the image of the United States abroad and showcasing the impact of USG assistance.  USAID/Haiti has consistently taken steps to ensure that Haitians are aware of its development programs and achievements in Haiti.  The Ambassador, Mission Director, Deputy Mission Director, and Senior USAID officials are very involved in USAID/Haiti outreach and communication activities and, to a large extent, leading USAID’s efforts to ensure that the USG’s work in Haiti is constantly communicated to all Haitians.  The Mission undertakes many public relation events already, some of which include launching new projects, celebrating milestone completions with ceremonies and press releases, creating press opportunities nationwide by traveling to the provinces for program implementation and press events, and speaking regularly with concerned partners and parties to communicate joint USG and Government of Haiti (GOH) goals of contributing to Haiti’s social and economic development through USAID/Haiti foreign assistance programs.  

As part of its effort to evaluate successful outreach and communication activities, USAID/Haiti has contracted a U.S.-based polling firm to conduct semi-annual public opinion polls in Haiti from 2007-2010.  As part of these polls, respondents are asked about their opinions on USAID message effectiveness, respondents’ general awareness of USAID as an entity operating in Haiti, and respondent’s general association of USAID activities to improvements in their daily life, among others.  Relevant poll results will be shared with the successful offeror.

C-ARCHITECT-ENGINEER SERVICES SOLICITATION # GS-07P-08-HHD-0050
REGION:  Multiple Zones
CONTRACTING OFFICER: Anthony Kemp
PHONE NUMBER:  817 978-2684
PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.  Multiple awards are expected to be made for each of the primary services areas (zones) as follows:  
Zone 1: California, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Alaska
Zone 2:  New Mexico and Texas
Zone 3:  North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine.
Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. A/E?s may be required to develop prototypical designs, and the Government reserves the right to go back to the architects to modify and site adapt for any and all locations throughout the life of the contract.  All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  All design services will be in accordance with GSA requirements, design guides, and standards.  The design of new and renovation projects at ports of entry is an example of the design programs GSA anticipates ordering under this contract.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design. For systems or infrastructure intensive projects, it may be appropriate for the lead designer to be an engineer.  The Lead Designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design. The A/E firm must address the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and the project team in Stage II.

The Government will use the fixed price amount in the lookup table, which will be a function of project, size, type and complexity. The lookup table will be provided to the A/E during initial contract negotiations and shall be a mandatory payment provision.  In circumstances of more than one award per geographical zone, work orders will be placed based on technically competed proposals. 

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: 

Stage I 
In STAGE I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer. All documentation will be in an 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the RFQ/Solicitation announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 330 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire). Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. The assembled Stage I portfolio is to be no more than one-quarter inch thick. STAGE I submission requirements and evaluation criteria: 

(1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years. The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall indicate the lead designer and address the design approach with salient features for each project.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web
site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

INTRODUCTION

This recommended General Specification was prepared by the National Air Duct Cleaners Association (NADCA).  It describes the minimum requirements necessary to coordinate a successful commercial HVAC system-cleaning project.

This document was created for use by building owners, managers and engineers in the development of cleaning specifications applicable to a certain building or group of buildings.  Therefore, this document must be modified to accurately account for the unique system variations within an individual building.

This specification is written as an owner’s specification, however, substitutions may be made by inserting “mechanical contractor,” “general contractor,” or “architect,” where designated in boldface type.

The use of this specification in and of itself is no guarantee of a successful project.  Sufficient coordination by the owner, including the selection of a qualified contractor, is as equally important as a good specification.

This document was created for projects performed in the United States of America.  For projects outside of the U.S.A., users of this specification are advised to consult applicable laws, standards and regulations of their country to ensure that the contents of this specification do not conflict with such statutes.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

DCHA/OTI’s Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service. The Division supports a majority program-funded workforce in the areas of administrative support, financial management of OTI program funds, human resource assistance for program-funded personnel, information and technology operations and programmatic support for Washington and the field, and procurement tracking of OTI program-funded activities.

DCHA/OTI is an exciting, fast-paced, operational office in USAID. Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.   

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The incumbent serves as an Administrative Operations Assistant reporting to the Operations and Management Team Leader or his/her designee, in the Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) based in Washington, DC. Within DCHA/OTI, s/he has responsibility for daily administrative operations in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field. Approximately 95% of the workload will be in support of program-funded staff and activities in OTI/Washington and the field, and approximately 5% of the workload will also be in support of Direct Hire staff in Washington and the field.

Key functions of the Administrative Operations Assistant are to provide general administrative support to a majority program-funded staff, and provide backup support to the other Administrative Operations Assistants in OTI, the OTI Travel and Transportation Specialist, the OTI HR Specialist, the OTI Personnel Specialist, and the OTI Financial Management Specialist in their absence. The Administrative Operations Assistant may also be required to provide scheduling support for OTI’s 20+ intermittent staff (known as the “bullpen”).  

For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that OTI PSC staff are deployed expeditiously and programs started quickly, often with little or no lead time. This is a key position in a busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt administrative operations support. To achieve this, OTI requires an Administrative Operations Assistant who has the capacity to work well within a team environment and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit.

The selected individual must have strong communication and coordination skills. The incumbent must have a strong sense of responsibility and a high customer service standard. S/He will maintain lists and follow-up on all actions, be highly organized, pay close attention to detail, have good proofreading skills, and be able to handle multi-tasking well. The incumbent must be an individual with sound judgment and excellent interpersonal skills. The Administrative and Personnel Assistant will face situations that require an ability to manage a variety of complex portfolio(s) under extremely short deadlines.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch two new programs in East Africa, one in Kenya, and one in Uganda.  

In Kenya, OTI will initiate a program as part of the U.S. Government’s support of the February 28, 2008 peace accord between competing political parties in the wake of inter-ethnic violence following flawed national elections in December 2007. This program will further the U.S. Government high priority policy objective of helping restore stability in Kenya. The program will support activities mitigating conflict by: (a) defusing national tensions through greater transparency in the political processes following the February accord; (b) supporting community leadership in reducing the likelihood that the January-February violence will be reignited; and (c) providing strategically targeted assistance to national recovery efforts. The program will contribute to the U.S. Government objective of supporting peace and stability in the Greater Horn of Africa.  

In Uganda, OTI will provide impetus to the Peace, Recovery, and Development Program (PRDP) for Northern Uganda by working with local communities, civil society organizations, media outlets, and the Government of Uganda (GoU). The program will be designed in coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities. The first component of the program will be a targeted communications, information, and media infrastructure program in support of the peace process and the GoU’s development plan. The second component will strengthen local governance and improve service delivery to complement and/or lay the groundwork for USAID’s expanded programming in Northern Uganda.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media and peace-building activities.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

In Uganda, OTI will provide impetus to the Peace, Recovery, and Development Program (PRDP) for Northern Uganda by working with local communities, civil society organizations, media outlets, and the Government of Uganda (GoU). The program will be designed in coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities. The first component of the program will be a targeted communications, information, and media infrastructure program in support of the peace process and the GoU’s development plan. The second component will strengthen local governance and improve service delivery to complement and/or lay the groundwork for USAID’s expanded programming in Northern Uganda.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media and peace-building activities.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support OTI programs and the OTI Country Representative.

•	Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;

•	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;

•	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) FSN staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI’s program objectives;

•	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting country representative in his/her absence;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Program Manager to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) regional activities.  The Program Manager will assist one of OTI’s regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participate in new country program assessments as the need arises.  OTI currently has three regional teams: Asia and Near East (ANE), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC).  This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.

NOTE:  At least one candidate may be chosen to begin work on the LAC team.  This candidate selected for initial work on the LAC regional team must meet the Spanish language requirement listed in the Selection Factors in this solicitation.

This position is a laddered position, which begins at the GS-11 equivalent level.  The candidate may be considered for a GS-12 equivalent level after at least one year if s/he receives a recommendation for advancement from the supervisor as part of an excellent performance rating. Advancement to the GS-12 level is not guaranteed.

The objective of this solicitation is to identify and acquire qualified personnel needed to attain OTI regional missions and goals.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

Statement of Work
InfoNet Equipment Installations


1.0 BACKGROUND 

Washington Headquarter Services (WHS) is a Department of Defense (DoD) Field Activity responsible for providing a wide range of administrative and operational services that enable DoD components to accomplish our shared mission of supporting the Secretary of Defense.  In support of this mission, WHS maintains and operates the Pentagon Reservation on behalf of the Director of Administration and Management for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

Washington Headquarter Services Information Technology Management Directorate (WHS/ITMD) provides Information Technology (IT) support for WHS.  Support includes: IT portfolio management, e-business services, and requirements analysis and application development; enterprise architecture development and provisioning;  IT capital investment planning, procurement and asset management; and other technical services, such a information assurance and systems security, help desk and telecommunications services, web development and wireless solutions to meet mission needs.

The InfoNet Center (IMC) supports the revitalization of the communication initiative Pentagon Wide.  The intent is to provide an integrated solution to disseminate and display unclassified, non-sensitive information throughout the Pentagon Reservation, remote locations within the 4th Estate and Department of Defense locations from a centralized WHS location.  This initiative is designed to modernize and streamline the Pentagon’s and Department of Defense’s communications processes as the communications effort continues to develop and expand.   At present, there are a total of 23 InfoNet locations strategically disbursed in hi-traffic areas throughout the Pentagon Reservation. 

This equipment will be assembled and installed by the contractor and configured, tested and placed in production by the on-site InfoNet Hardware/Software Engineer.  If equipment is found to be faulty upon delivery, new equipment replacement will be provided by the equipment vendor at no-cost to the Government.  

2.0 TECHNICAL SUPPORT

2.1 The contractor shall work with the Government to develop a formal problem resolution process that will be incorporated into the BPA.

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.

All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a solicitation for A/E services for a period of one year with four additional one-year option periods.  Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.

Firms are not required to be geographically located in the State where the project is located, and are not required to have an active design production office within the State to be considered for award; however, successful A/E firms will be required to be licensed/registered within the State prior to the award of task order for a specific project and shall conform to all laws, rules, and requirements of that state governing the profession of architecture or engineering.  Multiple awards are expected to be made for each of the primary services areas (zones) as follows:  
Zone 1: California, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Alaska
Zone 2:  New Mexico and Texas
Zone 3:  North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine.
Secondary service areas will include the contiguous United States.
The selected A/E firm shall primarily provide design services, including feasibility studies, bridging documents (35% construction documents), and full design and construction services, and research and reports related to the design of Federal facilities.  The final designs may be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements.  Awardees under this requirement will not be eligible for award (individually or as a team member) on any design build projects resulting from work under any contract awarded under this requirement.

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services may require: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services. New construction may be up to approximately 50% site work and require extensive civil, traffic, environmental, signage and environmental graphics, as well as primarily architectural, landscape architectural, interior design, mechanical, electrical, structural services, and cost estimating, but may also necessitate geotechnical, fire safety, elevator, acoustical, lighting, historic preservation, construction management/inspection, surveyor and other disciplines with specialized experience. The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. A/E?s may be required to develop prototypical designs, and the Government reserves the right to go back to the architects to modify and site adapt for any and all locations throughout the life of the contract.  All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised. Firm-fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts will result from this solicitation, including profit, overhead and hourly rates for anticipated disciplines and for use in negotiating firm-fixed price delivery orders. A supplemental architect-engineer lookup table for pricing delivery orders design services for projects with an estimate construction cost of less than $2 million will be included in the contract.  All design services will be in accordance with GSA requirements, design guides, and standards.  The design of new and renovation projects at ports of entry is an example of the design programs GSA anticipates ordering under this contract.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. The A/E Firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.

PROJECT: New Construction & Repair and Alterations
PROJECT TYPE:   Various
CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security
SIZE: BUDGET: Varied
GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:  
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to plan and design new or expanded Federal facilities as well as repair and alterations of facilities to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design.  Projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for Federal employees.
In this context, The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All new facility designs will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be varied, including renovations, expansions or new facilities.  Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.  Thought should be given to the most appropriate and cost effective construction materials; and design, construction, and delivery methods suitable to the project.  Various project delivery methods, including traditional design and construction, and bridging-design-build, will be used.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch two new programs in East Africa, one in Kenya, and one in Uganda.  

In Kenya, OTI will initiate a program as part of the U.S. Government’s support of the February 28, 2008 peace accord between competing political parties in the wake of inter-ethnic violence following flawed national elections in December 2007. This program will further the U.S. Government high priority policy objective of helping restore stability in Kenya. The program will support activities mitigating conflict by: (a) defusing national tensions through greater transparency in the political processes following the February accord; (b) supporting community leadership in reducing the likelihood that the January-February violence will be reignited; and (c) providing strategically targeted assistance to national recovery efforts. The program will contribute to the U.S. Government objective of supporting peace and stability in the Greater Horn of Africa.  

In Uganda, OTI will provide impetus to the Peace, Recovery, and Development Program (PRDP) for Northern Uganda by working with local communities, civil society organizations, media outlets, and the Government of Uganda (GoU). The program will be designed in coordination with ongoing USAID, State Department, and Department of Defense activities. The first component of the program will be a targeted communications, information, and media infrastructure program in support of the peace process and the GoU’s development plan. The second component will strengthen local governance and improve service delivery to complement and/or lay the groundwork for USAID’s expanded programming in Northern Uganda.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to media and peace-building activities.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The USAID Office of Transition Initiatives Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general and of the sub-region in particular. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including, but not limited to, community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent inter-personal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract/grant oversight is required. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and management of program operations in a conflict environment is preferred. 

The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff performance and morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.

The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Africa Regional Team and will be based in Nairobi, Kenya or Kampala or Gulu, Uganda.

The Country Representative will:

•	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, Government of Kenya or Government of Uganda Officials, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.

•	Serve as OTI’s primary liaison with USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other relevant agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with these varied stakeholders in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;

•	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the USAID Mission and U.S. Embassy and USG personnel, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

•	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, various USG entities, and other donor organizations;

•	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of field-based OTI staff;

•	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

•	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI’s implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) to ensure that activities are contributing to OTI’s program objectives and are within the partner’s scope;

•	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner’s scope to OTI’s country objectives, partner’s budgets, and modifications thereto;

•	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS;

•	Ensure that OTI’s programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

•	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;

•	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;

•	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;

•	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the UN or host government, as appropriate;

•	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the USG personnel in Kenya or Uganda, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate; 

•	If required, travel to other or potential OTI field locations and/or Washington, DC to provide consultations on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties are invited to call the WR Air Logistics Center Ombudsman, Mr. Alan Mathis, WRALC/XP, at (478) 926-2183.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS, VERIFY OFFER DUE DATE, OR CLARIFY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS! The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for an Ortec HPGe gamma detector completely self-contained cooler and detector for USAF AGFU system, including &ldquo;hardened&rdquo; cryostat on a RICOR 535 cooler. Installation uses an existing GEM-90-S detector (customer provided) mounted in a special cryostat which allows cool down from any temperature without the need for thermal cycling. Dector system retains all connections to the AGFU acquisition system. Total length of detector capsule and cooler not to exceed 28&rdquo;. Resolution MUST be 2.5 KeV or better.&nbsp;&nbsp;The requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Florida is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of an award. This is a Sole Source with Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1. Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling the government&rsquo;s requirement at this time. A comprehensive investigation of portable Stirling Cycle-cooled High Purity Germanium (HPGe) Gamma Detectors is being conducted as part of an effort to improve the reliability of the field samplers. Three manufacturers (PHDs Co., Canberra and Ortec) offer Stirling cycle cooled gamma detectors. They have already purchased a system manufactured by Canberra and PHDs; therefore require the Ortec system to complete the inventory of test articles. The comparison testing that will be performed in conjunction with this acquisition is the only means to ultimately determine which manufacturer system will best fulfill the mission requirements. No solicitation documents exists at this time. The non-manufacturer rule applies to this requirement as the manufacturer for the referenced NAICS code is a large business. This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3829 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334519. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. is the only source capable of providing this requirement. Phone calls will not be accepted. Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H. White II, Street MS7200, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, bonnie.pruett@patrick.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a sole-source, firm fixed-price delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00421-06-G-0006 with  Rockwell Collins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa to procure a rehost of the existing Control Display Navigation Unit (CDNU) 800 software onto the Control Display Unit (CDU) 7000.  In addition, this procurement includes testing and common support equipment in support of the CDU 7000.  The CDU system provides cockpit interface for control and display of mission capabilities including Identification Friend Foe, Navigation capabilities, and Communications Control.  As the sole source designer, developer, and OEM for the CDNU, Rockwell Collins is therefore the only company that has the ability, resources, technology, and documentation necessary to modify, develop, produce, maintain, and support these systems.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The estimated period of performance is 12 months beginning after contract award.Numbered Note 22 applies.

March 31, 2008, April 9, 2008 and on April 16, 2008.   This amendment changes the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) issuance date from on or about April 23, 2008 to on or about May 1, 2008, and the response date from April 25, 2008 to May 27, 2008.

Please reference this number when requesting procurement documents, drawings and or questions regarding the solicitation.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public architecture, engineering, and construction through a Design-Build / Bridging delivery method.      

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades – 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades – 13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractor’s personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement, yet must be limited to 2 pages.

<DESC><p>This award announcement is for a fixed price order for maintenance services in support of the Xerox copiers described in Request for Quotation #H94002-08-Q-0012. The Contractor shall provide all maintenance support to include labor and parts, and all consumables, with the exception of paper and staples, for the government owned Xerox copiers under the CLINS and at the location set forth in Request for Quotation H94002-08-Q-0012. (Note: All parts and consumables become the property of the government once they are installed in the copiers.) Maintenance services shall be performed by factory trained technicians, and documentation certifying this training shall be made available to the government. The Contractor shall respond to customer service calls Monday through Friday (with the exception of federal holidays) between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. mountain time. In response to the services calls the Contractor shall provide telephone technical support from a qualified technician within thirty minutes from receipt of the service call. If the malfunction can not be resolved through the support call, a technician shall perform on-site support services within 24 hours from the receipt of the service call unless a portion of the response time falls on a weekend or federal holiday. If this occurs, the response time shall continue into the first business day after the weekend or holiday. And if the copier can not be repaired within 14 business days from the date of the service call, the Contractor shall provide at no additional cost to the government a temporary replacement machine with at least the same capabilities as the government copier until the government owned copier is repaired.
