Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
23.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

ACC-WARREN INTENDS TO AWARD THE CONTRACT TO TELEPHONICS CORPORATION (TELEPHONICS), FARMINGDALE, NY ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: TELEPHONICS IS THE OEM FOR THE MSFV INTERCOM SYSTEM AND CHARGING KIT.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT OWN THE TECHNICAL DATA PACKAGE (TDP) FOR THE INTERCOM SYSTEM OR CHARGING KIT AND THEREFORE IS REQUIRED TO PROCURE THIS REQUIREMENT FROM THE OEM.  PURCHASING A DIFFERENT INTERCOM SYSTEM OR REVERSE ENGINEERING THE TELEPHONICS SYSTEM WOULD CAUSE AN UNACCEPTABLE DELAY AND CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO INCUR A DUPLICATION OF COSTS THAT WOULD NOT BE RECOVERED THROUGH COMPETITION.  ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER OF THIS INTERCOM SYSTEM IS THE ANSF, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAIN A COMMONALITY OF FLEET TO REDUCE LOGISTICS, MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING COSTS.  ACC-WARREN ANTICIPATES MAKING THIS AWARD ON 31 JULY 2013.

<DESC><p>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the procurement of cabling in one NATO building on the grounds of Kandahar Airbase in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government will nominate to the bidders list only those firms that have been approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB).</p>
<p>For performance of the contract, contractor personnel will be required to hold a NATO SECRET personnel security clearance and be required to deploy to ISAF in Afghanistan. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13656-OPL. It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This project is to provide flood wired structured cabling, backbone connections and distribution node for COMKAF HQ. This project will also include a CIS equipment procurement to facilitate the migration to the new building. Contractual options will include flood wired structured cabling, backbone connection and distribution node for the Protected Passenger Handling Facility and providing new equipment and relocation of the JDOC to the new COMKAF HQ.</p>
<p>The cabling will be done on a flood-wiring approach using both fiber optic and CAT6 Shielded Twisted Pair copper cables. Cabling of the COMKAF HQ building is planned for August 2013.</p>
<p>A site survey will be conducted in July 2013.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list potential prime contractors that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 16 May 2013<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued in May 2013</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for June 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award anticipated in July 2013</p>

<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>The past decade has seen an explosive growth in the capabilities of imaging sensors operating in visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Cameras embedded in smart phones are approaching space-bandwidth-products of sixteen (16) megapixels. Recent research programs from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have led to imaging systems that are capable of capturing images with over a billion pixels (Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Imaging Sensor (ARGUS-IS), Advanced Wide FOV Architecture for Image Reconstruction (AWARE)). Mid wave and long wave infrared imaging systems have not achieved comparable performance yet but, spurred by detector array developments under tri-service Vital Infrared Sensor Technology Acceleration (VISTA) program, systems that can capture several hundred megapixel imagery are being attempted, such as Autonomous Real-Time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance Infra Red (ARGUS-IR). Hyperspectral imaging systems were initially developed for imaging earth from satellites and collected images in over 100 spectral bands in order to gather spectral signatures of different materials. Recent developments have reduced the size and weight of these systems such that they are being considered for tactical use on small to medium size unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). It is also known that, upon reflection, the state of polarization from man-made and a natural material is different, which can be used for target detection and identification. Indeed sensor systems have been designed and built to gather information in spatial, temporal, spectral and polarization domains.
<p><br />One consequence of these advances in imaging sensors has been an explosion in data that needs to be stored, processed and disseminated. A single mission can routinely generate multiple terabytes of data thereby severely taxing resources. One way to attack this problem has been to employ powerful on-board processing to compress the data and perform early image processing to identify regions of interest within the wide field of regard.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in a wide area sensor, most of the image data does not contain information of any significance or relevance. For example, wide stretches of sky, ocean or grassy areas do not contain potential targets of interest and hence do not need to be sampled at the same spatio-temporal resolution required for target identification and tracking. Therefore, novel systems have been designed to sample the scene at variable resolution thereby reducing the total data volume. Only those regions that have been determined to contain potential targets of interest are sampled at fine resolution and read out at high frame rates while rest of the areas are monitored at relatively coarse spatio-temporal sampling. However, a similar strategy of space-variant measurements has not been extended to multi-domain sensing involving spectral or polarization measurements. The main objective of this research program is to explore the design and development of sensing systems which make adaptive space variant measurements in multiple domains (space, time, spectrum, polarization).</p>

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is interested in receiving white papers and full proposals for Department of Defense Explosive Ordnance Disposal Applied Research Science and Technology (S&amp;T) projects which offer potential for advancement and improvement of multi-Service EOD operations.
<p>ONR has a need to develop and demonstrate emerging technologies for dismounted missions to detect/locate, access, diagnose/identify, and render safe/neutralize explosive hazards, including Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and unexploded ordnance (UXO) to support the DoD EOD mission.</p>
<p>The EOD mission is to render safe ordnance, including conventional and unconventional, improvised, chemical, biological, and nuclear IEDs and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). It includes land and underwater location, identification, render-safe, and recovery (or disposal) of foreign and domestic ordnance. EOD conducts demolition of hazardous munitions, pyrotechnics, and retrograde explosives using detonation and burning techniques. The EOD mission is unique from the role of other forces, such as combat engineers that support movement of U.S. and allied forces.</p>
<p>An IED is a device placed in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It can include military stores, but normally is devised from non-military components.</p>
<p>White papers and full proposals for exploratory development are sought in the following areas:</p>
<p>a) Rapid Desensitization/Neutralization of Energetic Materials: This effort supports the EOD Explosive Hazardous Device Render Safe/Neutralization mission. It is focused on developing a dismounted (man portable) capability to rapidly de-sensitize loose or exposed energetic material such that it can be moved safely and will not ignite during handling, storage, or transportation. The technology approach should allow for ease of manual use and application, and have a low environmental impact. The neutralization capability weight should not exceed 20 lbs for neutralizing up to 20 lbs. of energetics. Priority materials to be neutralized include insensitive high explosives or insensitive munitions explosive fills.</p>
<p>b) Buried Hazard Removal System: This effort supports the EOD Buried Explosive Hazards Diagnosis and Identification mission. It is focused on dismounted (man-portable) capabilities that can be used to remove or expel a suspected buried threat that cannot be fully diagnosed in situ. The targets may be buried in loose or packed earth at various depths. Targets may weigh as much as 50 lbs with various geometries. Capabilities should be able to be deployed manually or robotically using existing EOD robots. Manual deployments should provide or enable standoff between the operator and target site. Systems using explosives or energetics should use materials currently available in DoD inventories. The capability should weigh less than 10 lbs.</p>

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions. <BR> <BR>(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).    (e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong></p>
<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $1,500,000 to $2,000,000; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. The contract will range in value from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000.</p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Pacific Coastal & Marine Program intends to make a non-competitive award to RBR Ltd, Ottawa, Ontario Canada for the purchase of 18 each RBRvirtuoso DIwave Recorders 0-10m and 4 each RBRvirtuoso DIwave Recorders 0-20m. Recorders are used to collect essential hydrographic information in shallow (<5m) water.  Recorders will be deployed in high-energy environments with waves exceeding 10 feet and need to be the smallest (to deploy it closest to the sea floor as possible).  The DIwave-Wave Recorders are designed to collect rapid data from the pressure sensors, allowing for extremely precise high-frequency measurements necessary to thoroughly document and properly model hydrography in turbulent, high-energy settings.  This is a follow-on to a prior purchase of these instruments and consistency in hardware and on-board processing is crucial for providing accurate comparisons between sites that cannot be done effectively with instruments from different manufacturers.  Additionally USGS has developed processing and visualization computer programs specific to these instruments.  Delivery: 07/29/2013.  The NAICS Code is 334513, Instruments and Related Products.  The Government intends to award this requirement non-competitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the USGS, provided it is submitted by the closing date of this announcement.  As required by FAR 5.101(a)(1), the forthcoming Request for Quote (G13PS00378) will be made available through the GPE on or about May 16, 2013, whether or not competitive opportunities have been identified.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.
Background:  Operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project (CVP) has been implicated as one of the factors responsible for the decline of delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), a species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act.  Entrainment of fish toward the CVP pumping facilities in the southern Delta and operational effects on habitat are two of the principal mechanisms by which the CVP is thought to exert its adverse effects on this imperiled fish species.  There is still an unacceptably high level of uncertainty about the distribution and abundance of larval fish in tidal marsh habitats and whether these habitats provided enhanced numbers of larval fish. If tidal marsh habitats are key rearing habitats for larval fish, than restoration efforts can employed to mitigate for CVP operations. 
The contractor will be required to sort and identify larval fish collected by Reclamation employees as part of larger investigation of fishes in tidal marshes habitats. In particular, the contractor will identify to species, all the larval fish in the samples.  The contractor must be able to visually identify larval (less than 20 mm SL) delta smelt and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) to species and have documentation of this experience. This information is needed for two reasons.  First, the information will be used to guide restoration efforts. Second, this information is needed to comply with FWS ESA permits for the collection of delta smelt (ESA species) and longfin smelt (proposed for ESA listing) from the San Francisco Bay Delta. Ultimately, the information provided by the contractor will allow Reclamation to quantify densities of delta smelt, longfin smelt, and other native fish in the Delta collected from different habitats of the San Francisco Bay Delta.
The contractor shall provide the following main objectives of this task:
Task 1: Sort One Quart Ichthoplankton (larval fish) samples
Sort one quart ichthyoplankton (larval fish) samples preserved in formalin from field collections done by Reclamation biologists from 2013 and 2014.  
Samples with more than 50 % by volume of debris will be subsampled. Samples with debris will be sieved and washed to allow for larval fish to be properly sorted.  Subsampled collections must be properly mixed so that quantification expansion of larvae can be properly determined.  
Task 1 Deliverables: Document time needed to complete samples or any subsampling information.
Task 2. Identify and enumerate ichthyoplankton (larval fish) samples
Larval fish species will be sorted and all species will be identified to the species level, including delta smelt, a ESA listed species
All identified species will enumerated and documented from each sample
Information on sample composition will be provided to Reclamation electronically
Sorted and identified samples will be provided back to Reclamation at the conclusion of the study
Formalin waste will also be sent back to Reclamation for proper disposal
Task 2 Deliverables:
Information on species per sample, number of species per sample, and any subsampling identification time will be provided electronically to Reclamation
This procurement will be awarded using FAR Par 13 Commercial Item procedures with an intended period of performance of a base 12 month period and two 12 month options. Anticipated award date is July 15, 2013.

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

This sources sought is issued for the purposes of Market Research and to determine the appropriate Small Business Sourcing Strategy for this acquisition.

Under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 511210, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 23, has a requirement to expand its current TeleICU system. VISN 23 has implemented a Virtual ICU to enable improved patient care through remote intensivist expertise and alerting algorithms based upon large population patient management experience.  This coverage exists for approximately 78 ICU beds located in Des Moines, Fargo, Iowa City, Minneapolis, Omaha, Sioux Falls, and Fort Meade in VISN 23, as well as Spokane in VISN 20.   

VISN 23 is now seeking to expand beyond the existing sites to St. Cloud, Marion, Leavenworth, Topeka, St. Louis, and Wichita in the coming months.  In St. Cloud, a 17 bed respiratory dependent unit is seeking Tele-ICU coverage, but since there is no patient monitoring, Lab and ADT are the only interfaces that will be needed to Philips eCareManager software.  For Marion, Leavenworth, Topeka, St. Louis, and Wichita, Lab, ADT, CIS Flowsheet Inbound, and Vital Signs need to be interfaced with Philips eCareManager software.  Additionally, VISN 23 Tele-ICU is seeking to add the Medication Orders interface for the existing sites (Des Moines, Fargo, Iowa City, Minneapolis, Omaha, Sioux Falls, Spokane, and Fort Meade), as well as the expansion sites (St. Cloud, Marion, Leavenworth, Topeka, St. Louis, and Wichita).  The medication orders inbound interface will enable, for example, monitoring of medications for DVT prophylaxis for mechanically ventilated patients and for stress ulcer prophylaxis.  Each interface and license (for each bed and/or mobile cart) will require implementation services by the Contractor.

As more sites are being monitored by the Tele-ICU, there is an increased need for clinical reporting tools to be available for the Tele-ICU clinicians.  VISN 23 is seeking to add eSearch to the eCareManager system to provide clinical reporting tools for the clinical users.  

The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools and equipment, on-site training, maintenance, technical support, project management and supervision required to perform the work as further defined in the SOW/Specifications. The clinical functionality of the solution shall include patient registration, reporting, tracking, quality assurance and quality control, analytics and reporting, and be non-developmental, i.e. commercially available.

NAICS Code and Title: 511210, Software Publishers.

Small Business Size Standard: $35.5 million

All applicable small businesses, with a firm intention to bid on this requirement, are encouraged to respond. Interested small businesses shall submit detailed capability information on contracts they consider relevant in demonstrating their ability to perform. The statement of capabilities should include:

1.	Firm name, address, e-mail, telephone and fax numbers
2.	Small business certification - 8(a), HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran or Women-owned.
3.	Past Experience - describe your experience of similar type, size and complexity to that which is the subject of this Sources Sought.
a.	Provide a listing of three (3) most recent projects your firm has performed.
4.	Your firms Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS)
5.	Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) registered NAICS Codes.

Responses to this Sources Sought Notice can be either Mailed to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Fargo VA HCS, Contracting Office (attn: Chris Volk), 2101 Elm Street, Fargo, ND 58102, or sent via email to Christopher.Volk@va.gov. All responses must be received no later than May 24, 2013. If response is sent via email, vendor is responsible to confirm receipt as server limitations can restrict delivery of large files.

Under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 511210, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 23, is seeking a solution that supports both single sign-on for application access and preventing time-outs that are currently an issue with the Tele-ICU.  This will enable better management of the multiple usernames and passwords required for each user.

There are four Tele-ICU desks (each with two PCs) located in Minneapolis and two Tele-ICU desks (each with two PCs) in Iowa City that are used by ICU nurses and intensivists for the monitoring of ICU patients at remote locations.  At the start of a shift, the clinical user launches the following applications: Philips eCareManager, Philips ICCA (for each monitored location), Philips ICCA User Account Unlock Tool (for each monitored location), GE patient waveforms, and Philips patient waveforms.  Each application has the potential to have a different username and password for each user.  Additionally, there are varying time-out periods per application.  The following list includes the applications used on each workstation and how they are accessed.  The monitored locations are Minneapolis VA, Sioux Falls VA, Fargo VA, Omaha VA, Des Moines VA, Iowa City VA, Fort Meade VA, and Spokane VA.  There is the potential to expand to five additional VA locations this year. 

The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, tools and equipment, on-site training, maintenance, technical support, project management and supervision required to perform the work as further defined in the SOW/Specifications. The clinical functionality of the solution shall include patient registration, reporting, tracking, quality assurance and quality control, analytics and reporting, and be non-developmental, i.e. commercially available.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">LLNL has been involved in the development of technologies for fusion energy for many decades. Most recently, construction of the large-scale National Ignition Facility (NIF) at LLNL has allowed researchers to explore the potential for significant energy production from the fusion of deuterium and tritium. While deuterium is readily available from water, tritium has to be manufactured and recycled due to its inherently short lifetime. Technologies are thus required for the production, extraction, purification, storage and delivery of tritium. These processes need to be as efficient as possible to effectively eliminate any losses to the environment and to minimize the overall inventory of tritium material in the system. Present day technologies are sufficient for facilities such as the NIF, but new processes will need to be developed to allow construction of next-generation facilities, as proposed by many groups around the world. </span></p>

Conventional metals are inadequate, either due to poor mechanical properties under neutron bombardment (e.g. embrittlement), or due to unacceptable activation. Advanced materials and material processing techniques (e.g. bonding / welding) are required. </span></p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. Located within the Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) of DHS, the SAVER Program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercial equipment and systems, and provides those results along with other relevant equipment information to the emergency response community in an operationally useful form. Information provided by the SAVER Program will be shared nationally with the responder community, providing a life- and cost-saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders. For more information on the SAVER Program, visit the SAVER website at https://www.rkb.us/saver.</p>
<p>SAVER provides information on equipment that falls within the categories listed in the DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL). The AEL item numbers for the subject equipment is <br />20CS-01-AFIS. The target audience for this information is law enforcement public safety providers and their purchasing agents.</p>

<DESC>1.  The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MILTEC Corporation of Huntsville, AL (MILTEC) for Advanced Hypersonic Weapon Technology Demonstration (AHW-TD), supporting execution of AHW Flight Tests and technology development and demonstration experiments. The proposed acquisition is directed to MILTEC pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1,  quote mark Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. quote mark   Since program requirement inception MILTEC has been the only provider of services and is the only contractor capable of continuing to provide the required highly skilled contractor support consisting of scientists, engineers, technicians, chemical engineers, chemists, and environmental and safety specialists with unique hands-on expertise in state-of-the-art design and development of the AHW Hypersonic Glide Body (HGB) and/or Flight Test Vehicles (FTV) and associated technology development efforts including the supporting execution of AHW Flight Tests and technology development and demonstration experiments.  This acquisition will continue and build-up the prior work of MILTEC and it has been determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition. <br> The goal of this program is ultimately to develop, integrate, and flight test upgraded versions of the HGB, focused on evolving CPGS requirements as well as the program responsibility to support the overall CPGS community. The AHW program builds on the successful AHW Flight Test 1A to execute the follow-on technology demonstrations and design/development tasks. This activity will include Flight Test preparation and procurement of hardware necessary to support the AHW program Flight Tests as well as future development test activities.  The activities undertaken in this program will focus on continued development of the HGB and/or FTV to support the evolving CPGS requirements, as well as specific tasks assigned by OSD AT&L/SW and SMDC to include innovative weapons concepts for OSD boost-glide technology demonstration, PEO Missiles and Space short range tactical and theater hypersonic missile developments, Navy intermediate range hypersonic weapons, CSM long range hypersonic weapons, space-based range support, and satellite communication (SATCOM) technology needs. <br>  <br> 2.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. <br>  <br> 3.  This action is not open to foreign participation.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential upgrade of the following products on the PL.  The Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support is currently authorized under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act to procure the items listed below for the Department of Defense.  The potential action described in this Notice will authorize the Defense Logistics Agency to procure these items for the entire federal government.</p>
<p>NSN:		7045-01-482-7540<br />Name:		CD-R Silver w/Jewel Case, 10pk<br />Description:	CD-R Silver with jewel case, 80 minutes, 52x, 700MB. Compatible with all types and speeds of CD-R writing systems; playback compatible with all CD-ROM drives and audio CD players. UOI is EA. EA = 10 per pack</p>
<p>NSN:		7045-01-503-2033<br />Name:		CD/DVD Sleeves, Clear, 25pk<br />Description:	Double-sided storage sleeves for CDs/DVDs (without jewel cases); sleeves hold two CDs or a single CD with a booklet; includes labels/index tabs for easy identification and organization. UOI is EA. EA = 25 per pack.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Philadelphia, PA.<br /> <br />Before upgrading products from C-List to B-List, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once upgraded, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN<br />ETS Stock Numbers:</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 28, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Daniel L. Stufflebeam (DBA Educational Research Services) of Kalamazoo, MI for support services for the development of an FRA R&amp;D program evaluation capacity building strategy, including an Evaluation Implementation Plan
<p>The justification is as follows. Mr. Stufflebeam is the creator of the Context Input Process and Product (CIPP) model. FRA has utilized the CIPP model for over a decade and has customized the model for its purposes. Currently, FRA is seeking to formalize its customized model for broad application across all of R&amp;D. Mr. Stufflebeam has assisted FRA with this customization of his CIPP model. Consequently, as creator of the model and as Mr. Stufflebeam has assisted FRA in this formalization process, he is uniquely qualified to assist with the model formalization process and to provide the evaluation capacity building services described above.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Stufflebeam has international expertise in evaluation, particularly evaluation capacity building. Mr. Stufflebeam was the Director of the Evaluation Center at the Western Michigan University (WMU) for 39 years, making significant scientific contributions to the field of evaluation. He has conducted evaluations in areas that included education, community development, economic development, housing, military personnel evaluation, state and national assessment; lectured and consulted in more than twenty countries and advised and assisted many organizations in the United States and abroad, helping found the American Evaluation Association (AEA). He has authorized numerous journal articles and authored and co-edited several books on the subject. Mr. Stufflbeam has received many recognitions for this work.</p>
<p>Consequently, Mr. Stufflebeam is the only known source that can perform the level of evaluation services needed. His experience and expertise make his company the only available source to perform these services.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within fifteen days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ryan Daniels, at ryan.daniels@dot.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Troy Mobley

<a href="mailto:troy_mobley@fws.gov">troy_mobley@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a Purchase Order, by means of Sole Source, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following service:
Vendor: LEADING EDGE AVIATION, LLC
406 BURRELL AVE., LEWISTON, ID 83501-4524
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) are cooperating to monitor the status and movement of the federally endangered Peninsular bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis ssp. Nelsoni; bighorn sheep) in the Jacumba Wilderness from the 1-8 Island to the U.S./Mexico border, in San Diego and Imperial Counties, California. The proposed monitoring will provide data on the status and movement of bighorn sheep from the I-8 Island to the U.S./Mexico border and information to help us understand the interactions of the U.S bighorn sheep population in the study area with those in Mexico.
The monitoring effort requires aerial capture of bighorn sheep, which will be accomplished using a helicopter and a qualified net-gun crew. One of the USFWS's obligations under this cooperative effort is to provide a contractor for aerial capture in 2013. We previously entered into a sole source contract for aerial capture with Leading Edge on August 22, 2012 (Order Number F12PX02503  Solicitation Number F12PS00757), which they successfully completed on November 1 and 2, 2012. The period of performance for the contract ends on September 30, 2013. However, the monitoring effort is anticipated to take place in late October to early November 2013, thus a new sole source contract is needed.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION
Leading Edge meets CDFW's qualifications for liability insurance coverage, helicopter flight equipment, and Federal certification. Leading Edge successfully completed the 2012 aerial capture working under CDFW's Federal Endangered Species Act lO(A)(1)(a) recovery permit.  In addition, Leading Edge is knowledgeable of the project and the terrain found in the monitoring area and is experienced with the local population of bighorn sheep. Finally, Leading Edge is the only contractor with the above qualifications and certifications that we have identified to carry out helicopter net-gun captures for the study, and they are available to conduct the work in 2013 for $57,599.90.

MARKET RESEARCH: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at the Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN is looking for companies with the capabilities to provide anomalous activity detection (AAD) software (AADS) for multisensor persistent surveillance systems.
  The AADS will need to provide alerting of possible anomalous activities automatically detected in the field of view (FOV) of the non-static persistent surveillance Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and/or Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) sensor(s) while the anomaly is still visible.  The AADS needs to detect motion and scene change based events within an operator(s) defined inclusion zone, exclusion zone, and/or crossing of a tripwire.  Motion based anomalies comprise directly observable activities (e.g., a person running, a vehicle speeding) while scene change anomalies include detecting objects of interest that exist, entered, changed position in, or left a scene (e.g., stacked rocks, small arms/weapons).
 Many anomalous activities are composite events including both motion and scene-change based events.  On the other hand, some activities or objects are of interest without being anomalous (e.g., Be On the Lookout [BOLO] or reading license plates).  The persistent surveillance system operator will decide and tailor the criteria of anomalous activity with the AADS.  The AADS will need to provide a Software Development Kit (SDK) with a documented Application Program Interface (API) for integration with existing C2ISR Software.  The C2ISR Software will provide audible and visual alerts on the operator(s) graphic user interface (GUI) and utilize the C2(s) native slew-to-cue functions to employ other additional persistent surveillance sensors to the area of interest.
       

Submission of information regarding AADS scene-based and/or motion-based features may include but not be limited to the detection of:

Improvised Explosive Device (IED)
Holes/disturbed earth
Change in pattern of life
Digging
Small arms/weapons
Infiltration/enemy set to ambush
String wire
Stacked rocks or marking objects
Running
Package left behind
BOLO
Indirect fire
Wires
Loitering
Entering/leaving exclusion area
Vehicle Speed
Erratically moving vehicle
Lines
Change detection at night
Appearance of a vehicle
Stopped vehicle
Read license plate
At a minimum the AADS RFI responses should include the following:
Summary on the technical principles of how the software/technology functions
Rationale and/or tactical advantages of the system
Current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 
Software architecture and interoperability standards (e.g.
 SEIWG ICD-101a/b, XML-based, or proprietary)
Adherence to MIL-STD-961E, Defense and Program-Unique Specifications Format and Content, 2003
Application Programming Interface (API) that supports full integration with third-party C2 systems
Acceptable imagery formats (e.g. MPEG-4, H.264, H.265, MPEG-2 TS, etc.)
Use with dynamic sensors (e.g. pan tilt zoom or gimbal)
Sensor stabilization needed or mitigation tools
Ability of accepting a buffer of raw pixel data 
Metadata format(s) supported such as MISB 0601.X
Ability to accept metadata including platform, sensor, timestamp, geo-rectified center and corner pixels, orientation, zoom, and slant range 
Time for detection and alert to include minimum sensor dwell time required
Probability of detection (PD)  
False alarm rate and any mitigation tools 
Central processing unit (CPU) needed
Software Development and Operating System Environments supported (e.g.
 C/C++, Java, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Windows, etc.)
Ability to accept line-in-screen coordinates defining tripwires
Ability to accept operator feedback to parameterize alerts according to mover size, movement rate, and direction
Ability of operators to provide feedback or filters on alerts to avoid further alerts for a given tracked object while it remains visible in the area of interest
Can operators provide feedback or set rules to parameterize scene change detection sensitivity
Ability to provide activity alerts via a software call
When detections occur are the associated bounding box and alert type returned and supported in the API  
Ability to detect objects moving within the area of interest while the sensors FOV is unchanged
Ability to determine scene change when the cameras FOV changes and comes back to the same location
How many simultaneous events are supported
Process of removing alerts 
Minimum and maximum speeds, size, or direction for needed for detection of a target (e.g.
 personnel or vehicle)
Ability to classify a mover as a vehicle, person, or other

Universal Music - MGB NA is considered the only source that can provide a license for a searchable library of licensed music for use in creation of non-broadcast multi-media productions for internal use by the Navy.
  A change of vendors would require notification of each of the users, recovery of the loaned hard drives, re-registration of the same users for a different service, re-training of users according to the requirements of a new vendor, and redistribution of any copyrighted media.  Completion of this process would have to be coordinated with mission execution with delay of up to several weeks and would cause extra costs to be incurred in employee time.  The burden imposed by such a change would impact our mission to a significant degree.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 519120.  All responses may be emailed to Joseph Haviland at joseph.haviland1@navy.mil and reference number 6676020131564 no later than 1500 EST on 23 May 2013.

Global Technologies Group, Inc.
 is considered the supplier who can supply update services and periodic maintenance for an existing Global Digital Asset Management System (GDAMS) for the acquisition, storage, management, and distribution of still and video imagery.  The GDAMS uniquely combines required technical capability in a single, integrated functional package, and office workflow is built around this system.  Maintenance of this system is a technologically current status and is therefore the key to continued readiness and daily functionality.  Update or maintenance of the system by any other source could potentially compromise its operational readiness, would require familiarization time at additional expense, and void our current maintenance contract.

Specifically, changes in workflow and software interface characteristics, and the incorporation of new technology can only be accomplished by the OEM manufacturer acting through a designated technical agent.
  Global Technologies Group, Inc. is the sustaining vendor and is proprietary developer of the complex technical enhancements now required.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 511210.  All responses may be emailed to Joseph Haviland at joseph.haviland1@navy.mil and reference number 6676020131568 no later than 1500 EST on 23 May 2013.

<CONTACT>Katelyn Rowland, Contract Specialist, Phone 7037356414, Email Katelyn.Rowland@dodiis.mil
<DESC><p>RFI- Request for Industry Information and Comment</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE</p>
<p>A. The purpose of this RFI is to solicit feedback from industry on the acquisition strategy of DIA's next enterprise IT IDIQ Acquisition entitled Solution for the Information Technology Enterprise 2 (SITE 2).</p>
<p>B. The purpose of the SITE 2 vehicle is to provide the acquisition framework for delivering the full scope of information technology services and capabilities to support the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Services, the Combatant Commands (COCOM) and partner agency worldwide mission across the Intelligence Community (IC). SITE 2 is intended to continue the streamline procurement process for Information Technology and Information Services (IT/IS) support and will provide leadership with the capability to manage efficiently the use of IT/IS resources across the IC.</p>
<p>C. IT/IS is a family of highly specialized endeavors and its provision requires the capability to access a large pool of available talent with a diversity of experience, education, and technological capabilities. The SITE 2 contract will be established for delivering the types of services currently provided by the expiring SITE Contracts.</p>
<p>D. Currently the Government intends to make awards in the 2nd quarter of FY15. This will be a multiple award vehicle that will require contractors to propose on all sixteen service areas. Service Areas Include:</p>
<p>(1) Program Management and Planning<br />(2) Technology Assessment and Evaluation Services<br />(3) Systems Engineering Services<br />(4) Operations Support Services<br />(5) Network Operations and Administration<br />(6) Storage Services<br />(7) Web Services and Content Management<br />(8) Acquisition and Property Management Services<br />(9) Maintenance and Remote Diagnostic Services<br />(10) Administrative and Special Services<br />(11) Information Assurance (IA) Services<br />(12) Security Management <br />(13) SCI Personnel and Information Security Support<br />(14) Risk Management<br />(15) Testing and Verification Services<br />(16) Training Services</p>
<p>E. SECURITY - At a minimum, the prime contractors shall be required to have Top Secret Facility Clearances when submitting proposals. Specific task orders may have unique security requirements. These requirements could include unrestricted access to the Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters (DIA HQ) and an approved Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) within their team. Security requirements will be task order-specific.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE/ASSUMPTIONS:</p>
<p>A. The IT/IS support will cover both classified and unclassified programs; however the majority of the work will be in classified environment. The organizational scope of this effort is any DIA, Service Center, Combatant Commands, and/or deployed locations where the delivery of IT/IS support and related services is deemed necessary by the Government. This will be a global contract vehicle.&nbsp; The ceiling will be $5.0 billion.</p>
<p>B. SITE 2 is envisioned as a task-order-based, multiple-award contract with a mix of small and large business primes, each with an extensive network of teaming partners and subcontractors to satisfy the community's mission requirements. The Government shall reserve the right to designate selected task orders as set-asides for competition among the small business primes or to allow competition among all primes.</p>
<p>C. The SITE 2 contract vehicle is contemplated to include a base year plus four option years.</p>
<p>3. REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY INPUT <br /><br />The Government would like industry input regarding the following topics:</p>
<p>A. Vendors interested in being Prime Contractors or subcontractors on this vehicle.</p>
<p>B. Response time necessary to prepare a proposal in response to the RFP.</p>
<p>C. Recommendations on the pricing structure of the proposal.</p>
<p>D. Recommendations on the submission of proposals (Oral Presentations, Written, or other methods).</p>
<p>F. Recommendations for the competition strategy?</p>
<p>G. How many awards would be optimal?</p>
<p>H. What role should small business play in structuring this acquisition?</p>
<p>I. Any recommendations for incentives?</p>
<p>K. Recommendations on any suggested differences from the current SITE Program Structure.</p>
<p>L. All responses shall be submitted via email to Katelyn.Rowland@dodiis.mil no later than 5:00 PM&nbsp; EST on 28 May 2013.</p>

(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.

The MATT/MTTS is a ruggedized, tetherless, remote controlled human patient medical simulator that delivers high-fidelity simulations of lower body blast injuries commonly caused by IEDs and other sources. In order to keep the MATT/MTTS units working properly, maintenance of the units is necessary. This maintenance package includes replacement materials for the simulators, on call assistance from the vendor for minor technological issues, as well as two onsite visits where the contractor will perform routine maintenance to all MATT/MTTS units. MATT/MTTS employs state of the art special effects materials and technologies to deliver incredibly realistic visual and tactile stimuli with life like response to treatment that must be maintained in order to function properly.</p>

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, AK has a requirement to purchase GPS Iridium collar for lynx: Lightweight (<400 g) satellite-capable global positioning system (GPS) collars to monitor movements and habitat use of lynx in the Brooks Range, Alaska.  TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: I) <400 g total weight 2) Drop-off mechanism 3) 2:4 GPS relocations a day (I every 6 hours) 4) 280-370 day battery life 5) Collar length = 32 cm 6) VHF transmission> 6 hrs. Per day Lynx are small (approx. 8 kg) felids that rely on stealth and speed in variable snow and vegetation conditions to subsist on their primary prey, snowshoe hares, in the boreal regions of Alaska. Animals on this project will be captured, collared, and released in a remote region of Alaska. These animals will commonly range over large areas, thus we need a collar that acquires and transmits relocation data frequently within a relatively "light" (<400 g or 5% of average body mass) unit that can be programmed to drop off the animal before the VHF radio expires. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is G13PS00383 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66, effective 01 April 2013. The Government anticipates award of a commercial, firm-fixed price type contract.  All firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov, to be considered at award.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification Of Other Than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity - U.S. Coast Guard, C3CEN CAMS/COMMSTA<br />Product Line, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open<br />competition and hereby presents this Justification for other Than Full and Open<br />Competition (J&amp;A) for review and approval.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved - This J&amp;A seeks approval<br />to contract for structural repairs on the enhanced Mobile Incident Command Post <br />(referred to as eMICP#2) in order return the eMICP to full operational status. Due to<br />pertinent low level schematics being the sole proprietary property of the original<br />equipment manufacturer (OEM), Featherlite Incorporated, 816 7th Avenue East, Cresco,<br />IA, all standardization work requiring access to those documents will necessitate that <br />Featherlite Inc. be the sole service provider. Request approval to proceed with this <br />acquisition utilizing a firm-fixed-price contract for the purchase of parts and labor<br />necessary to realize full repairs to eMICP#2. It is anticipated that one purchase order will<br />be negotiated and awarded.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services- The requirement is to procure repairs that have been <br />identified as necessary to return eMICP#2 to fully operational capability. Repairs will <br />include, but are not limited to: resealing the roof, repairing water damaged sections, and<br />strengthen the front wall against warping. This process will repair existing damage to<br />eMICP # 2, allowing it to fulfill its operational capabilities as well reduce the risk for <br />further water damage. <br /><br />1 JB Repair of Enhanced Mobile Incident Command Post (eMICP)</p>
<p>Total Estimated Cost: 55,000.00</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open<br />Competition- 41 U.S.C 428 (a) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation<br />(FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services<br />Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". Only the OEM, Featherlite Incorporated, is capable<br />of satisfying agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. Demonstration That the nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority <br />Cited - Featherlite Incorporated is the sole developer and manufacturer of all <br />fundamental electrical, mechanical, and structural systems inherent in eMICP#1. This<br />exclusivity also includes ownership of all primary diagrams, schematics, and blueprints <br />which are critical to the repair effort. Featherlite Inc.'s proprietary knowledge base, <br />coupled with a workforce that is intimately familiar with the asset and an active facility <br />capable of meeting the USCG demands demonstrates the aforementioned authority to be<br />the only supplier capable of meeting all standardization requirements.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many<br />Potential Sources as is Practicable - In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to <br />contract for the repair of eMICP#2 will be advertised in the Electronic Posting System<br />(EPS), Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) as a combined synopsis solicitation under</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the<br />Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine Price Fair and Reasonableness from Comparison<br />of previous acquisitions for similar purchases IAW FAR 13.106-3</p>
<p>8. Description of market Research - eMICP#2 is not logistically supported by other <br />Government agencies. Featherlite Inc., the OEM, is the sole developer of eMICPs. As <br />such, any other vender would need to acquire all necessary proprietary documents from <br />Featherlite Inc., thus increasing costs and time associated with the standardization effort.<br />Further factors limiting potential vendors include the immediate capacity to modify and <br />transport equipment weighing approximately 57,000LBs, with an approximate height of <br />13FT, a length of approximately 54FT, and a width of approximately 20.5FT fully<br />extended.</p>
<p>9. Any other Facts Support the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition - As the <br />OEM, Featherlite Inc personnel are knowledgeable about the operation of the eMICP. The <br />risk of operator error causing damage is minimized by utilizing the OEM who is <br />intimately familiar with the set up procedures.</p>
<p>10. A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That expressed In writing, an Interest in the<br />Acquisition<br /><br />None know at this time.</p>
<p>11. A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May take to Remove or Overcome <br />Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies<br />or Services Required <br /><br />None at this time</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification -</p>
<p>I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of the other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p>13. Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of <br />Technical/Requirements Personnel</p>
<p>I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.</p>
<p>LT Jennifer Rogers<br />Technical Representative<br />Enhanced Mobile Incident Command Post #2(eMICP) Repairs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />April 2013<br />Prepared by<br />United States Coast Guard<br />Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center<br />4000 Coast Guard Blvd<br />Portsmouth, VA 23703</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />GENERAL<br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG), beginning in 2006, developed the enhanced Mobile Incident Command Posts (eMICPs) as part of the Mobile Command Centers (MCC) Project. VSE Cooperation completed the design and manufacture of two eMICPs in conjunction with Featherlite Trailers. The eMICP is a communications trailer providing secure and non-secure voice, radio, satellite and data transfer interoperability with Coast Guard units, State, local and Federal partners. The trailer is designed with two slide outs that extend to form a central conference room in which command operations can be maintained.</p>
<p>The eMICP #2, located at CAMS LANT in Chesapeake, VA has been deployed regularly to support both routine communications surges, like the Republican National Convention, and for disaster assistance, specifically Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Most recently, the eMICP returned from Cape Girardeau, Mo where they provided support of low water operations on the Mississippi River. Since Hurricane Sandy made landfall on 27 October 2012 eMICP #2 has been deployed 74 days in less than 4 months. The regular transportation and use, in conjunction with normal wear and tear has resulted in cracks in the laminate inside the conference space, and a leaking roof that needs resealing among other things. Repairs are necessary in order to keep eMICP #2 in a good operating condition so that it can continue the operational pace in which it has over the past year.</p>
<p>SCOPE<br />This Purchase Request (PR) provides funding to make necessary repairs to eMICP #2 to keep it in top operating condition to meet the needs of the contingency communications mission. <br /><br />This PR will provide funding for the following activities:<br />&bull; Reseal the roof<br />&bull; Fix the door in the middle of the trailer<br />&bull; Re-Key all 27 Locks<br />&bull; Replace Ceiling vents<br />&bull; Replace all cracked laminate<br />&bull; Check all inserts for slideouts for sealing issues<br />&bull; Find and fix leak in the mudroom, replace walls and all laminate,<br />&bull; Repair Communications Space access door jam. <br />&bull; Reinforce front wall/ door to minimize warping of door separate from wall<br />&bull; Repair warped deck plate<br />&bull; Fix sticking of rear external access<br />&bull; Add additional fall protection in the form of a second life line parallel to the first<br />&bull; Add hinges to outside access that does not have any<br />&bull; Touch up external access after installing hinges<br />&bull; Fix cabinet door in communications space</p>
<p>SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE<br />Accessibility Requirements (Section 508) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology (EIT), they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities. Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.</p>
<p>All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508 unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable EIT accessibility standards have been identified:</p>
<p>1.2.1 Section 508 Applicable EIT Accessibility Standards<br />36 CFR 1194.21 Software Applications and Operating Systems, applies to all EIT software applications and operating systems procured or developed under this work statement including but not limited to GOTS and COTS software. In addition, this standard is to be applied to Web-based applications when needed to fulfill the functional performance criteria. This standard also applies to some Web based applications as described within 36 CFR 1194.22.<br /><br />36 CFR 1194.22 Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) then 1194.21 Software standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.</p>
<p>36 CFR 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverable shall use technical standards, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria.</p>
<p>36 CFR 1194.41 Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that documents and reports fulfill the required 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria, they shall comply with the technical standard associated with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum. In addition, any help or support provided in this work statement that offer telephone support, such as, but not limited to, a help desk shall have the ability to transmit and receive messages using TTY.</p>
<p>1.2.2 Section 508 Applicable Exceptions<br />Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by DHS and only the exceptions described herein may be applied. Any request for additional exceptions shall be sent to the COTR and determination will be made in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. DHS has identified the following exceptions that may apply: 36 CFR 1194.3(b) Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal employee(s) or member(s) of the public. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the public.</p>
<p>1.2.3 Section 508 Compliance Requirements<br />36 CFR 1194.2(b) (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:<br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or<br />(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).<br />(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

Award of Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Orders shall be made on a competitive basis, using the  quote mark best-value Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote mark  process.  The Government intends to award a minimum of two (2)  and a maximum of six (6) Purchase Orders depending upon the availability of funds.    <br>        <br>    2.  The LPTA process does not permit tradeoffs between price and non-price factors in accordance with FAR Part 15; thus, the Government will award to responsible vendors who meet or exceed the acceptability standards for non-price factors with the lowest evaluated price.  The evaluation factors are listed below.    <br>        <br>    Factor 1 - Technical Capability    <br>    Factor 2 - Past Performance    <br>    Factor 3 - Price    <br>        <br>    3.  The Government evaluators will not assume that the vendor's quote possesses any capability or knowledge unless it is specified in the quote.      <br>        <br>    4.  The Government intends to evaluate and award Purchase Orders without discussions.  However, the Government reserves the  right to conduct discussions.  If discussion are required, they will be conducted with vendors in the competitive range to the extent deemed necessary by the Procuring Contracting Officer IAW FAR 15.306.    <br>        <br>    5.  If any of the above non-price factors receives an individual rating of  quote mark Unacceptable, quote mark  the vendor's quote will deemed  quote mark Unacceptable quote mark  and removed from further consideration.  Only quotes receiving an overall rating of  quote mark Acceptable quote mark  will be considered for award.    <br>        <br>    (b) EVALUATION CRITERIA    <br>        <br>    1.  Factor 1 - Technical Capability    <br>        <br>    The vendor's quote will be evaluated to the degree to which the vendor's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide litters with the requested technicalcapabilities,specifications, salient characteristics that meet or exceed the minimum essential characteristics.  The degree to which the Offeror's technical quote demonstrates to the government evaluators that the offeror can provide delivery and training as stated in the Statement of Need. The degree to which the training package demonstrates to the Government a clear understanding of each system must be met. The degree in which the systems parts list will be clear and complete so that the Government will have a full understanding of what makes up each system.  Table 1 identifies the ratings for Factor 1.    <br>        <br>    Table 1:  Factor 1 Ratings    <br>    Rating	           Description    <br>    Acceptable ---   Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.    <br>    Unacceptable --- Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.      <br>        <br>    2.  Factor 2 - Past Performance    <br>        <br>    a.  The past performance will be evaluated on the basis of the vendor's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in services that meets the requirements of the Statement of Need.  The Government will conduct a past performance risk evaluation that will be based on the quality, relevance, and currency of the Offeror's past performance on products and services of similar size, scope, and complexity within similar periods of performance as it related to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort.   A purchase order or contract of similar nature is a contract of comparable risk - functions, responsibilities, and control exercised by the Contractor which is essentially the same as required under the Request for Quote solicitation.    <br>        <br>    b.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of demonstrating relevancy of the past performance and expectation based on the relevant past performance that the requirements will successfully be performed rests with the Offeror.  Other sources available to the Government include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The vendor must provide a list of 3 references of relevant past and present contracts for Federal, State and/or City agencies and commercial customers within the past 3 years.   quote mark Relevant quote mark  is defined as like items as stated in this solicitation's Statement of Work in terms of similar characteristics and quantities.  References must include:    <br>        <br>    Name of the Organization that will be providing the reference,     <br>    Name of the Point of Contact (POC),     <br>    POC Telephone Number,    <br>    POC Email address,     <br>    Contract Number,     <br>    Period of Performance, and    <br>    Description of goods/services rendered.     <br>        <br>    c.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the Offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.    <br>        <br>    Table 2:  Factor 2 Ratings    <br>    Rating	        Description    <br>    Acceptable ---  Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the vendor will successfully perform the required effort, or the vendor's performance record is unknown.    <br>    Unacceptable --- Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the vendor will be able to succesffuly perform the required effort.    <br>        <br>        <br>    3.  Factor 3 - Price    <br>        <br>    Price will be evaluated separately from past performance and other non-price factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price will be evaluated for reasonableness in terms of:    <br>        <br>    3.1.  Consistency with the requirement's acceptable technical capabilities in the vendor's technical quote;     <br>        <br>    3.2.  Price quote evaluation is to determine whether vendor's price quote is fair and reasonable, the Government will evaluate the completeness and reasonableness of vendor's price quote.  The Procuring Contracting Officer may conduct a cost analysis to support the price determination using Contract Pricing Reference Guide (https://acc.dau.mil/cprg).    <br>        <br>    3.3.  Option Items.  The Government will evaluate quotes for Purchase Orders award purposes by adding the total price for option item to the total price of the basic requirement for each  product type.   The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the quote for option prices is significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.     <br>        <br>    (end of provision)    <br>        <br>    52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEC 2012)    <br>    52.247-29 	F.O.B.

This RFI does not commit the U.S. Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, the U.S. Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI and all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any RFP, if one is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.      <br>            <br>      Program Manager Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (PM-WIN-T) Increment 1 (Inc 1) seeks industry feedback regarding the Signal Modernization Program initiatives.  The Signal Modernization Program will transform and augment the Army's communication capabilities and extend the network to lower echelons via modular, scalable and interoperable nodes.  Operational requirements have pushed the need for nodes lower in the formation. These nodes will operate in commercial and military satellite bands and will support up to four enclaves with voice, data and video teleconferencing. These requirements will be executed via the Transmission Capability Production Document (CPD) and the Transportable Tactical Command Communications (T2C2) (CPD). Both CPD documents are still in the approval process with expected approval in 4QFY13 for T2C2 and late 1QFY14 for Transmission.  Formal guidance required to proceed with the acquisition program is being addressed with a Directed Requirement currently being staffed.        <br>            <br>      To demonstrate Signal Modernization initiatives, the Expeditionary Signal Battalion (ESB)  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  will demonstrate materiel and organizational changes in the ESB structure in order to provide increased network capacity / capabilities to support Command Posts (Company through Brigade) and to Install, Operate and Maintain (IOM) these capabilities without increasing organizational manning.   The intent is to reconfigure the 86th ESB at FT Bliss, TX and select Regional Hub Nodes (RHNs) to conduct a series of operational and system evaluations in FY 14-15.  These evaluations will include support to Maneuver Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and Functional Brigades and will be conducted in conjunction with the Brigade Modernization Command (BMC) sponsored Network Integration Evaluations (NIEs).  The US Army Signal Center of Excellence (SigCoE) will use the  quote mark Proof of Concept quote mark  to confirm that the ESB can provide increased capacity / capabilities within full spectrum operations; support additional Command Posts; meet IOM requirements within the ESB force structure and reduce signal footprint / strategic lift requirements.      <br>            <br>      Extension of the Army's network footprint will be addressed via the T2C2 program.  T2C2 provides small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides Global Information Grid (GIG) access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while At-the-Halt (ATH) on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.      <br>            <br>      Executive Summary      <br>            <br>      PM-WIN-T Inc 1is seeking industry feedback on five technology areas:  Terrestrial Line-of-Sight radios, Tropospheric Scatter technology, Deployable Cellular systems, Radio cross-banding, and Man-portable SATCOM systems.      <br>            <br>      Satellite communications is the primary connectivity between WIN-T Increment 1 and Increment 2 equipment. Incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations. PM WIN-T Inc 1 is looking for a solution that directly links WIN-T Increments 1 and 2 using high bandwidth terrestrial communications.        <br>            <br>      Additionally, PM WIN-T INC 1 is looking to replace the existing Tropospheric scatter (TROPO) communications equipment in the   ESBs   to provide greater throughput, require less manning and have significant deployment and employment advantages in size, weight, and power.      <br>            <br>      An interface to the WIN-T system is required to support soldier cellular data devices. These devices utilize a transport base station that will reside in WIN-T equipment. This capability is required at all command posts, echelons division through company, that are supported with WIN-T equipment. Cellular capability is also required at ESBs to support command posts that do not have organic WIN-T assets.      <br>            <br>      Provide small teams and company-sized early entry units robust voice and data communications capabilities in the early phases of joint operations. T2C2 supports Mission Command Applications and services. Variant 1 provides GIG access to the small, highly dispersed team-size elements while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites. Variant 2 provides high capacity GIG connectivity to company size units command posts while ATH on military satellites or commercial satellites.      <br>            <br>      Finally, provide a solution allowing connections between telephones, combat net radios, first responder radios and voice applications into a single, on-call voice network. The capability to bridge disparate voice devices into a net will be available from Corps through company echelons. Network management for this capability resides at Corps through battalion echelons.      <br>            <br>      Requirements      <br>            <br>      Terrestrial Transmission System      <br>            <br>      PM WIN-T Inc 1seeks industry feedback regarding availability of a production representative  high capacity line of sight radio that will meet the terrestrial transmission requirement of the Tactical Network Modernization for the ESBs which will allow Soldiers to seamlessly communicate between WIN-T Increments. Currently, each WIN-T increment leverages different waveforms which are not compatible.  Inc 1 employs the HCLOS UHF radio in the AN/TRC-190 and Inc 2 is fielding the On-the-Move capable Highband Networking Waveform.  These incompatibilities between the terrestrial radios in the WIN-T increments cause inefficiencies in the network which are detrimental to military operations.   Therefore, PM WIN-T INC 1 is seeking terrestrial transmission hardware platform that shall be capable of porting waveforms used by WIN-T to allow interoperability between Increments.      <br>            <br>      The terrestrial transport shall provide 32 Mbps measured point to point) (threshold), and 48 Mbps (objective) data throughput at 30 km per link.

<DESC>The project involves floodplain restoration on approximately 9 acres adjacent to Upper Newsome Creek and reconstruction of Haysfork Sediment Pond. The activities will mitigate the environmental impacts of past dredge and placer mining. The work includes the regrading floodplain along with associated dredge pile relocation, earthwork and revegetation. Work at the sediment pond includes removal of existing features and construction of a new spillway. Revegetation of the disturbed sites will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.&nbsp; Optional items have been included for additional dredge pile relocation, mulching/seeding/slash placement&nbsp;and soil source stockpiling.&nbsp; Optional items shall be awarded concurrent with the base items as funding allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;A contractor will be required to provide a qualified stream restoration specialist to represent them and supervise during the following construction activities: 1) equipment operation required for site access (setting temporary bridges at stream crossings), 2) equipment operation within the active channel or on stream banks, 3) floodplain construction quality control (Government estimates 2 days per week) and 4) sediment pond spillway construction. The representative shall possess a Bachelor's degree in fish biology, hydrology, geomorphology, engineering or a related field, at a minimum, though a Master's degree is preferred. In addition, the representative shall possess a minimum of 10 years related experience and a minimum of 3-5 years of experience performing/overseeing similar stream restoration projects.</p>
<p>The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho. To reach the project site, travel approximately 40 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction with Newsome Creek Road (Forest Service Road 1858). Proceed up Newsome Creek Road, past the old Newsome Townsite, approximately 7 miles to a gated access road that takes off sharply uphill and to the right. This road can be identified by the large boulders that have been placed by the gate. A similar road takes off just prior to this access road but no boulders are present. Motorized access is prohibited. The project site is located approximately 1 &frac12; miles from the gate. A formal pre-bid tour is not planned at this time. <br /><br />The estimated price range for the project if the base and all optional items are awarded is between $500,000-$1,000,000. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. This project constitutes Phase III of a multi-phase project. Phases I and II, located upstream from the current project area, were completed in 2011 and 2012.<br /><br />Solicitation was issued on 4/19/13.&nbsp; Performance period for the work is July 15-October 31, 2013.&nbsp; In stream work must be completed prior to September 30, 2013.&nbsp; Bid bonds are required.&nbsp; FAXed offers shall not be accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Solicitation was amended on 5/13/2013 to add pricing instructions to Section B of the solicitation.&nbsp; A signed copy of this amendment must be submitted with any offer; response deadline remains unchanged.<br /><br />This acquisition has been set aside for HUBZone Concerns.&nbsp; Offerors must be certified HUBZone concerns with the U.S. Small Business Administration to be eligible for consideration.&nbsp; For information regarding the on-line application process, go to the following website at <a href="https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/">https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/</a>.&nbsp; The certification&nbsp;process can take more than 90 days to complete.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0002 has been posted to this annoucement. 

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Divisions intends to solicit competitive proposals for providing an Indefinite Delivery Requirements contract to fabricate and assemble approximately 130,500 Emergency Escape Breathing Devices (EEBD), 960 EEBD Training Units, and 250 EEBD Instructional Videos with training materials. The EEBD is designed to provide respiratory and eye protection in an atmosphere that will not support life. The EEBD will be used by U.S. Navy personnel to provide breathing gas for escape from spaces aboard Navy ships where atmospheres are classified as Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health /(IDLH). The primary use of the EEBD is for escape from a shipboard fire.
 The EEBD will be either stored in a protective container or worn on the belt. Navy shipboard use will expose the EEBD to temperature extremes, rough handling, shock, vibration, X-RAYs, magnetic fields and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The EEBD shall be approved by the National Institute of Safety and Health (NIOSH) with a Cap 1 capacity rating as defined by Code of Federal Regulations Title 42 Part 84 and have a shelf-life of not less than 15 years. NIOSH certification as well as third party testing of the EEBD shall be completed prior to submitting a proposal. This will be explained in further detail in the Request for Proposal. The EEBDs will be manufactured in accordance with the EEBD Specification provided with the contract solicitation.
 The draft EEBD Specification is attached to this synopsis. 

A Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements contract with a 12 month base period and four one year option periods is contemplated. A technical proposal is required. Award of the contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the offeror whose proposal is deemed to represent the best value to the Government considering technical merit and price. NSWC PCD plans on releasing the solicitation electronically only on or about 20 March 2013. No questions will be accepted until the RFP has been issued. Once the RFP has been issued, all questions concerning the RFP shall be e-mailed to Contract Specialist Kayla Nelson at kayla.m.nelson@navy.mil no later than 15 days after issuance of the RFP.
 The Government will only respond to written questions by an amendment to the RFP. NAICS Code 332911 applies. Small Business size standard is 500 employees. FSC 4240 applies.

Specifically, this solicitation activity will be for the Program Support Services single award IDIQ contract as a small business set-aside (SDVOSB). Moreover, due to the strong potential for conflicts of interest, the vendor and its subcontractors that are awarded the Program Support Services contract will be excluded from participating as a prime contractor or team member/subcontractor at any level under the other six aviation support contracts.
<p>CONFERENCE OBJECTIVE:<br />INL/A intends to ensure that potential offerors have complete understanding of Air Wing requirements and that our SOR expresses them in adequate detail, while clearly reflecting Air Wing priorities and risk concerns. To that end, INL/A staff will conduct a day-long discussion with attendees to cover in detail the draft Statement of Requirements (SOR), and associated risk assessment for each of the line items. Attendees should be prepared to discuss the agenda items with Air Wing staff, and other industry representatives in an open, group forum. Before the conference, INL/A will post the first draft of the subject Statement of Requirements (SOR) for your reference.</p>

<DESC>I. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL), a SAVER Technical Agent, is seeking information on commercially available live scan fingerprint systems suitable for law enforcement agencies transitioning from paper and ink to electronic fingerprint acquisition. This RFI is limited to systems with the following characteristics:<br />&bull; Capable of acquiring forensic quality exemplar prints consisting of individual rolled fingerprints as well as plain thumb and four finger flat slap prints;<br />&bull; Applicable for use as a desk top or fixed-station system; <br />&bull; Certified as tested and in compliance with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) Image Quality Specifications (IQS); and<br />&bull; Consisting of a system of hardware and associated software with user interface ready for or customizable to law enforcement end users.<br />Excluded from this RFI are components intended for solution providers; systems designed to operate in a mobile environment, for fast capture or for high throughput field enrollment of large populations, and those designed for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) single finger applications or identification flats for civil applicants.
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to assist emergency responders making procurement decisions. Located within the Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) of DHS, the SAVER Program conducts objective assessments and validations on commercial equipment and systems, and provides those results along with other relevant equipment information to the emergency response community in an operationally useful form. Information provided by the SAVER Program will be shared nationally with the responder community, providing a life- and cost-saving asset to DHS, as well as to Federal, state, and local responders. For more information on the SAVER Program, visit the SAVER website at https://www.rkb.us/saver.</p>
<p>SAVER provides information on equipment that falls within the categories listed in the DHS Authorized Equipment List (AEL). The AEL item numbers for the subject equipment is <br />20CS-01-AFIS. The target audience for this information is law enforcement public safety providers and their purchasing agents.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong></p>
<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013</strong>&nbsp; </em><em>BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $2,000,000 to $2,500,000</em>; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013 </strong>The contract will range in value from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000.</em></p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>

<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013</strong>&nbsp; </em><em>BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $2,000,000 to $2,500,000</em>; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013 </strong>The contract will range in value from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000.</em></p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

<DESC>NASA created the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project to explore and document the feasibility, benefits, and technical risk of vehicle concepts and enabling technologies that will reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.  Today's current generation of aircraft has benefitted from NASA investments in aeronautical research that have improved fuel efficiencies, lowered noise levels, and lessened harmful emissions. Although substantial progress has been made, much more needs to be done.  The nation's air transportation system will expand by a factor of two or three within the next two decades, potentially increasing aviation's impact on climate change.  The ERA Project works to reduce the environmental harm that could result from such an expansion. The ERA Project is focusing on environmental issues associated with aircraft, including fuel burn, emissions, and noise.  The Project is exploring and documenting the feasibility, benefits, and technical risk of vehicle concepts and enabling technologies identified to have the potential to mitigate the impact of aviation on the environment. This technology development directly supports the National Aeronautics Research and Development Policy to develop appropriate environmental protection measures to ensure continued growth in air transportation. Among the technologies being explored in the ERA Project are the following: 	Unconventional aircraft configurations that have higher lift to drag ratio, reduced drag and reduced community noise; 	Drag reduction through laminar flow; 	Advanced composite structural concepts for weight reduction; 	Low NOx combustors; and 	Propulsion and airframe integration for noise reduction and fuel-burn improvements. The primary structural concept being developed under the ERA program in the Airframe Technology element is the Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) design. The PRSEUS design approach is part of the ERA effort to address fuel burn (C02 emissions) by reducing the weight of advanced structures.  Reducing fuel burn reduces the need to use resources and reduces pollution.  PRSEUS represents a new concept in composite design theory and manufacturing methods.  It is a conscious progression away from conventional laminated and bonded assemblies toward larger one-piece panel designs with seamless transitions and damage-arrest interfaces such as stitch rows and tear straps.  It focuses on a new structural concept that integrates skin, stringers, and frame elements into a single large panel in which all elements are simultaneously cured (or co-cured) in one high-temperature cure cycle.  The resulting structure is a novel solution for addressing the demanding fuselage loading requirements inherent in a pressurized shaped vehicle like the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) concept.  The PRSEUS concept builds upon, extends, and tailors these structural technologies in order to meet the demanding challenges associated with vehicles with shapes and load paths different from todays traditional wing and circular fuselage structures. Having demonstrated the unique capability of the HWB PRSEUS structural concept to economically produce large integrated structural panels, the primary airframe design challenge now becomes the validation of the structural performance in the combined loading environment of the HWB pressure shell. Under these conditions, skin panels must not only have continuous load paths in both directions (i.e., Nx and Ny), they must also be effective in transmitting internal pressure loads (i.e., Nz) for the near-flat panel geometry.  Demonstration of this capability is the primary purpose of the Multi-bay Box Test Article.  LaRC will subject the Multi-bay Box Test article to a series of tests in the Combined Loads Test System (COLTS) test facility at LaRC.  Among other conditions, the large loading platens in COLTS will be used to impart a bending moment on the test article as it is simultaneously pressurized.  This nonlinear design regime will be used to demonstrate the structural performance of the PRSEUS concept, so that the weight penalty associated with the non-circular HWB pressure cabin can be quantitatively assessed.  The objective/scope of this task order is the fabrication and delivery of structural panels using the PRSEUS concept for use in the large scale Multi-bay Box Test Article. This action is awarded as a task order against NNL10AA05B with the Boeing Corporation under the attached Justification for Exception to Fair Opportunity Process.

<DESC>Addition of a 3000 square foot Vehicle Bay for additional and more modern fire fighting apparatus.  A storefront system shall be provided in place of the existing overhead doors to allow day lighting to the new office space in the historical vehicle bay. The design is to present a new, more professional entrance into the administrative and supervisory areas of the fire Department. Work areas inside the first floor will be created for proper storage of gear, cleaning of self contained breathing apparatus equipment, decontamination requirements, and personnel locker space. The building envelope will be improved through greater insulation and decreased infiltration in the course of renovating the space for productivity and efficiency improvements.
Exterior repairs will include: Repairing /replacing in kind and re-painting the fascia; Masonry repointing and/or replacement as necessary to decrease air and water infiltration; Caulking around windows and openings.
Demolition shall include the removal of the wood storage shed complex with its associated utilities located behind
Building 29 (east side of building).
 The Electrical emergency power loads shall be connected to the existing Diesel generator.  The design shall provide Circuit modifications to the main power panels in the building to separate critical and non-critical loads for emergency operation.
The additional, 3000 square foot single story truck bay shall be constructed on the north end of the building.
Domestic water, sanitary sewer, and storm drain will require relocation to allow construction. The design concept for the additional bay is a one story addition with a shallow single pitch roof shedding to a new filtration drip edge. Final design and choice of finishes will be determined by the A&E working through the PWDME cultural resources department.
 Pairs of overhead doors shall be provided on each end of the truck bay to allow the deployment of four full size trucks without front to back stacking.

<AWARDEE>BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON INC.;8283 GREENSBORO DR;MCLEAN;VA;221024904
<DESC>LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION


1.  Identify the agency and contracting activity.

This justification is executed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, CAI-Frederick on behalf of Veterans Health Administration, Office of Communications (10B2).

2.  Nature/description of the action/contract type.

The government intends to negotiate a logical follow-on Task Order with Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) for continuing Strategic Outreach Support Services.  These services are currently being provided under the Contract VA798-10-D-0128 task order 19. The current task order has a period of performance ending 9/26/11. 

During the current task order BAH provided Strategic Outreach Support that included a detailed "Segmented Audience Study and Analysis"; a proposed "Integrated Strategic Communications Plan"; a sub-strategy "Health & Healing Communications Plan"; a VHA "Graphic Style Guide"; and a sub-strategy "Health & Healing Graphic Style Guide."  These core documents are laying the foundation for transforming VHA communications to provide audience-focused, evidence-based messaging in support of the Under Secretary for Health's new strategy for "VA Health Care | Defining EXCELLENCE in the 21st Century."  

3.  Description of supplies/services.

The follow-on task order will mirror the services Booz Allen Hamilton is currently providing and translate from plans into action key recommendations within the BAH "Integrated Strategic Communications Plan."  The tasks requested align with key steps needed to ensure communications support as VHA undergoes major reorganization and establishes new models of health care that must be communicated more widely and effectively than ever before.  Execution of these tasks will position to support future operations.  This is in keeping with the Under Secretary for Health's new strategy, the published "VHA Strategic Plan," and the transformational initiatives undertaken and tracked at the behest of the Secretary.  

Following are the tasks that were identified;  includes partnership between the VHA Office of Communications and the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs to undertake Website usability studies and upgrades; media surveillance and analytics using commercial-grade Internet tools; process and performance tracking using VA's Sharepoint infrastructure capabilities; and further application and dissemination of the approved "Graphic Style Guide" via traditional and online media in Central Office and the field.  

Proposed New Tasks
1.  Web usability assessment and strategy for upgrades
2.  Pilot implementation of "VOCUS" Internet capabilities for media surveillance and analytics to guide communications targeting
3.  Process and performance measures development to guide implementation within VA's Sharepoint infrastructure across Central Office and field communications
4.  Application of the new "Graphic Style Guide" in print, video and online media, with support for Central Office and field communications to disseminate and diffuse the "VHA brand" to internal and external audiences


Execution of these tasks as a logical follow-on is advantageous to the Government as BAH has already gained extensive institutional knowledge of VHA Communications and would be ready to begin implementation of tasks immediately upon award.  In addition, it will maintain the continuity needed to ensure that these implementations align with the Under Secretary for Health's aggressive commitment to new models of care and health care management requiring wide and effective communications outreach.  

The follow-on task order will have a performance period of one year from the date of award. The estimated value of this requirement is $1,906,324.00.

4.  Identification of justification rationale.

In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii) exception to fair opportunity for LFO under IDIQ,
the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Firm Fixed Price task order for Strategic Outreach Support Services that was competed in accordance with the applicable contract ordering procedures.  

5.  A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value to the Government.

Re-competing this requirement would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate pricing and determine the price to be fair and reasonable before awarding a new task order.

6.  A description of market research conducted.

No market survey was conducted since these services are follow-on requirements to existing services.  Market surveys were conducted at the time of the original award.

7.  Any other supporting facts.

The sole-source contract is advantageous to the Government as BAH has gained extensive institutional knowledge of the Under Secretary's strategy by conducting in-depth interviews with forty (40) top VHA executives in Central Office and the field, conducting an extensive communications materials audit, conducting a Veteran demographic assessment, conducting a traditional and online media scan, and conducting Web and social media benchmarking.  This follow-on task order will continue the Strategic Outreach Support Services work that has been done during the current task order and move the VHA Communications program forward toward implementation of cited deliverables.  

8.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition.  

This method of awarding follow-on task orders is not considered a barrier to competition.  Booz Allen Hamilton was the successful contractor under competition that was conducted for the services currently in place.
