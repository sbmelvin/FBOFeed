<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Karoly Kasa, Hungary.  The purpose of this procurement is to acquire professional services to assist in the implementation of a Homeland Security Digital Library Federated Search Prototype (HSDLFSP).  The period of performance is for six (6) months with one six-month option period.
 
Background and Purpose: 
Historically, the Specialized Information Services Division (SIS) of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has developed specialized search technologies to provide access to heterogeneous information resources. 
Increasingly, useful and reliable information of interest to NLM/SIS and other federal agencies, such as the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), is available on the World Wide Web via Web-accessible databases outside of NLM/SIS and the NPS. In order to continue their role as focal points for providing access to information of high quality and currency, the NPS and NLM/SIS are pursuing collaborative projects for the more effective utilization of their information resources in support of their missions by utilizing ToxSeek, an innovative federated search engine being developed by NLM/SIS. 
ToxSeek has been identified as a potentially relevant tool to serve as the core federated search capability for the NPS Homeland Security Digital Library Prototype.
Scope of Work:

Building on specialized expertise in software development work on the ToxSeek search technology, the contractor shall accomplish the following tasks in implementing a HSDLFSP: (1) Connect the NLM ToxSeek server to selected licensed Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) databases via the NPS proxy server (IP authenticated); (2) Meet basic HSDL/NPS portal design requirements as constrained by current ToxSeek User Interface capabilities; (3) Configure access to a minimum of 12 existing NPS databases of varying complexity and; (4) Provide assistance and training, where necessary, to help HSDL/NPS customize the software to meet HSDL/NPS requirements and implement a successful pilot.

Deliverables:

At the conclusion of the HSDLFSP pilot implementation, the executables of the HSDLFSP federated search program will be installed and tested on a server at NPS.

NLM has determined that Mr. Kasa is uniquely qualified to provide the above services.  He has highly specialized and unique expertise, having designed the overall system architecture and innovative proprietary features of the ToxSeek distributed search and thesaurus technologies at NLM.  The NPS/NLM Inter-Agency Agreement specifically requires the integration of ToxSeek technologies into the Homeland Security Digital Library Federated Search Prototype.  Mr. Kasa has six years of experience in performing these services, 2 1/2 of them with NLM.  Mr. Kasa has earned a Master of Computer Science with substantial hands-on experience in information retrieval, database management, distributed processing, natural language processing and meta-search technology software development.  Mr. Kasa has knowledge of the following software, all of which are necessary to perform these services: Java, Javascript, SQL, UML, SOAP, XML/XSL/XSLT JAXP JAX/RPC JSP, JSF WSDL
This proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  NLM Synopsis No. NLM 04-090/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence regarding this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Ebsco Information Services to procure serial issues published in Australia and New Zealand in 2003.  These issues are necessary to fill a gap in NLM’s collection of biomedical serials.

NLM has a requirement to procure approximate 300 titles.  NLM has determined that Ebsco Information Services is uniquely qualified to supply these issues because Ebsco already has the serial issues in place, ready to deliver.  

Background – NLM previously ordered these biomedical serials from another vendor.  Before delivery or payment was made, that vendor claimed bankruptcy.  Ebsco Information Services purchased all of the accounts and holdings of the original vendor.  Therefore, Ebsco has the order in place.

This proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The FAA has a requirement for repair services in support of the Stand Alone Weather Sensor (SAWS).  The SAWS senses weather conditions for air traffic personnel.  This requirement is comprised of six weather sensor components as follows:  Power Supply Module, NSN 6130-01-483-2062, P/N S1439; ZENO-3200 Data Logger, NSN 6660-01-483-2664, P/N S1436; Sensor Unit Enclosure Assembly with Radio, NSN 6660-01-483-2928, P/N S1462; AT/RH Aspirated Sensor Assembly, NSN 6685-01-483-2616, P/N S1445; Control Display Unit with Radio, NSN 7021-01-483-2668, P/N S1433; Sensor Display Unit, NSN 7025-01-483-2720, P/N S1434. The proposed contract is for a base year with option provisions to renew for four additional one-year periods.  These repair services are only known to be available from Coastal Environmental Systems a division of Coastal Climate Company, because they hold the data rights and repair specifications.  The FAA does not have available complete technical documentation to allow other sources to repair and support the system. To receive consideration as a potential repair source, any other concern must provide in writing a complete set of system specification drawings, all required standards and testing specifications, test plans/procedures, and part lists.  Documentation must clearly demonstrate that the concern has ownership or legal access to required original equipment manufacturer documentation, equipment listings applicable to the SAWS as well as replacement parts necessary to affect the repairs.  Statements that data will be obtained or that specifications or drawings will be developed are not acceptable. Vendors must respond directly to the contracting officer identified in the market survey.  Mark responses to this survey with Market Survey File #04-57988, to arrive by March 31, 2004.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>The Philippines has an estimated population of 82 million people (2003) and is increasing by almost 2 million every year. Although it started from a relatively privileged position in the 1950s, the Philippines has never experienced the economic growth of its Asian neighbors.  At current population growth rates, and with about half of the population under the age of 20 years, the total population size is likely to double to 160 million within the next thirty years.  What this means is that mass poverty on a national scale will be difficult to reduce, and infectious diseases and malnutrition will continue at high levels. The Philippines already faces difficulties in attaining the country's Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction even when medium-term economic output growth targets are attained, and the challenges will only increase if population growth rates remain high.

The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) has been promoting and delivering family planning services, in improving maternal and child health and in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS for many years.  Yet, experience over the past several decades has shown that their public sector health service delivery model at the national level has not produced the desired results.  At the same time, the large and innovative private sector remains a major under-utilized asset for delivery of basic services such as family planning and other primary care services.

The objective of the “Increased Private Sector Involvement in Family Planning” Project is to assist in increasing the share of the private sector in meeting the “total need for family planning” by women of reproductive age using modern methods obtained from private sector sources and the total number of women of reproductive age who say they want to space or limit their family size. The following market changes are expected to be achieved:  (a) the shift of current users of modern methods from public to private sources; and, (b) the increase of new users of modern methods using the private sector supplies.  It will do this by working to: increase support for family planning within the formal employment sector; establish a viable mass-market brand of pills, injectables and other contraceptives in the commercial sector; and increase the business value of private providers' medical practices in providing family planning services.  The project will be national in scope and will include policy activity designed to create a positive environment for implementing private sector products and services. It will work to encourage the development of financing mechanisms, such as private health insurance for family planning services and products. The project will build on work already undertaken in the private sector. 
 
 USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the five year program beginning on or about October 1, 2004.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP documents that will be available on or about April 1, 2004 on this website. The closing date for the submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 60 days thereafter.  To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 BOX #1, FPO AP 96515, or Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Blvd. 1308 Pasay City, Philippines.  You may also send your requests by e-mail to marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP.  Our telephone nos. are (632) 552-9926 and (632) 552-9924.  Our fax nos. are (632) 551-9297 and (632) 552-9999. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Internet.  By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5" floppy disk (MS WordXP format), via e-mail, or in hard copy.  The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website.  The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. 

As the recipient of this solicitation document, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.  USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes.  Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on the same Internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690.  Under this requirement, the Contractor will update and refine two impact evaluation methodologies developed for ENERGY STAR in the commercial buildings market, complete development of the industrial sector evaluation methodology and explore an impact evaluation methodology for natural gas.  This work is critical to the continued success of the ENERGY STAR partnerships.  Dr. Marvin Horowitz of Demand Research is uniquely qualified to perform this work as he created the top down evaluation methodology for the Green Lights program and prepared a study entitled “Climate Protection Impacts for EPA’s Green Lights Partnership” which was successful at capturing both the direct and indirect impacts of the partnership in the commercial lighting market.  To date, no evaluation study has offered this kind of analytical treatment of the market for an energy efficient product; and the econometric model used in the study is the only one of its kind in the country.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA’s requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this notice must be in writing and sent via email to Semones.Tom@epa.gov, via facsimile (202) 565-2554, or to the following mailing address: U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001, ATTN: Tom Semones (6202R).

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to solicit proposals with the intent of signing an agreement with an organization having the capability to develop, maintain, and coordinate a prime vendor program in accordance with Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, Public Law 102-585, “Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities”.  Section 340B provides that drug manufacturers who sign a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement, as the manufacturers are required to do by Section 1927 (a) of the Social Security Act, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services agree to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs to covered entities that will not exceed the amount determined under a statutory formula (ceiling price).  Section 340B also mandates the establishment of a prime vendor program.  Consistent with this mandate, HRSA has developed a program which consists of both price negotiation and drug distribution for covered entities that elect to participate in the prime vendor program (member entities).  The offer that submits a technically-acceptable responsive proposal that offers the best value to member entities will be selected as the Prime Vendor.  The Prime Vendor shall operate as an independent entity and not as an agent of the Government.  No Federal funds will be awarded to the Prime Vendor under this Agreement.  The Prime Vendor shall provide, directly or by subcontract, all drug/pharmaceutical items authorized under Section 340B for distribution to all member entities.  The Prime Vendor has the option to offer other catalog items, as appropriate.  In addition, the Prime Vendor shall negotiate sub-ceiling prices for the benefit of the member entities.  HRSA reserves the right not to award an Agreement if it is determined that no organization meets the technical and business criteria enumerated in the HRSA Request for Agreement.  A Request for Agreement HRSA 232-BPHC-AG-01(4)FM is anticipated to be released within 60 days from release of this notice.  Offerors will have sixty days from release of the Request for Agreement to submit their proposal.

<DESC>HSCG87-04-R-643104 - Multiple Award Task Order Contract with design-build capabilities for USCG Civil Engineering Unit, Juneau, Alaska.  This will be a two-phase solicitation process with Phase One being a total small business set-aside.  All responsible small business concerns may submit a proposal in response to the Phase One solicitation.  Upon completion of the Phase One competition, a determination will be made regarding further set-asides under Phase Two.  Work anticipated under this project falls within NAICS Sub-sectors 236 (Construction of Buildings) and 237 (Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction), with a small business size standard of $28.5 million in average annual receipts over the previous three years.  It is anticipated this procurement will result in award of up to five (5) separate IDIQ (task order) construction contracts with design-build capability, primarily for general building type renovation projects, but with some new construction.  Coast Guard facility types are varied, but are predominately housing, office and administrative facilities, aircraft hangars, cutter support team facilities and various types of storage facilities located in marine coastal environments.  The work will be located primarily in south central, southeast and western Alaska, but the scope of the contract will also include Coast Guard construction projects within the states of Washington and Oregon.  Offerors will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on best value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be in effect for one year from the date of award with four one-year renewal options.  Award of contracts is anticipated to take place in late September or early October of 2004 dependent upon availability of funding for the initial project and minimum guarantees.  Funds are not presently available for this project.  No award will be made until funds are available.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the solicitation at any time prior to award.  The total value of all contracts combined will not exceed $40 million over the potential 5-year period.  The minimum guarantee will be $50,000 per contract.  Projects will vary in size from around $100,000 to a maximum size of $3,000,000 per order with most projects in the $250,000 to $750,000 price range.  The awardees will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on future task announcements, which will vary in stage of design completion from approximately 35% to 100%.  Lack of responsiveness to task announcements may result in the government not exercising the renewal option for extending the contract.  Participation in pre-proposal conferences, site visits and proposal preparation for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and will not be directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable design features in accordance with LEED.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  Professionals responsible for stamping drawings, designs, plats, etc. shall be registered in the State where the project is located.  Phase One of the acquisition process will be the narrowing of the competitive field to no more than eight (8) proposers (design-build teams) based on:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Only those proposers selected in Phase One will be allowed to proceed into Phase Two.  In Phase Two, the successful Phase One offerors will submit technical and price proposals for an initial project.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  Offer guarantees/bid bonds will be required for the initial project and future task orders.  The best value proposal will be awarded the initial project and an IDIQ design-build contract with renewal options.  The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s).  A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s).  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the contractor is awarded no task orders over their total contract term.  Subject to the "fair opportunity" ordering provisions of the contract and FAR 16.505(b), Orders under multiple award contracts, future task orders will be competed among the firms that are awarded an IDIQ, with each task order award based on either "best value" or "lowest price technically acceptable" proposal.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition, and are encouraged to register in the Interested Vendors List in FedBizOpps for this project.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  The Phase One solicitation will be available for download in FedBizOpps on or about April 28, 2004.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) will procure a Gas Laboratory Analysis System.  As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  Many of these regulations require sophisticated and adaptable emission measurement systems.  As a result, the EPA National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct low level emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of vehicles and engines. In its role as a National Laboratory for the measurement of regulated emissions, and energy consumption, related to the transportation sector,  NVFEL plays a critical role in the standardization of those measurements.  To support that role, EPA seeks to purchase a combined analytical, data acquisition and database system to establish and document the official concentration, and NIST traceability, of internal gas standards and challenge standards.  EPA has named this system the Gas Laboratory Analysis System. The Gas Laboratory Analysis System shall include specific gas analyzers that provide the highest levels of precision and accuracy available for the intended purpose.  In addition the system will include computer system(s) for analysis control, data acquisition and information processing, equipped with a standard color laser printer, and a bar code reader for rapid identification and verification of gas cylinder numbers.  The computer system(s), using a gas cylinder database provided to it by EPA computers systems, shall facilitate operation of the analysis bench, aid in the quality control of the gas naming process, collect and store measurement data, maintain a database for efficient information retrieval, make new gas cylinder database updates available to EPA computer systems, quality tracking and documentation purposes.  The Gas Laboratory Analysis System shall be located in the existing Gas Laboratory at NVFEL, and shall interface with the existing NVFEL Laboratory Network System (LNS) via an EPA-provided Interface Computer (IFC).  The successful contractor shall be responsible for installation of system. This procurement include options for maintenance on the equipment after the initial warranty has expired.  There will be four (4) twelve month option periods for the maintenance of the equipment.   This procurement will be made using "Best Value" procedures and Full and Open Competition for everything in the SOW including options. The solicitation should be issued by April 15, 2004 on the website listed below.  A "DRAFT" of the proposed Statement of Work for this requirement can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  Interested parties are requested to review the "DRAFT" SOW and provide any comments by March 31, 2004 via fax to Tammy Adams or David Plagge (513) 487-2107 or email at adams.tammy@epa.gov or Plagge.David@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) requires the fabrication, coating, test, and delivery of six (6) large aspheric lenses, designated Collimator Lens 1, Collimator Lens 8, and Camera Lens 1, for the Binospec program.  Binospec is a binocular optical spectrograph that uses a refractive collimator to form a ~200 mm pupil on a diffraction grating, and a refractive camera to image the dispersed light onto a CCD imaging array.  Each of Binospec's identical channels contains 19 lenses, for a total of 38.  The collimator contains nine lenses in three groups, and the camera contains ten lenses in four groups.  Two of the collimator lenses and one of the camera lenses carry aspheric surfaces with 4th, 6th and 8th order terms added to a base (spherical) surface.  SAO needs to procure a total of six aspheric lenses.  Only one surface of each lens is aspheric; the facing surface is polished to a sphere.  The Aspheric Departures for the lenses is 0.5 mm.  SAO wishes to purchase completed lenses with both surfaces polished to our specifications, with a broad band antireflection coating applied to the aspheric surfaces.  Collimator Lens 1 is made from Ohara Glass Type BAL 15Y and has a diameter of 316 mm, a spherical radius of curvature of 209 mm, an edge thickness of 53 mm, and a center thickness of 15 mm.  Collimator Lens 8 is made from Ohara Glass Type BSM 51Y and has a diameter of 286 mm, a spherical radius of curvature of 2,223 mm, an edge thickness of 25 mm, and a center thickness of 17 mm.  Camera Lens 1 is made from Ohara Glass Type BAL 35Y and has a diameter of 358 mm, a spherical radius of curvature of 260 mm, an edge thickness of 49 mm, and a center thickness of 15 mm.  SAO will provide the lens blanks.  Scratch/Dig is 60/40.  Surface Finish is better than 30 Angstroms RMS.  We expect that each aspheric lens will be tested in transmission, using a spherical reference and a holographic null lens, supplemented by surface roughness measurements.  In addition, we prefer that profilometer scans be made of the aspherical surfaces to independently verify that the specified aspheric shape is achieved.  For Surface Figure, the single-pass wavefront deviation from nominal shall be less than 0.05 waves RMS (reference wavelength 6328 Angstroms) over the entire clear aperture.  On scales of 1 mm and less, the surface roughness shall be less than 20 Angstroms RMS.  On any scale up the full lens aperture, the RMS slope errors shall be less than 5x10-6 radians.  Prospective vendors shall specify how these surface roughness and slope error measurements will be made.  A firm-fixed price contract for this procurement is contemplated.  Offers will be evaluated on price, technical proposal, past performance, and ability to meet the schedule.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about 1 April 2004 with an anticipated proposal due date on or about 1 May 2004.  The firm date for receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  The anticipated award date is on or about 1 June 2004.  The anticipated delivery date for the six lenses will be twelve months after award of the contract.  Delivery is f.o.b. destination, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Only written, fax, or email requests for a solicitation received directly from the requester are acceptable.  No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and size standard are 333314 and 500 Employees, respectively.   All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency.  This procurement will be conducted using the methods described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items.

<ARCHDATE>05022004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Tharp, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2092
<DESC>NAICS Code: 611310   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) for review and analysis of Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicle (HDDV) Emissions in the Atlanta, Georgia Metropolitan Area in accordance with the EPA Mobile Emissions Assessment System for Urban and Regional Evaluation (MEASURE) model under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement for the ORD/APPCD will utilize FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   The importance of heavy-duty vehicle emissions, especially in urban areas, is acknowledged;  however, there is a serious lack-of-knowledge with respect to the spatial and temporal operating characteristics of heavy-duty vehicles.  There are serious deficiencies in the "real-world" fleet mix that operates on roadways as well as their engine and transmission characteristics; and their cargo  weight characteristics.  As a consequence of the seriousness of the large role that HDDV emissions play in non-attainments areas, such as Atlanta, techniques are being evaluated to reduce HDDV emissions.  Accurate modeling and implementation of effective emission control strategies requires  knowledge of not only how these vehicles are operated, but also how HDDV fleet turnover impacts emissions.  The purpose of this study is to validate the EPA MEASURE model, determine its strengths and weaknesses, and propose improvements to the model.  The information gathered from this review and  analysis will be used to develop more effective HDDV emission reduction strategies.  This procurement is a continuation of Cooperative Agreements and a Purchase Order with Georgia Tech to assist EPA in development of the model.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm  believing itself capable of providing the required review and analysis may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of delivering this analysis.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the  proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.   Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2109 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Minority Health, (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Washington, DC. 
Purpose:
To plan, conduct, and convene the health workshops of the 75th Annual LULAC National Conference & Exposition, Celebrating Our Legacy: Defining Our Future.  As the premier Hispanic conference, it will bring together top leaders from government, business, and the Hispanic community from across the Nation to share their recommendations on determining ways to improve the quality of life of Hispanic Americans.  The purpose of this conference is to better understand the issues that affect Hispanic communities the most, from immigration reform and education to healthcare and civil rights.  The LULAC National Conference will feature a Health Fair with free health screenings and health workshops that will inform and educate conference participants of the major health issues affecting Hispanics.  Additionally, participants will learn the different channels of accessing healthcare from local and federal perspectives. 
Understanding the major issues confronting Hispanics is critical because at about 13 percent of the U.S. population, Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in the country and it’s estimated that by the year 2050, nearly one in four of U.S. Americans will be Hispanic.  Hispanics report the highest uninsured rate among all racial and ethnic groups and with no regular source of care, Hispanics have become less likely than whites or African Americans to receive important preventive services, specifically for chronic diseases.  The risk of type II diabetes for Hispanics is almost twice that for non-Hispanic whites.  Asthma rates for Latino children are 2.5 times higher than those for non-Hispanic white children.  Approximately 65 percent of Latinos and 57 percent of Latinas over the age of 18 are overweight.  And in addition to higher rates of chronic disease, Latinos report lower screening rates than whites for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.  It is apparent that healthcare is a major issue that needs critical attention; however, education is also at the forefront of issues that need further discussion.  
Statistics show that nearly half of Hispanics leave school by the eighth grade and less than 
13 percent go on to receive their bachelor’s degrees.  Hispanics represent less than 4 percent of physicians and about 9 percent of registered nurses in the U.S. (US Census, 2000).  Hispanics currently represent 3.2 percent of HHS permanent workforce and 8.1 percent of the Civilian Labor Force.  Given the most recent Census Bureau population projection for Hispanics, the need to address employment among Hispanics is critical.  Increasing training programs aimed toward improving the geographic distribution and racial and ethnic diversity of the healthcare workforce is essential for improving the labor force of Hispanics.  
The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) was created in 1929 in Corpus Christi, Texas.  It is the Nation’s oldest and largest Hispanic organization with members organized into more than 700 LULAC Councils in virtually every state in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.  With a rich history of advocacy in civil rights, education, economic development, immigration, and healthcare, LULAC is uniquely positioned to plan and organize the national conference and exposition.  LULAC has become an important influence in national policymaking with a permanent national office in Washington, DC and continues to address those issues that impact the lives of Hispanic Americans.  

LULAC is the cornerstone of some of the most successful Hispanic national organizations. LULAC formed The American GI Forum (AGIF) to address the rights of Hispanic veterans and SER - Jobs for Progress, Inc., which has trained and found jobs for thousands of Hispanic Americans.  

THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302. 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Design and related considerations also include erosion control (minimizing velocity in ditches/providing ditch turnouts/establishment of native grasses/etc)/architectural hardware/electronic communications/environmental regulatory considerations includ ing State of Louisiana regulated stormwater pollution prevention plans/environmental survey of facilities to be demolished (asbestos/lead based paint/etc)/subsurface geotechnical investigation/testing and limited unexploded ordnance (UXO) site avoidance by  UXO-qualified personnel as necessary for site investigations.  Design must also satisfy required gunnery tables and achieve line of sight from firing positions to targets which impacts range layout and grading.  Design documents will be prepared using Eng lish units of measure.  Project deliverables may include engineering studies (life cycle costs/SPiRiT evaluation and ratings/energy budgets)/environmental surveys/CADD (Bentley Microstation (BMS)) plans/specifications prepared utilizing Specsintact/constru ction cost estimates prepared utilizing M-CACES/design analysis and weekly status report; all in hard copy and as electronic files.  Electronic files are required to be provided on compact disk (CD-ROM).  Plan electronic files include CADD files/CAL raster  files, and an index of CADD and CAL files in an Excel-compatible spreadsheet.  CADD design is not required to be performed in BMS and may be converted to BMS for the final submittal.  The A-E is responsible for a complete and seamless CADD conversion to B MS.  This agency utilizes a paperless construction bidding process and production of acceptable CADD/Specsintact/pdf and cal files is critical to that process.  Specification electronic files include the required Specsintact (Government-furnished (GF) soft ware) files as well as pdf files used in the paperless bidding process.  The required construction cost estimate electronic files include pdf as well as M-CACES files.  The design analysis may also be required to be submitted as a pdf file and in hard copy .

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide for comment the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) Sections (I through M) for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Security, Planning, and Integrated Resources for Information Technology (SPIRIT) Project.  NOTES: The following NAICS codes apply to this requirement: 541511, 541512, 541513, and 541519 with a $21M size standard for all.  Also, contractors are advised that Section J, Attachment 1, SPIRIT Draft RFP Section B Pricing Sheets for Functional Area MAP, ISE, SOM, ISS have been re-named and revised to include instructions, formulas for cost input, and spreadsheets for the Sample Task Scenario.  1) All comments must be submitted electronically to BOTH the SPIRIT Contracting Officer, Brenda Peterson, at bpeterson@comdt.uscg.mil and the SPIRIT Program Manager, Dani Wildason, at dwildason@comdt.uscg.mil.  2) All comments must be received by midnight, April 5, 2004.  3) All comments received will be adjudicated and considered for inclusion into the final RFP.  4) As with comments for Section B-H, we do not anticipate issuing a separate FedBizOpps posting in response to the consolidated comments received, nor will we be responding to individual comments.  We may determine, however, that certain aspects of the RFP require further clarification upon adjudication of the comments.  As necessary, such clarifications will be posted in FedBizOpps 5) Potential Offerors in the 8(a) tiers are advised that the DHS SPIRIT 8(a) General Offering and Agreement (which was recently revised to reflect changes in the term of the contracts) has not yet been signed by the SBA.  It is anticipated that SBA acceptance will occur prior to release of the final RFP.  6) Contractors are advised that the general contract structure and strategy will not be altered.  7) We plan to release the final RFP in late May 2004 with awards planned for 1st Quarter FY05.  8) It is our intent to leave the final RFP open for 30 days.  As such, it is to the benefit of all potential offerors to ensure that all comments are submitted to us by the cut-off date identified in the draft RFP so that they may be adjudicated and considered for incorporation into the final RFP.  NOTE:  Due to overwhelming interest in this requirement, no phone inquiries, e-mails or requests to meet “one-on-one” will be answered.  Please ensure you are utilizing the FedBizOpps auto-notification feature to receive all updates to this effort.

Re-Opened:  All small businesses who did not previously respond to this announcement and can perform 51% of this effort are strongly encouraged to provide a capability package. Capable sources are sought to satisfy requirements for Air Force Disaster Recovery Systems at operational commands’ DoD Intelligence Community sites for the General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP). This program will permit disaster recovery plans to be implemented at each command encompassing processes and procedures that address system design, development, integration, testing and evaluation for the purposes of remote (nominal 100+ miles) replication of digital mission critical and mission essential GDIP funded data, servers and applications to prevent their loss should a disaster occur.  Site requirements will be analyzed through systems analysis and tradeoff studies, architecture analysis and design, and system feasibility/impact studies to evaluate candidate subsystems for inclusion in customized Disaster Recovery (DR) Systems augmenting existing infrastructures. System Architectures for specific sites will be developed, including proposed hardware and software, adapted to the sites’ unique architectures. Site visits will be made, as necessary, to conduct surveys of site requirements, existing infrastructure and plans. Detailed implementation plans will be developed to document approved configurations and design and to guide the implementation, installation, initial data load, test and initial operating capability for each site. Assistance will be provided to the sites for security accreditation purposes following certification testing.  An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (I.D.I.Q,) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) - Completion type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of forty-eight (48) months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is $48,000,000.00. The prime contractor, system integrators, and subcontractors for this contract must have Top Secret SCI security clearances. Responses to this sources sought are requested from small businesses and will be used for market research purposes and possible set-aside. Should the determination be made to select this as a small business set-aside, another notice will be posted reflecting such.

(6) Are there any other factors concerning your company's ability to perform the upcoming effort that the Air Force should consider? Respondents are requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails of intent to the Contract Specialist should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.

<DESC>The following synopsis is corrected to change the year for receipt of cabability statements.  Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.

PRDA 02-02-IFKA, CONTACT: Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, (315) 330-4777, email, Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil.  AFRL/IFEA Program Manager, Mr. Robert E. Macior, (315) 330-2480, email: Robert.Macior@rl.af.mil; Technical Point of Contact: Jon Jones, (315) 330- 1665, e-mail, Jon.Jones@rl.af.mil, 315-330-1665; Mark Pronobis, (315) 330- 3072, email, Mark.Pronobis@rl.af.mil.    Introduction: The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and development for innovative concepts and techniques to Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage and Assess (F2T2EA) stationary and moving surface targets.   Under the Targets-Under-Trees (TUT) program, the Information (IF) Directorate is partnered with three other AFRL Directorates, including the Sensors (SN) Directorate and Human Effectiveness (HE) Directorate at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) and the Munitions (MN) Directorate at Eglin AFB. The TUT program management team is led by AFRL/SNAA with deputy program managers from AFRL/IFEA and AFRL/SNRR and will be executed with coordinated procurements from four AFRL Directorates: SN, IF, MN, and HE.  The principal solicitations are those from AFRL/SN, entitled "Targets Under Trees (TUT) Family of Systems and Supporting Technologies" and this solicitation from AFRL/IF.    The AFRL/SN solicitation is concerned with the overall TUT systems engineering, development for the Foliage-Penetrating (FOPEN) radar, its associated technologies and other support functions, including modeling and simulation. The weapon fuze technology development is being conducted through AFRL/MN, whereas, the human-system interface technology development and design is being conducted by AFRL/HE. This AFRL/IF solicitation is concerned with the fusion of intelligence data from multiple ISR sensors to find, fix and track mobile ground targets in the open and hide. This includes an extensible system architecture to accommodate intelligence data and advanced fusion algorithms, data base integration including geo-registration, and reasoning technologies to reduce target location errors and identification uncertainties.   The desired system will produce target quality location, identification and kinematics.  This AFRL/IF solicitation addresses Intelligence Fusion and its supporting technologies. The TUT program is chartered to develop a capability for performing the Find, Fix and Engage portions of the kill chain process on targets employing concealment with camouflage and foliage. The TUT concept is to find and identify concealed mobile ground vehicles using multi-sensor fusion and Very High Frequency (VHF) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) employing Change Detection techniques. The targets will be identified by associating the detections with fused intelligence information products and held at risk while in hide with upgraded foliage penetrating munitions. The TUT program will employ and exploit existing technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a roadmap of continued spiral development over the three - year program. The developments required to meet the TUT objectives involve FOPEN radar with Change Detection, information fusion, geo-registration, terrain characterization, weapons fuze and human-system interface technologies.  In addition to direct technology developments, the TUT program will support other complementary activities including, test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, data collection and management, and a distributed collaborative engineering environment.   Finally, an overall system engineering effort will assist the Government in managing the distribution of functionality and performance requirements across the contributing technologies.   The TUT program is sponsored by the Air Force Aerospace Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Center (AC2ISRC). Objective:  The level of complexity addressed by this PRDA varies from stationary and moving targets in open environments to targets that are partially to fully obscured by foliage and camouflage. However, the TUT Intelligence Fusion System (TUT IFS) focuses on the ability to locate and identify targets employing concealment with camouflage or foliage, while minimizing false alarms and the impact of terrain obscuration and platform outages. The problem being addressed by this procurement is the development of an overall TUT IFS architecture and the interface and integration of specific contributing systems. The TUT IFS will fuse various types of intelligence information to produce actionable information including targetable locations and identification for mobile ground vehicles in hide. The developed system will be transitionable to the Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and/or as applicable, the Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental (CAOC-X). Technical Background:  The Air Force Research Laboratory Fusion Technology Branch is developing an open, distributed, object-oriented architecture for information fusion under their Adaptive Sensor Fusion (ASF) program.  This program includes support for multiple interoperable fusion components and a public Application Programmer's Interface (API) that is suitable for inserting new fusion components into the system. Fusion component interoperability is based on a shared description of the battlespace and shared data exchange and persistence mechanisms. Through the implementation of a common interface and a common battlespace ontology, new and legacy fusion engines and capabilities can be encapsulated and become interoperable components within a common architecture. Given this stable environment for test and development, the performance of legacy and new fusion engines can be rapidly inserted, evaluated and consistently quantified.  PRDA Organization: The overall objective of this PRDA is to develop, integrate, demonstrate and transition system technologies required for locating, tracking and identifying targets in both open and obscured environments. The original PRDA was presented in two sections.    The first section addressed proposal requests for the Intelligence Fusion System Integrator (IFSI) for the TUT IFS, and has been completed.  Therefore, the IFSI portion published in the synopsis on 26 Oct 2001 has been deleted from this reannouncemnet.  The second section, Multi-Intelligence (Multi-INT) Fusion for TCTs (MIFT), is still ongoing.  For this section, AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative solutions to the Find, Fix and Track portions of the TUT kill chain.    The IFSI contractor(s) are not precluded from submitting White Papers. It is expected that within the technical requirements for this PRDA, there will be additional technologies that need to be addressed.  As part of the AFRL Fusion program addressing MIFT, technologies will be addressed leading to a more robust fusion system.    These technologies will be considered for inclusion into the IFSI effort as the technologies are matured.   In order to provide funding for development of promising technologies, AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that address the following specific areas and must be implemented as an ASF component: (1) reasoning technologies that establish target attributes and ID; (2) optimization of Multi-INT fusion techniques; (3) identification of stationary and moving targets employing sensor cueing and cross-cueing; (4) robust techniques that provide adequate target identification for continuous tracking in open and obscured environments; (5) advanced fusion and reasoning techniques that reduce target location error and ID uncertaintanty; and (6) other data fusion technologies relevant to solving the TUT problem, such as; Video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, MASINT (seismic, acoustic, magnetic), HUMINT.    Awards: Multiple awards for the MIFT initiative are anticipated.    The principal funding of the White Papers and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 2Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed.   Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 32 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $1,000,000, per award. Total funding for the MIFT portion of this PRDA is approximately, $15.4M. AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA.  Technical solutions should emphasize the use of open systems that accommodate distributed, modular, and extensible approaches.    Deliverables will be technical reports, robust software applications that utilize ASF Core Services and demonstrations with levels of maturity adequate to transition to the IFSI and be integrated into the TUT IFS architecture. Integration and demonstration utilizing the AFRL Fusion Laboratory at the Rome Research Site is required under this PRDA. Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) will be required with the IFSI, AFRL Fusion Laboratory in-house contractors and others, as required.    Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the White Papers. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.    Work to be performed will require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability.    Also, personnel identified for assignment must be cleared for access to SECRET information, at the time of award.    However, a TOP SECRET facility clearance and key personnel cleared for access to SI/TK information prior to award may be required dependent upon the work to be performed and information utilized. A principal investigator clause may be required on these efforts.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION FOR MIFT. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.    Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the Multi-Intelligence Fusion for TCTs portion of this PRDA to AFRL/IFEA, ATTN: Robert Macior, Ref. PRDA 02-02-IFKA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114 no earlier than 17 December 2001. White Papers are limited to a total page count of five (5) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.    White Papers must contain a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology. White Papers will be accepted until 30 Sept 2005. It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year to maximize the possibility of award. However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year.    The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual White Paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other White Papers submitted under the announcement.    Additional White Paper preparation instructions may be found at:    http://www.rl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html      Government Furnished Information/Equipment (GFI/GFE): Information on ASF will be provided by the government to the IFSI and MIFT contractors for use under this program. The necessary hardware required for the software integration into the AFRL Fusion Facility and targeted transition facility will be provided as Base Support.    However, the IFSI and MIFT contractors shall be required to provide hardware at their own facility for architecture development and integration during the contract period-of-performance.    This hardware shall be compatible with the targeted facilities. No GFE will be provided to the IFSI or MIFT contractors for development use in their facility. The IFSI offerors shall specify, and provide if awarded, any reference image or display background required for the geo-registration/time synchronization for the fusion of the multi-spectral data.

More Information can be requested from Norma Webb-Green, Contract Specialist, email norma.webbgreen@us.army.mil  phone 309 782-8605.  The basic component of the M142 Firing Device is a mechanical switch  designed for mechanical actuation(to initiate the explosive)by pressure, pull, pressure release or tension release.  In addition to it's four-mode capability, the M142 can be used to ignite either a blasting cap (as in other firing devices) or time blasti ng fuse for setting a short delay type booby trap.

A TRIPWIRE 50 feet of copper wire wound on a cardboard spool.  an olive drab coat of paint over the wire prevents if from accidentally unwinding and aids concealment.  it is used in the tension release mode and in the pull mode.  A TENS ION RELEASE attachment of specially formed stainless steel wire that has a spring type action.  In the tension release mode, the attachment holds the tripwire under tension that , in turn, maintains the firing device in a constantly armed position. Actuati on is initiated when the taut tripwire is cut which permits the sear plate to release the firing pin.  A COUPLING BODY, a cylindrical plastic assembly that contains the explosive initiating element, an M42 primer, but no blasting cap. The user installs the  cap.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for providing information technology (IT) and related support services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The contractor will be responsible for providing program management and for assuming a partnership role with the Government in providing technical solutions and in securing and retaining business.  Requirements are defined further in the contract Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Interested parties are encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page. This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of â€œBest Value to the FAAâ€.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519, Other Computer Related Services - $21/million will be used for this acquisition.  Interested vendors that have experience in IT Support Services are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement/SIR1.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement/SIR1. The FAA is committed to the socio-economic goals of the Department of Transportation and the Agency for Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman-owned, and Service-Disabled Veteran business arrangements.  Therefore, contractor demonstration of commitment to these goals enters into the FAAâ€™s selection of the submittal representing the overall best value for those services identified and enumerated in the PWS.  It is highly desirable that all offerors recognize and demonstrate their commitment to these goals through their respective subcontracting and/or teaming arrangement(s).  Close monitoring of the accomplishment of the goals will be an important post-award activity.  The vendor will be expected to make a good faith effort to achieve the following subcontracting goals: Percentage of Total Contract Value 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SB				26%* 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SDB				10% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to WOB				 5% 			Teaming/Subcontracts to SD/VOB			 1% 			*The 26% figure represents the entire small business subcontracting program goal. Subcontracting goals will be an evaluated factor in Phase 2 of the procurement process. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  The initial phase involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR. Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendorâ€™s eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendorâ€™s eligibility pursuant to this SIR.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendorâ€™s information.  Any statement included in a vendorâ€™s response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2â€x11â€, printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendorâ€™s response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility. SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendorâ€™s submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendorâ€™s eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.

Each block in the matrix will be filled in with two letters or it will remain empty to indicate no experience is that area.  The first letter will be either â€œPâ€ or â€œS,â€ to denote that the experience was gained as either a â€œPrime Contractorâ€ or as a â€œSubcontractor.â€  The second letter will be either â€œHâ€, â€œMâ€, or â€œLâ€, to denote a â€œHighâ€, â€œMediumâ€, or â€œLowâ€ relevance assessment by the contractor to that of the IT support services effort.

<DESC>The ICBM System Program Office (SPO) under the Minuteman Missile Depot Maintenance Program intends to establish a contract with Lockheed Martin Corporation, Space Systems to conduct analysis and research for identifying suitable substitutions to critical sub-assemblies on the Low Frequency Instrumentation Console (LFIC)/Radio Frequency Instrumentation Console (RFIC).  This service is in support of an on-going Sustainment to the MK2A and MK21 Arming & Fusing Assembly (AFA) to ensure reliable fuses are deployed to the operational missile wings.

The LFIC is a 1970s vintage test console and is critical to the Aging & Surveillance (A&S) and other service life testing as well as production testing for both the MK12A and MK21 AFA, while the RFIC performs the necessary radio frequency testing of the MK12A Radar, Microwave and MK21 Radar.  

Suitable technical data, government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application.  Data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in the Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.  

Lockheed Martin was the original design agent for the LFI/RFI consoles.  They possess the knowledge and understanding of the equipment and the AFA maintenance expertise, technical data and facilities to successfully perform the required services.  They possess the ability to ensure integration of hardware and all software codes with negligible impact to the AFA program.  Additionally, the outcome will ensure all consoles at Hill AFB and Lockheed Martin are in the same configuration which will ensure seamless on-going support the AFA.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firm(s) listed.  

Any potential contractors are requested to submit unclassified response within 15 working days after publication of this notice to Janice Hansen/LMKA/ 6014 Dogwood Ave, Bldg 1258, Hill AFB, Utah 84045-5816, Phone: (80) 775-2280 email: Janice.hansen@hill.af.mil or Sandy Thurston

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-F61003
<RESPDATE>032804
<ARCHDATE>04122004
<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Ms. Karen F. Strauss under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and Note 22.  

BACKGROUND: 

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) (Public Law 103-417) was signed into law on October 25, 1994.  DSHEA, among other things, amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by adding section 402(g) (21 U.S.C. 342(g)) that gives the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  by delegation the authority to prescribe current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements.  FDA proposed CGMP regulations for dietary ingredients and dietary supplements on March 13, 2003, with a 90-day public comment period.  The public comment period was extended 60-days and closed on August 11, 2003.  The agency received over 400 comment letters totaling over 1600 pages.
 
Publishing a dietary ingredient and dietary supplement CGMP final rule during December 2004 is a high-priority activity for the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services.  A Final Rule will establish the minimum CGMPs necessary to ensure that activities related to manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients or dietary supplements are conducted in a manner that will not adulterate and misbrand such dietary ingredients or dietary supplements.     

SCOPE OF WORK:  

The Contractor shall attend meetings as needed to discuss the Final Rule, assist the Project Lead to determine who responds to which comments and review the work of other preamble and codified drafters.  The Contractor's role shall include the following activities:

1) Works closely with the Lead Rule Writer (LRW) throughout this project
2) Reviews comments to preamble and codified as assigned
3) Assists the LRW in determining who drafts response to which comments and  reviews and comments on draft responses
4) Assists in identifying issues that must be responded to in the Preamble of the Final Rule
5) Identifies dietary supplement CGMP outside experts for Special Government Employee (SGE) status
6) Helps develop questions with input from scientific consultants for SGE response
7) Attends meetings (as necessary) with appropriate staff including LRW, Decision Maker, Economists, Scientific Consultants, and Senior Advisors
8) Meets with Center Director, Decision Maker, Senior Advisors, and LRW as needed to bring closure to unresolved policy issues regarding Final Rule and to ensure that decisions are incorporated in the Final Rule
9) Helps develop revised codified
10) Attends meetings as needed to discuss Final Rule
11) Assists LRW in reviewing clearance comments and determining who responds to which comments.  

FDA/CFSAN/ONPLDS will provide the following: 
1) office space in the Wiley Building, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, College Park, MD 20740
2) a desk PC and printer, access to the FDA intranet, 
3) remote access Dell Latitude laptop computer, and remote access to the FDA intranet

The Contractor shall provide ISP connectivity.  

LEVEL OF EFFORT AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE 

Eleven (11) month period of performance.  The Contractor effort shall not exceed 10 hours per week, 43 hours per month, and 520 hours during the period of performance.  

The Contractor shall be present at the CFSAN Wiley Building or FDA Parklawn Building up to 5 hours per week.  

DELIVERABLES 

The contractor shall assist in revising the codified by a time established by CFSAN/FDA, contingent on and with the collaborative effort of the LRW and others in FDA/CFSAN identified by the Project Officer.

The contractor shall assist in revising the preamble by a time established by CFSAN/FDA, contingent on and with the collaborative effort of the Project Officer and others in FDA/CFSAN identified by the Project Officer.  
 
JUSTIFICATION 

Publishing a dietary ingredient and dietary supplement CGMP final rule during fiscal year 2005 is a high-priority activity for the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services.  A Final Rule will establish the minimum CGMPs necessary to ensure that activities related to manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients or dietary supplements are conducted in a manner that will not adulterate and misbrand such dietary ingredients or dietary supplements. 

The Final Rule developed under this requirement will permit the requesting organization to meet the dietary supplement regulatory goals of the FDA for publishing a Final Rule in December 2004.

Ms. Karen Strauss was with the Department of Health and Humans Services for 19 years with six years at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) FDA from 12/1997 to 1/2004.  Ms. Strauss holds a M.S. Degree in Food Science and Nutrition.  While at the FDA she was responsible for drafting the Current Good Manufacturing Practices in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Dietary Ingredients and Dietary Supplements Proposed Rule.

Ms. Strauss' unique understanding and thorough knowledge of the operations of CFSAN in the area of dietary supplement CGMP regulation will enable her to provide a critical leadership role.  Ms. Strauss' experience in developing the proposed rule is crucial to FDA in developing the Final Rule.

To our knowledge, Karen Strauss is the only person with the experience and knowledge of the Current Good Manufacturing Practices in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Dietary Ingredients and Dietary Supplements Proposed Rule.   This notice is being made under the authority of FAR 5.201 and the FDA will consider any other expressions of interest and/or bids/proposals received.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is requesting information from industry regarding its capability in meeting the following requirement---On-Demand Commercial Wideband Communications Systems.---Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF I) demonstrated the need for a tactical, satellite-based system which could provide wide bandwidth satellite system access to Marine Corps classified and unclassified networks. During OIF I, the operational network (SIPRNET) took precedence over the unclassified network (NIPRNET) resulting in limited bandwidth available for the combat support services (CSS) units tasked with providing fast, flexible logistics to the Marine Forces in theater---As contemplated, the system should provide on-demand, global wideband satellite access to Marine Corps classified and unclassified networks, and should include 5 Hubs (2Mbps upload / 4 Mbps download), with each hub capable of servicing a minimum of 4 spokes. The system should also include 20 spokes with 1 Mbps upload / 2 Mbps download OPTIMUM), and 512k upload / 1 Mbps download MINIMUM.---At a minimum, the system should be capable of handling such traffic as voice, SMTP Email, Internet searching, FTP, and text files---The system should require minimal operator training (communications background not required - identify education level and length of training required), and should be capable of rapid set-up and tear down (identify time required).---Satellite terminals should be auto-acquiring, auto-transmitting VSAT antennas that are certified for unmanned operation.---Must include a plan for deployed support  personnel to help install, operate, and maintain the proposed system, and to train MEF operators. Plan for the network/security management node to be located with the I MEF Headquarters.---MARCORSYSCOM contemplates issuance of a Request For Proposals (RFP) to meet this need. However, this request for information (RFI) does not constitute an RFP, and no funding is available for costs incurred by companies choosing to submit capability statements under this RFI. Approximately 15 systems may be required, and delivery is contemplated 6 weeks after any contract awards made as a result of the subsequent RFP. Interested parties are invited to submit as appropriate: statements of capability, including the extent to which the requirement can be met using commercial items and/or non-developmental items; commercial brochures or catalogs with pricing if available; past performance information demonstrating recent, similar efforts; existing contract vehicles [such as Federal Supply Schedules (FSS)]. Responses shall be sent to: MARCORSYSCOM CT, ATTN: Ms Catherine Richmond, 2200 Lester St, Quantico VA, 22134.  (703-432-4280)

<DESC>Y-SOURCES SOUGHT for Nationwide Recruiting Centers Real Property Security Upgrade Program NAICS Codes:  236220 (Construction) and 541690 (Security Consulting Services) B-SOURCES SOUGHT for Nationwide Recruiting Centers Real Property Security Upgrade Program NAICS Codes:  541690 (Security Consulting Services) and 236220 (Construction)  Description: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineering Contracting Agency, in conjunction with the U.S. Corps of Engineers Protective Design Center (USACE PDC), and the Joint Recruiting Facilities Committee (JRFC), are looking for potential sources to help with management and  implementation of security upgrades to multiple Recruiting Center offices located in locations across the United States including Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.  The USACE PDC was tasked by the JRFC to provide a security and vu lnerability assessment (VA) of approximately 6,000 military recruiting offices in over 2,500 different locations.  Based on this VA, real property upgrades were identified to improve human protection and survivability from potential terrorist or criminal t hreats.  The threats include tactics that could harm the recruiting service personnel, the facilities, and the environment.  Attacks could include a variety of tactics including ballistics as well as the use of chemical, radiological, and biological (CRB) agents.  This proposed project is to implement the real property upgrades selected by the JRFC.  The estimated quantities for each of the real property upgrades are based on statistical data for the sites surveyed (10% of the total number of recruiting sta tions were visited).  The contractor will provide all labor, materials, and services as necessary for the installation, testing, proveout and acceptance of the assigned tasks, to include site visits, identification of facility specific requirements, identi fying and obtaining all necessary permits, material and equipment selection, purchase and installation, quality assurance, and preparation of documentation for the activities performed at each location.  Work may include, but is not limited to: 1) Install basement, crawl space, and roof access controls; 2) Close/secure mail slots; 3) Install outside lighting; 4) Install entry bell/chime, window blinds, and Fragmentation Retention Film (FRF) on windows; 5) Upgrade/replace exterior door locks; 6) Install fire  extinguishers, smoke alarms, exit lighting and emergency lighting; 7) Install rolling metal shutters; 8) Install main access controls, including remote actuated locking device, local video monitor, and magnetic locking system; and 9) Install remote monito red alarm system.  The contractor shall train their personnel on how to conduct quality oversight and surveillance of the security upgrades.  The training shall include an overview of the coordination communication between all project personnel and to defi ne the quality control and quality control requirements for acceptance and reporting of all fieldwork.  USACE project management, engineering and real estate personnel shall also attend the training. These actions are part of a homeland security initiative  to provide force protection for the recruiting center personnel operating in the public sector all across the country.  This also provides a means to reduce the likelihood and severity of environmental impact due to CRB attack on recruiting offices.  Due to the nature of this project, the contractor will be required to submit a signed Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA), which prevents the contractor from disclosing any information or details concerning the locations, types and quantities of installed security items without the written consent of the Contracting Officer.    The estimated value of this Cost Reimbursement acquisition is $14,500,000/ (a two-year base and one three-year option for a total contract period of five years).  The size standards to determ ine small business for this project is:  236220 Ã¢Â €Â“ Construction ($28,500,000).  Any contractor wishing to provide services that are consistent with the above descriptions and requirements must provide demonstrated and documented past performance and qualifications; information requested must include, a s a minimum: 1) Business size and type [copy of applicable small business certifications (Section 8(a) and HubZone only)]; 2) A listing of available technical expertise (and abbreviated resumes) available to execute this contract; 3) Description and locati on of projects similar to Recruiting Centers Security Upgrade (Nationwide).

<SUBJECT>Open Solicitation for The Materials Disposition Basic Ordering Agreement
<DESC>Introduction: The Government desires to divest itself of surplus Material such as scrap metal, equipment, vehicles, etc., that cannot be made available to the general public.  The Material is currently located at sites across the Government complex.  The Material is believed to have some value to certain commercial enterprises, therefore, the Material is not considered waste.  The Material meets the definition of personal property as stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Some of the Material may be radioactively contaminated and regulated under The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended. Interested firms should check the ORO Procurement Website for more information at http://www.oro.doe.gov/procurement/cur_sol.html Background: The federal government and in particular the U.S. Department of Energy Complex has an indeterminate amount of potentially contaminated radioactive Material that could be recycled, reused or buried.  The Material is in the form of small to large pieces of metal, structural steel, equipment and vehicles.  The Material may be in scrap piles, outside locations and stored in containers, and/or it may be located within underutilized or abandoned facilities. In some cases the Material may be attached and/or part of the building in which they are located. Scope: General ? The Contractor shall disposition the Material by decontamination, sorting, segregating, or by other means, processing the Material at the Contractor?s facility(ies).  The requirements shall be specified in each order.  Hereafter referred to as ?order(s)?.  The order may include removal, characterization, packaging, and transportation to the Contractor?s facility. Security ? The requiring organization shall make the determination if the Material has security concerns.  If the Material to be dispositioned requires special handling or processing due to classification, Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI), or Export Controlled Information (ECI) specific requirements shall be detailed within the individual orders.  It is anticipated that such requirements will be minimal, but where applicable shall likely require certified destruction or reconfiguration of the affected Material. Where required, methods of destruction or reconfiguration may be proposed by the contractor for approval by the organization issuing the order. Contractors may not be able to perform those orders requiring security clearances until such clearances are obtained. Radioactive Property - When the Material subject to transfer is radioactively or potentially contaminated the contractor shall comply with federal requirements for all activities performed at that site.  It is anticipated only minimal decontamination processing to expedite handling, loading, and transporting of the Material will be permitted at the federal work site. Material located at the contractor?s facilities shall be managed and regulated in accordance with the terms and conditions of its NRC or NRC Agreement State license. Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H) and Quality Assurance (QA) - The ES&H and QA requirements will likely vary with each order depending on what work (if any) will be performed on the government?s site.  If the order requires dismantling for parts or equipment on a government site there would likely be additional ES&H and QA requirements.  The organization issuing the order shall be required to detail the ES&H and QA requirements associated with a given order. Onsite Actions, Packaging, and Transportation - For some tasks, the contractor shall be responsible for removal of the Material from designated facilities and/or storage areas.  Onsite actions shall be defined by each order.  The requiring organization shall provide the best information available on the description, characterization, and history of the Material.  The removal and transportation of the Material by the Contractor shall be done in compliance with all applicable State, Federal, and local laws and regulations. Title and Possession ? The government?s intent is to transfer title to all the Material at some point in the disposition process. The point of title transfer and possession shall be clearly defined in each order. Possession shall occur no later than at the point of receipt at the Contractor?s facility. If there are no security concerns with the material under an order, title transfer will likely be concurrent. If the Material has security concerns the title will transfer after the security concerns are resolved and prior to any unrestricted release of Material or final disposition of the Material. Applicable Directives: 1. The Contractor shall maintain all required licenses/permits to conduct the scope of each applicable task, including shipping, storage, handling and waste disposal. 2. The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with federal, state, and local rules, regulations and standards and within the limits of the Contractor?s permit or license. 3. The Contractor shall comply with quality assurance requirements as established by Nuclear Quality Assurance manual (NQA-1), Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities. 4. Any other applicable organization directives (e.g. DOE Orders and/or Site-specific procedures) shall be specified in each order. Performance Requirements: Specific performance requirements shall be delineated for each order. General Requirements -The Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, National Center of Excellence for Metals Recycle (NMR) is the sponsor of this BOA. NMR reserves the right to conduct annual quality assurance audits to the requirements of the Contractor?s NRC or NRC Agreement State license.  All organizations that issue orders under this BOA will rely on the NMR annual audits and shall not conduct their own.  If NMR finds major concerns during an audit, the Contractor shall not be allowed to participate in the competition for any orders until the finding is corrected and approved by NMR.  NMR, or a contractor for NMR, may also conduct surveillance. 1. The Contractor shall have the legal authority to possess and process radioactive materials, such as a NRC license or NRC Agreement State radioactive material license. 2. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal and State requirements including EPA, OSHA, DOT and NRC/NRC Agreement State regulations. The Contractor shall notify DOE if any of their licenses or permits has expired, been revoked, or is under any other action by regulators that shall not allow the Contractor to accept Material for processing. 3. The Contractor shall provide DOE the results of regulatory audits conducted, or Notices of Violations issued by regulators. 4. The Contractor shall have health and safety programs that meet the requirements of their licenses or permits to handle Material in the specific order. Deliverables For each order the Contractor shall provide an annual Mass Balance Report in accordance with the attached format delineating the Material dispositioned under that order to the BOA Administrator listed in Article 3. One copy shall also be provided to the activity or site issuing the order. Annual Mass Balance Reports shall be due on February 1st for the previous year. Additional deliverables may be specified in each order.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Portable Scanners
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures for 600 Visioneer XP100 Portable Scanners with USB and Serial Interface Kit – Part #SXP1001-DB. OCC has a number of Visioneer scanners and is looking for standardization both as it applies to the user environment and scanners.  Visioneer’s swappable parts will fit most, if not all, Visioneer scanners, and the OCC has made the decision to stock the most common parts for their scanners to limit downtime in the event of failure and to minimize the risk of multiple failures. The interoperability of parts provides significant savings to the OCC. Standardizing hardware also benefits potential recovery should a disaster render a scanner unusable and saves training dollars for IT staff.    This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued.  All offers received within 5 days after the date of this publication with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC.  Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Advanced Programming Concepts, Incorporated located in Austin, Texas.  The procurement is to upgrade the existing Multi-Radar Tracking System (MRTS) at Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) Fallon, Nevada.  Advanced Programming Concepts was determined to specifically address the unique requirements being utilized by Naval Strike Air Warfare Center.  This effort will upgrade the existing Version 11 multi-radar tracking system (MRTS) to Version 12 at the Naval Strike Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) Fallon, Nevada.  The Version 12 will mainly provide Fallon with Link 16 capability.  Advanced Programming Concepts (APC) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the MRTS. NSWC Corona Division and NSAWC Fallon originally acquired this item through competitive procurement.  The installation of a unit from another manufacturer will force NSAWC Fallon to acquire a radar display from another manufacturer, retrain personnel on the operation, maintenance, and repair of the new system at considerable cost.  Advanced Programming Concepts is the only source for this requirement and is solely capable of responding to ongoing support requirements. The multi-radar tracking system specifications are attached to this synopsis for industry information.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The applicable North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 and the size standard is $21.0 million.  All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling a similar requirement via e-mail to diemle.phan@gsa.gov by 4:00 p.m., PST, March 25, 2004.

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole source basis from History Associates Inc., Rockville, MD, for archival and digital archival services.  The period of performance is for one base year with option for four (4) successive one-year periods.  The initial period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about April 25, 2004 - April 25, 2005.  History Associates Inc. (HAI) has provided expert archival services to the NLM during the five years of the Digital Manuscripts Program.  The staff has considerable experience working with National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists, including conducting interviews and appraising manuscripts collections.  All personnel have security clearances, which further qualifies the staff to work with the papers of NIH scientists and complex government records.  The Digital Manuscripts Program has a two fold purpose: 1) appraisal and acquisition of papers of leading innovators in the fields of science, medicine, and public health; and 2) preservation and access to such papers via digital technology.  The project has high visibility, documenting the lives and contributions of prominent scientists, physicians, and public health officials, and the history of major scientific discoveries at NIH and elsewhere.  A key element of this project is an oral history component involving interview sessions and ongoing collaborations with donors throughout.  This project therefore requires several levels of historical and archival expertise including experience with oral history methods, processing of federal scientists' papers, and digital archival projects.  HAI has successfully accomplished numerous projects for the History of Medicine Division, NLM, and especially it's Modern Manuscripts Collections, over the past 10 years, including a 1997 pilot project to study the feasibility of implementing digital technology as an enhancement to accessing historical sources in the manuscripts collections.  The HAI staff currently employed on the Digital Manuscripts Program have been intricately involved in the design and development of the program since its inception and therefore the staff is knowledgeable and skilled in this type of work.  These skills are critical to the ongoing continuity of the program.  HAI possesses intimate knowledge of and familiarity with NLM's systems and processes that allow them to begin productive work immediately.  This allows NLM to avoid the weeks or months of training and orientation required to bring another company up to speed.  HAI employs certified archivists at the project management level and at the supervisory archivist level, which ensures that national standards of archival practice will be applied to all work accomplished.  This is a critical requirement for this project, since it is during this stage of transition to a new technology that such standards of practice must be applied.  Furthermore, because of the high profile of donors contributing to this program, contract personnel must have a Masters in Library Science or related graduate level degree or combined experience of at least five years in an archival setting, as well as experience with oral history interviewing.  HAI has demonstrated experience in each of these areas, as well as an established reputation in the field of archival management.  HAI personnel are highly trained, Academy of Certified Archivists (ACA) Certified Archivists or equivalent.  Their professional experience is critical for effective performance of this technically innovative project.  HAI has consistently delivered high quality products at competitive labor rates with cost effective program management.  HAI has a record of timely compliance with reporting requirements and provides written documentation of current processing and evaluation procedures.  Additionally, the project requires close collaboration with donors, curators, and digital project staff on a daily basis.  Availability on short notice and timely responsiveness to the day to day needs of the program throughout the length of this purchase order are essential requirements.  Interviews have been previously carried out with key donors to this project through the HAI oral history program.  This background uniquely prepares HAI for an understanding of historical events and subjects pertinent to this project and for developing selection criteria determining materials appropriate for digitization.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.
