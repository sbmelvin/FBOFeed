The purpose of this project modification  is to relocate the cross-over line between the new supply line and resevoir line to outside the chlorination building and replace the associated (previously-unknown) non-functioning valves to allow project completion and enable  the water storage tank to be taken out of service (when maintenance is required) while maintaining water service to the base water distribution system.  Additionally, the modification is to construct a protective enclosure for the newly elevated tank valve pit to protect system components from environmental factors (i.e. freezing, rain, etc..), and also reduce maintenance and operation costs by not having to handle stormwater within shelter (i.e. no need for sump pump) and providing longer life to system components.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron, Eglin AFB, FL anticipates awarding a sole source Firm Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz (RWMS) AG Birch Strasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395. It is anticipated that the total purchase order period of performance will not exceed five (5) months from time of award and will have an estimated value of $100,000.00. The USAF will procure Tungsten alloy raw materials for approximately 1650 rounds of Rheinmetall 25mm x 137mm FAP ammunition to evaluate firing performance with respect to the GAU-22/A gun/ammunition/aircraft interface requirements. <br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The authority for this action is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1: Agency requirements can only be met by one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with DFARS 206.302-1, this authority is applicable as it may be used for "acquisitions of test articles and associated support services from a designated foreign source under the DoD Foreign Comparative Testing Program." The USAF has been authorized to conduct a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program by OSD to evaluate and qualify a 25mm x 137 Frangible Armor Piercing (FAP) round for the USAF Joint Strike Fighter's GAU-22/A gun system. <br />The candidate FAP round chosen for this FCT is developed and manufactured by (RWMS), formerly Oerlikon Contraves Pyrotec AG. An ammunition study was conducted in 2005. The result of this exhaustive study was that only ammunition proposed by Rheinmetall satisfied both effectiveness and safety requirements. Market Research completed in 2008 as part of the FCT confirmed Rheinmetall ammunition to be the only suitable choice available. As a result, the government selected the Rheinmetall 25mm x 137mm FAP round for the FCT project. The materials acquired under this purchase order are specialized materials required for the manufacture of the Rheinmetall FAP round.<br />The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified below. The Ombudsman is Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422. Collect calls will not be accepted.

Avery, Jr. AAC/CS, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is 850-882-5422.<br />For subcontracting opportunities, please contact Oskar Brodmann, 41443163741 or Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions Schweiz AG, Birch Strasse 155; Zurich, Switzerland 79395.<br />Please forward any written statements of eligibility to 685 ARSS, Attn: Lt Jamesina Stuppy, 207 West D Avenue, Bldg 349, Suite 626, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6864, or facsimile (850) 882-7983 or e-mail Jamesina.Stuppy@eglin.af.mil.<br />

<SUBJECT>KC-135 ATS Interim Support
<SOLNBR>FA8223-10-R-135ATSinterim
<RESPDATE>122909
<CONTACT>Lance S Hardman, Contracting Officer, Phone (801) 777-6295, Fax (801) 777-5777, Email lance.hardman@hill.af.mil - Ramon Castillo, Contracting Officer, Phone (801) 586-2865, Email Ramon.Castillo@hill.af.mil
<DESC>Overview. This announcement is provided as part of on-going market research in support of KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS) requirements and is publicized in conjunction with the competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) identified under separate Notice Nr FA8223-10-R-50094, which is for long-term support of the ATS. <br />This Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential contractors (sources) who have the particular experience, skills and knowledge to accomplish the effort described and are interested in a short term contract for interim support while the processes applicable to the source selection for long term support are completed and that contract is awarded. As with the requirement under FA8223-10-R-50094, short-term support will be accomplished as an acquisition of services, follow-on to the support previously acquired under the prior long term contract, F33657-91-C-0072 with Flight Safety Services Corp which is scheduled to expire 30 Sep 2010. This short-term support would be limited to maintaining the training devices and Instructional Material (IM) to the baseline that will be in place at 30 Sep 2010, as described in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). No major upgrades or concurrency modifications will be accomplished during this short term interim. These are reserved for and as described in the re-competition effort under FA8223-10-R-50094. The anticipated period of performance for this short-term support contract will be for up to 1 year comprised of a 3-month base contract and three 3-month options, from 01 Oct 2010 through 30 Sep 2011 (FY 2011). This contract would only be issued and these Options would ONLY be exercised as the on-going process of awarding the contract under the re-competition effort for comprehensive ATS support dictates (see separate notice FA8223-10-R-50094).
<p>Intent. As indicated above, the current ATS contract will expire 30 Sep 2010. A new long term ATS acquisition effort is being accomplished by the AMC/Hill AFB KC-135 ATS Acquisition team as described in a separate notice (see www.fbo.gov for FA8223-10-R-50094). The anticipated award for this re-competed effort is in August 2010, with provision for a ramp-up period, as required. There is a possibility, however, that this long-term award may not be finalized by that date. If not finalized by the planned date, short-term interim support will be required to sustain KC-135 ATS training at the current levels. The Air Force believes that Flight Safety Services Corp. (FSSC) is the only source that can provide this short term interim support and will pursue a sole source justification for a contract for the period described above.</p>
<p>Program Overview. The KC-135 Simulator System is comprised of 19 KC-135 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), 2 Boom Operator Part Task Trainers (BOPTTs), 27 GATM IHC Part Task Trainers (GIPTT), 6 Cockpit Familiarization Trainers (CFT) in various configurations, over 400 Computer Based Training (CBT) Workstations and laptops, 25 AFMSS desktop trainers, 30 Instructor trainer laptops, 1 Cargo Loading Trainer, and Instructional Material (IM) (note: IM consists of courseware, photographs, and other associated items used in training sessions). Devices and IM are utilized at the main training facility, Altus AFB, and at twelve (12) other bases in the CONUS and OCONUS area. Two are OCONUS, Kadena and Mildenhall.</p>
<p>The KC-135 ATS is a broadly scoped, active and dynamic performance based services program providing initial qualification and re-qualification KC-135 training to Pilots, Boom Operators and Instructors. A very active operations tempo (large numbers of students) and impetus to move more training from the aircraft to the ATS/simulator under AFSO 21 initiatives also contributes challenges faced by this program.</p>
<p>Key objectives of the short term effort/program is not comprehensive for support and will be limited to: <br />1. Initial, continuation, and requalification training for KC-135 aircrew. Aircrews include pilots, navigators, and boom operators. <br />2. Maintaining the training devices and IM to the baseline that will be in place at 30 Sep 2010. No major upgrades or concurrency modifications will be accomplished during this short term interim period. These are reserved for and as described in the re-competition effort under FA8223-10-R-50094.<br />3. Provide facility management. <br />4. Provide Program Management including Systems Engineering, Quality Assurance, Data/Configuration Management, and ESOH management.</p>
<p>No Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) or other significant modification efforts are anticipated to be accomplished within the scope of or during this interim support effort. No further extensions are anticipated.</p>
<p>Known qualified sources shall identify themselves as recognized by this office from our past Market Research. Any other sources interested in or commenting on this requirement and responding to this synopsis shall describe their qualifications in the following areas:<br />1. Current and past experience in managing broadly scoped comprehensive contractor logistics support for this or similar training systems, including Training Systems Support Centers (TSSC), central and remote (multiple) training sites, and classified training. Experience serving as Prime Integrator for large training programs of a scope similar to those described above.<br />2. Current relevant experience in designing, building, networking, integrating, operating and maintaining devices of similar complexity and its relevance to the subject acquisition. <br />3. Personnel experience/qualifications in the areas of Training Systems Device Engineering, modification management, and integration. <br />4. Personnel experience/qualifications in the areas of courseware Instructional System Design (ISD), modification, management and instruction.</p>
<p>Responses must be received in the office from which this notice originates no later than 1400 Hours, Mountain Standard Time, 29 Dec 09. The point of contact for this requirement is the Contracting Officer, Lance S Hardman. Responses should be directed to the following E-mail address: lance.hardman@hill.af.mil</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is soliciting quotes for the removal of snow for the Animas La-Plata project located in Durango, CO, required during the upcoming winter season from December, 2009 through April 15th, 2010.  Snow removal is required at numerous locations to ensure employee access to the main office building and field trailers, and to provide access to the pumping plant and dam site operations facilities to conduct daily inspection duties corresponding to pumping/filling functions associated with Lake Nighthorse reservoir or other miscellaneous construction activities.  Snow removal activities will be required at the 6 following locations;
1.  Main Office complex and parking area (Located at 103 Everette Street, Durango,     CO - See attached Exhibit "A")2.  Durango Pumping Plant field trailers and parking area (Located northeast off County     Road #CR211 - See attached Exhibits "B and C")3.  Durango Pumping Plant operations facility (Located northeast off County Road     #CR211 - See attached Exhibits "B and D")4.  Gravel Section of County Road #CR211 (Intersection of County Road #CR212     traveling south approx 1-mile to Ridges Basin Dam field trailer - See attached     Exhibit "E")5.  Ridges Basin Dam field trailer and parking area (Located west off gravel section      of County Road #CR211 - See attached Exhibit "F")6.  Access Downstream of Ridges Basin Dam and Top of Dam (Located off County Road      #CR213-La Posta Road traveling northwest approx 3.5-miles to damsite - See      attached Exhibits "G and H")
General Requirements:
In general, snow removal from access roads and parking areas listed above will be required 24-hours per day 7-days per week throughout the duration of the service contract, unless waived by the government.  This removal will be required anytime snow accumulations on the ground exceed 4-inches, or upon notification by the government that slippery or slushy conditions do exist which present a potential safety concern regardless of the snow depth.  Severe weather conditions that persist resulting in snow accumulations of 4-inches or more being exceeded several times throughout the duration of a single storm event, may require subsequent snow removal trips.  Some sanding on icy/slick areas, especially hills, which present potential safety risks may be required to ensure safe passage.  Any subsequent snow removal requested by the government due to blown and drifting snow developing after completion of plowing activities between individual storm events, will be considered call back work and will be paid on an hourly basis for this type of additional work.
Site conditions of the roadways on the project consist of both paved and all weather graveled road surfaces.  All roadways must be maintained to a minimum of 24-foot in width, to permit travel in both directions and permit passing.  Various access road conditions to be encountered on the project exist, including; both uphill and downhill grades, steep drop offs, winding curves, corners, and limited turnaround in some locations.  Clearing roadways for access into the DPP operations facility and RBD Control House/first fill sheds will be required.  In addition; plowing around 6 portable light plants located at various locations downstream of the dam will be required to permit servicing and fueling of the equipment as needed.

<DESC>The Department of the Treasury Office of Technical Assistance is recruiting individuals on a competitive basis to serve as resident and/or intermittent (short-term) advisors, under personal services contracts, for its Banking and Financial Services Program.  This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.  

The Banking and Financial Services Program is charged with promoting commercial banking sector development that efficiently intermediates between savers and investors.  To achieve this, the program works with central banks, ministries of finance, banking regulatory and supervision agencies, deposit insurance agencies, banking associations, and other banking related entities in countries with emerging or transition economies.  It also provides technical assistance to countries that have developed economies but are experiencing difficulties in their banking sectors.

QUALIFICATIONS: Treasury is seeking candidates who possess expertise in banking and bank regulation with specific experience in the restructuring and privatization of banks; banking sector development, asset management and disposition; banking supervision (on-site and off-site); deposit guaranty systems; central bank operations; monetary policy; credit analysis; lending; bank liquidations; and other facets of banking sector activity.  A working knowledge of French, Spanish, or Arabic will be a plus in relevant countries.  Ideal candidates would have experience with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, Resolution Trust Corporation, international financial institutions, and/or commercial banks.  Prior overseas experience working in challenging environments would be a distinct advantage but is not mandatory.  While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of officials in host countries is also very important.
 
Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries will be negotiated in accordance with program regulations based on demonstrated salary history. Expected compensation currently ranges from $120,830 to $162,900, subject to January 1, 2010 cost of living adjustments. Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applicants must be able to obtain medical and security clearances.  This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2010, although selections maybe made in advance of that date.  To apply, please send cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: recruitment@ota.treas.gov or by mail to: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N.W. – 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.

Please reference Solicitation Number A10-025 on your resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.  No Phone calls please and no hand carries.  If you wish to be considered for this announcement and all future announcements for the Financial Institutions Policy and Regulation Program, you must state so in the cover letter to your application.

<DESC>NASAs GSFC/WFF plans to issue a modification to increase the contract ceiling onthe Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract with the VirginiaCommercial Space Flight Authority (VCSFA) operating under the name Mid-Atlantic RegionalSpace Port (MARS) for launch site services supporting government-sponsored missionsconducted from GSFCs Wallops Flight Facility (WFF). This modification will increase thecontract ceiling value to $43,400,000, and will increase the scope of the contract tosupport the current and long term capability of GSFC/WFF to provide launch serviceinfrastructure to safely and successfully launch small/medium class orbital launchmissions for NASA,  other federal organizations, and NASAs commercial partners.NASA/GSFC/WFF intends to issue the modification on a noncompetitive basis to VCSFA/MARSin accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "only one or alimited number of responsible sources and no other types of supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements." VCSFA/MARS maintains the only specialized expertise andcapability to build and operate existing launch infrastructure such as ground processingand launch pad activities, capable of satisfying small/medium launch vehicle requirementsat Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia to meet the critical schedule forcurrent and upcoming missions.	The schedule is very compressed due to the impendingshutdown of Space Transportation System (STS) operations by NASA.  The first launchrequirement drives the first use of these facilities to occur in late 2010 which is instark contrast with the time it would take for another entity to establish parallelspaceport operations at WFF (estimated by NASA at 3-5 years, because of multi-agencylicensing, environmental studies, technical/infrastructure interfaces, etc).Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time,December 30, 2009.

<DESC>SUBJECT: Community Announcement on Explorer AONNH10ZDA004JCommunity Announcement on Explorer AODecember 10, 2009The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate(SMD) is releasing this Community Announcement concerning its intention to solicitinvestigations for the Explorer Program. The Explorer Program conducts PrincipalInvestigator (PI)-led space science investigations in SMD's astrophysics and heliophysicsprograms. Explorer investigations are intended to obtain an understanding of the Sun andits effects on Earth and the Solar System and/or to discover the origin, structure,evolution, and destiny of the Universe and search for Earth-like planets. Additionalinformation concerning these areas of investigation is provided through appropriate linksfound on the SMD homepage at http://nasascience.nasa.gov/   . The current state of planning calls for NASA SMD to release an Announcement ofOpportunity (AO) in the late summer/early fall of 2010 that will solicit proposals forExplorer (EX) missions to accomplish Explorer Program science objectives. NASA also plansto release simultaneously a solicitation for Explorer Missions of Opportunity (MO)through the NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH08ZDA009O, Stand Alone Missions ofOpportunity Notice (SALMON). A draft EX AO and draft SALMON amendment is expected to beready for release for comment in Spring 2010. The PI-managed mission cost cap for an EX mission is expected to be no greater than $200Min Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 dollars, not including the cost of the Expendable Launch Vehicle(ELV) or any contributions. Standard launch services on an ELV will be provided for EXmissions at no charge against the mission cost cap. Only the launch services described inthe Explorer Program Librarys launch services document will be provided (seehttp://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/EX  ). There will be a charge against the mission cost capfor mission unique and special launch services beyond the standard launch servicesoffered. The PI-managed mission cost cap for an Explorer MO is expected to be no greater than $55Min Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 dollars. NASA expects to solicit MO science investigations thatare defined in the SALMON AO as either Partner MOs or Small Complete Mission MOs,including investigations requiring flight on long duration balloons and the InternationalSpace Station. The currently approved Explorer Program planning budget is sufficient to select andexecute at least one EX mission. It is also sufficient to select and execute a second EXmission or at least one MO. The decision between these two options will be based upon theproposals received in response to the EX AO and the SALMON amendment; the decision willincorporate the most recent planning budget information available at that time. The current planning is for the selection process to be done in two stages. In step 1, itis anticipated that up to four EX missions may be selected for one-year Phase A conceptstudies. Each concept study would be funded up to $1M in real year dollars. For step 2,NASA will conduct a detailed review of the Phase A concept study reports. As a result ofthis second evaluation, NASA expects to select one or two EX missions to proceed intoPhase B and subsequent mission phases. NASA desires to launch the first of the two EXmissions by mid 2016; the launch-by date for any additional mission, if selected, is late2018. Additionally, investigations proposing to achieve Explorer Program science objectivesthrough participation in Missions of Opportunity may be selected for Phase A study andreview if their perceived value to the Explorer Program is high and the proposed cost iswithin the funding limit for this Mission of Opportunity. NASA may select no Mission ofOpportunity proposals if these objectives are not met by any proposals. Proposals in response to this AO will be due 90 days after its formal release.Participation will be open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S. organizations,including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, FederallyFunded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers and other Government agencies. The schedule for the solicitation is intended to be:    Release of draft AO: (target) Spring 2010 (target);    Explorer workshop: ~2 weeks after draft AO release;    Release of final AO: (target) Late summer/early fall 2010 (target);    Pre-proposal conference: ~3 weeks after final AO release;    Proposals due: 90 days after AO release;   Selection for competitive Phase A studies: Summer 2011 (target);    Concept study reports due: Summer 2012 (target);    Down-selection: Late 2012 (target); The Explorer Program EX AO and SALMON amendment may contain provisions that differsubstantially from this preliminary notice, in which case the provisions in the AO andSALMON amendment will take precedence. The Explorer AO will be based on the StandardPI-led Mission AO Template available at http://sso.larc.nasa.gov/aosimplification.html	. Proposers should read the Draft EX AO carefully when it is released. NASA has not approved the issuance of the EX AO or SALMON amendment and this notificationdoes not obligate NASA to issue the announcements and solicit proposals. Any costsincurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response to thisannouncement are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk. Further information will be posted on the Explorer Program Acquisition website athttp://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/EX   as that information becomes available. Questions orcomments about this intention to release an EX AO may be addressed in writing or bye-mail to the Explorer Program Acquisition Scientist: Dr. Barbara L. Giles, Ref.:Explorer EX AO, Heliophysics Division, Mail Suite 3R15, Science Mission Directorate,National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Washington, DC 20546-0001, E-mail:barbara.giles@nasa.gov (subject line to read "Explorer EX AO"). Responses to allinquiries will be answered by e-mail and also posted weekly at the Frequently AskedQuestions (FAQ) location of the Explorer Program Acquisition website; anonymity ofpersons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.

<DESC>Subject: Community Announcement on a NASA Solicitation for ExoMars Trace GasOrbiter InstrumentsNNH10ZDA005JCommunity Announcement on a NASA Solicitation for ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter InstrumentsDecember 11, 2009The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate(SMD) and the European Space Agency (ESA) intend to release in January 2010 ansolicitation requesting proposals for instruments to be flown on the ExoMars Trace GasOrbiter with the objective of studying trace gases in the atmosphere of Mars. Thissolicitation will be issued as an amendment to the SALMON (Stand Alone Mission ofOpportunity Notice) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) (released as NNH08ZDA009O; availableat http://nspires.nprs.com/	  ).OVERVIEW OF THE OPPORTUNITYThe solicitation will be a Focused Mission of Opportunity (FMO) element of the omnibusSALMON AO.  It will invite proposals for a suite of instruments to address the followingprioritized scientific goals. 1. Detect a broad suite of atmospheric trace gases and key isotopes;2. Characterize the spatial and temporal variation of methane and other key species,ideally representing families of photochemically important trace gases (HOx, NOx,hydrocarbons, etc) and their source molecules (e.g. H2O); 3. Localize the sources and derive the evolution of methane and other key species andtheir possible interactions, including interactions with atmospheric aerosols and howthey are affected by the atmospheric state (temperature and distribution of major sourcegases; e.g. water); and4. Image surface features possibly related to trace gas sources and sinks.Anticipating approval of the joint ESA-NASA Mars Exploration Programme by the ESACouncil, this AO will be the first competed element of the ESA-NASA joint MarsExploration Programme.	The agencies anticipate conducting the selection of instrumentsthrough a highly coordinated process respecting the established processes of each agency.Participation in this AO will be open to all categories of organizations in the UnitedStates, in ESA member states, as well as in other countries, including educationalinstitutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research andDevelopment Centers (FFRDC's), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), andother Government agencies.  Principal Investigators are responsible for and allowed to assemble investigation teamsfrom any and all of these organizations.Given that this mission is part of the joint ESA-NASA Mars Exploration Programme,instrument proposals having an international dimension are encouraged.	In particular,participation is encouraged from scientists in the U.S. and in countries contributing toESA's Aurora Program (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Germany, Italy,the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).The cost cap for the entire suite of instruments requiring NASA funds and selected inresponse to this AO will be approximately $100 Million.  The launch of the ExoMars TraceGas Orbiter mission is targeted for January 2016. ESA does not fund the development and exploitation of instruments for its spacecraft.However, under ESA coordination, the national agencies and research institutions takingpart in ESAs Aurora Program and submitting proposal to this opportunity will beresponsible for funding any instruments selected in response to this Announcement.  THE EXOMARS TRACE GAS ORBITER INSTRUMENTS.The scientific goals and a strawman mission are described in detail in the Report of theJoint Investigation Definition Team (JIDT), which is available in the SALMON ReferenceLibrary at http://salmon.larc.nasa.gov/salmonreflib.html	.  The JIDT report discusses a potential set of instruments to address the mission sciencegoals outlined above.  Proposers should note that this was offered as a proof of concept,and does not represent any pre-selection by either ESA or NASA of instruments ortechniques to accomplish the mission science goals. The strawman payload of individualinstrument allocations are shown in the JIDT Report but should only be considered as aguideline.  DETAILS OF THE PLANNED SOLICITATIONImportant characteristics of this AO are expected to be:a) Although this is a joint ESA-NASA mission, NASA will provide the logistical supportfor submission of proposals. b) Pending the submission of an adequate number of proposals of merit, ESA and NASAexpect to select a combination of instrument investigations that address the missionscience objectives.c) The review process will be tightly coordinated between NASA and ESA, and to the extentpossible will be conducted jointly. d) Any ESA Member State Investigator wishing to participate in the ExoMars Trace GasOrbiter science must apply to the AO. e) NASA welcomes proposals having participants from non-U.S. institutions provided thatthey are offered on a no-exchange-of-funds basis and also comply with current U.S.restrictions concerning the export of technology.f) ESA welcomes proposals having participants from non-European institutions providedthat they are offered on a no-exchange-of-funds basis.g) Data from ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter investigations must be made fully public in ausable form as soon as is practical.  All data products shall be documented, validated,and calibrated in physical units usable by the scientific community at large.The following schedule describes the anticipated major milestones of the ExoMars TraceGas Orbiter Instruments Announcement of Opportunity.  These dates are subject to change.AO Release approximately -				Mid- January, 2010Pre proposal Conference (Telecon) -			Release + 2 wksNotice of Intent to Propose due -			Release + 4 weeksProposals due - 					Release + 3 monthsNon-U.S. Letters of Endorsement -			due with proposalsSelections announced (target) - 			July 2010Release of this AO is in the process of formally being approved by NASA and ESA.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO PRESIDIO NETWORKED SOLUTIONS, INC. FOR RESEASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to Delivery Order 0001 issued against Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) TIRNO-10-Z-00003.  Delivery Order 0001 was awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, Inc., for maintenance of Perpetual Licensed BMC enterprise software.  The purpose of the modification is to provide an additional 290 millions of instructions per second (MIPS), upgraded license capacity and maintenance through September 30, 2010, to BMC software the IRS already owns.  In meeting the spirit of ARRA, this modification will be executed as a firm-fixed price action to a previously competed BPA awarded to Presidio Networked Solutions, a small business. 

These upgrades are needed to support new workloads in the IRS mainframe environment.  Mission critical tax applications will be affected by the changes implemented by the ARRA such that increased workload volumes and changes will require additional processing resources.  The increased workloads include processing new Business Master File (BMF) tax forms and handling increased volumes of queries to support customer interactions with the IRS for other tax application systems.  This acquisition will provide the software licenses and maintenance for the additional processor capacity required to process the new workloads.

<RESPDATE>122909
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Office of Acquisitions, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, for professional service to support the NIA's Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) Study. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.
<p>The NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP), Clinical Research Branch (CRB), Health Disparities Section (HDS) is embarking on a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community-dwelling residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. This study requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of this region and the ways in which racial and socioeconomic data must be collected to assess their influence on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysiological and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning. Nutritional status influences an individual's risk for the development of chronic conditions, thereby affecting a person's ability to live a healthy and productive life. This project will define the criteria for determining the sample population's nutritional status and the effects of nutritional status over the course of the longitudinal study.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the expertise necessary to implement a nutritional monitoring program as part of the HANDLS study, specifically when working with widely diverse populations including minorities and the aging. Nutritional monitoring is an essential tool to collect and analyze the individual's proprietary information on dietary intake, food and nutrient consumption and the individual's ability to recall their consumption. Research methods to be provided through this project include the segregation and determination of sample design as based on nutritional factors associated with geographic regions, socioeconomic strata, race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Dr. Kuczmarski of the University of Delaware is widely recognized as an expert in the fields aging and minority nutrition. Dr. Kuczmarski has been a senior co-investigator with the HANDLS program since 2003. She is a contributing member of the HANDLS working advisors group and the senior scientific advisory committee for the longitudinal study (HANDLS). She developed the nutritional protocols for this study and is a lead author on several manuscripts that have been published as a result of her continued contributions to the project. Dr. Kuczmarski's specific development of and expertise in the nutritional survey and scoring methodology could not be accomplished by another vendor. Her defined work with such diverse population groups as those considered by the HANDLS program make her eminently qualified for the performance of the proposed acquisition. Awarding the contract to another vendor would have detrimental impact on the on-going study.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>1. Train all dietary interview staff in the use of the AMPM interview;<br />2. Train and supervise coding and AMPM telephone data collection staff;<br />3. Provide quality control assessments for data collection and coding;<br />4. Provide monthly technical and operational consultation regarding system operations and quality assurance procedures and oversight;<br />5. Provides technical support for the processing of dietary recalls collected in HANDLS utilizing the USDA Post interview processing System for extraction of AMPM Blaise databases, reformatting AMPM data for SurveyNet, and auto-coding of foods and portion sizes;<br />6. Write quarterly articles related to the nutritional component of the HANDLS study, for the newsletter, Healthy Journal;<br />7. Analyzes data and prepares manuscripts for publication;<br />8. Defines the criteria for determining the sample population's nutritional status and the effects of nutritional status over the course of the longitudinal study.</p>
<p>The period of performance of this acquisition is for twelve (12) months from the date of award. Place of performance is in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested party believes it can meet the above requirement may submit a statement of capabilities on or before 2:00 PM local time Tuesday, December 29, 2009 to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if the party can perform the requirement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Technical Support for Revision of Regulatory Guides
<SOLNBR>NRC-RFP-10-164
<CONTACT>Sheila H. Bumpass, Phone 3014923484, Email Sheila.Bumpass@NRC.GOV
<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a requirement to obtain contractor support to provide technical support to incorporate existing technical information into  proposed Regulatory Guide revisions, support presentations, respond to comments (from the public, Advisory Committee for Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), and the Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR), and provide additional technical support as needed.  Regulatory Guide revisions include the development of new Regulatory Guides.  In 2007, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) initiated a program to update selected Regulatory Guides.  Because the Regulatory Guides provide industry with a means of complying with the NRC regulations, it is more efficient for both the NRC and industry to use a set of Regulatory Guides that are consistent with current regulations.  The Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) coordinated with the other Program Offices (the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), Office of New Reactors (NRO), Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS), and Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs (FMSE)) to commonly prioritize and align the Regulatory Guides based on the anticipated need for an updated version.  There are currently 426 active Regulatory Guides or Regulatory Guides to be developed.  Of these 426 Regulatory Guides, an estimated 51 are in need of technical support for revision.  

The NRC anticipates awarding one single award indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery task order contract on an unrestrictive basis, and one single award indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery task order contract as a small business set-aside. 

The solicitation is expected to be posted on or about December 29, 2009.  The solicitation package is only available through FEDBIZOPS.

This will be a sole source modification under the authority of 41 U.S.C.  253(c)(1).  This modification will extend the current contract through February 28, 2009 and will bridge USPTO’s ITPA support until award of follow-on task orders under the GSA’s Alliant Small Business Governmentwide Acquisition Contract Program.  The current contract support has been redefined into the following three functional areas:  Independent Testing, Configuration Management and IT Security (Certification and Accreditation C&A) support services.  Request for Quotes (RFQ’s) for the aforementioned services were released in December of 2009 with award expected no later than February of 2010.  SRA, as the incumbent contractor and provider of the aforementioned services since 2004, is uniquely qualified to provide the required services within the required timeframes until award of the follow-on orders.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE 874 (Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services – MOBIS).



THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES/OFFICE OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR PLANNING AND EVALUATION THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER HAS A REQUIREMENT TO PURCHASE THE FOLLOWING SERVICE.

Service Description –

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) created a Federal Coordinating Council (FCC) for Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) and charged it with developing recommendations on how to invest funding appropriated to the Secretary for comparative effectiveness research.  The Council recommended, and the Secretary agreed, that a robust longitudinal claims infrastructure to support CER was critical.

There exist a number of databases with longitudinal claims data that could facilitate analysis of such data for CER purposes.  Each, however, has limitations in its application to CER.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  Integrated Data Repository (IDR), Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW), and Medicaid claims files (MAX) databases include data only on the Medicare and Medicaid populations; state-based all-payor, all-claims databases are limited geographically in scope and by variability in infrastructure design and state capability; private databases may include information on a more demographically diverse population, but are still fragmented and often inaccessible to researchers due to cost.

An all-payor, all-claims database would allow for greater power in analysis, ensuring that the data infrastructure the Secretary supports will be able to produce robust analysis.  If developed well, this database would be a representative sample of the population and could be built upon over time.  The public commentary at FCC listening sessions affirmed the value of an all-payor, all-claims database.  Claims data, especially if established in a manner where it can be linked to other data over time, can be powerful a tool for CER and ultimately improve care for all Americans.

Given the breadth of potential options for building an all-payor, all-claims database and the significant investment required to do so successfully, HHS will award a contract for a targeted design study to inform the creation of such a database and supporting services, methods, and skills.

THIS PROCUREMENT WILL BE FUNDED VIA THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009.  INTERESTED VENDORS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE A MOBIS GSA SCHEDULE 874 CONTRACT MAY REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION FROM THE CONTRACT SPECIAL

<DESC>Notification of Sole Source Intent for Catholic priest Chaplain ServicesThe Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, intends to negotiate a sole source contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, only two (2) responsible sources for Catholic Chaplain Services.A firm fixed price contract with four (4) option years is anticipated and shall be awarded. It is the Governments belief that only the proposed candidates possess the required background, experience and capabilities to successfully meet this requirement. It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.This is not a request for proposal. However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include their ability to meet these requirements, past performance information and price. This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due no later than December 21, 2009. Phone inquiries will not be accepted.Justification for this sole source:1.  Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:VA Boston Healthcare System:  Chaplain Service - 523-10-1-7074-00072.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:	1.	The selected Catholic Chaplains will provide sacrament and pastoral care to all newly admitted Roman Catholic patients within the previous 24-hour period.2.	The selected Catholic Chaplains will be responsible to visit all Roman Catholic patients assuring that all these patients will receive at least one visit during their in-patient stay.3.	The selected Catholic Chaplains will work on Sundays and celebrate Mass for the patients and families at a regularly scheduled time or when the regularly scheduled priest is away on leave.4.	The selected Catholic Chaplains will work either full time or a 4-hour shift three days a week or at times more when the other Catholic Chaplains are on leave status. 5.	Should the selected Catholic Chaplain return to the medical center for an emergency call-back, he will be compensated two hours pay at the negotiated rate.6.	At no time will the selected Catholic Chaplain proselytize to a patient or attempt to persuade or coerce a patient to lean toward a particular belief.3.  Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):	Requisition 523-10-10-7074-0007  Estimated value is $62,000.00	Description: Catholic Chaplain ServicesBasic Requirements are:1.	The selected Catholic priests must be clinically certified and endorsed by the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA in Washington, DC as listed with ECVAC (Endorsers Conference for Veterans Affairs Chaplaincy).2.	It is desired that the selected Catholic priest should possess a Masters of Divinity.3.	The selected Catholic priest must have completed all the equivalencies of pastoral education to work in a clinical setting.4.	The selected Catholic priest must be willing and able to work and interact with VA Chaplains in a pluralistic environment respecting their beliefs and practices.4.	  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:Far 6.302-1, USC 253 (c)(1) Unique Source of Only one Responsible Source5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:	Vendor is an ordained Roman Catholic Priest6.  Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This is an urgent need of the VA Boston Healthcare System Chaplain Service and is requesting an expedient processing to acquisition the contract chaplain.A Sources Sought was published on Fed Biz Ops and there were no qualified respondents.A CCR search for available Catholic priests was performed.  All possible respondents were personally called and Father Nichols and Father Curran were the only qualified priests7.

Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:The CCR search for Catholic Priests in the Boston or Rhode Island area identified only Father Curran and Father Nichols.In the case of Roman Catholic Priests in the Boston Archdiocese, no other Priests are being released to be endorsed by the Archdiocese of the Military Services, USA due to their shortage of Priests to staff their own Parishes and Ministries.9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as  an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.All were developed and are available.

Background

The objective of this study is to provide the NRC with the latest cancer incidence and mortality data for populations living near past and present licensed nuclear power reactors.  This study will give the agency the latest credible scientific information for responding to stakeholders’ concerns related to cancer incidence and mortality in populations that live near licensed nuclear power plants.  Additional analyses will be performed at potential future sites to provide a baseline population cancer risk should a commercial nuclear power reactor be built on the site.

The NRC has determined that the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, operated by the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), is qualified to provide these services.  ORAU has successfully started work on the epidemiology study.  The NRC would like to indentify potential commercial services to conduct the study before continuing with ORAU. 

In your submittal please provide evidence of the following capabilities: 

1)  Demonstrated ability to interpret and generalize epidemiological results with a large number of statistical tests. Demonstrated experience in developing high quality, technically defensible work products per contractual timelines and within budget. 
 
2)  Demonstrated experience with and knowledge of the availability and accessibility of cancer mortality and incidence databases at the national and State level.  

3)  Demonstrated experience presenting technical information to an independent peer review committee and responding to and incorporating comments.

4)  Demonstrated education and publishing record in the field of radiation epidemiology with a strong preference for investigators at the doctoral level.  Other technical areas critical to the study are biostatistics, geographical information systems (GIS), radiation health effects, and risk communication.

5)  Demonstrated expertise in applying GIS to public health applications. 

6)  Demonstrated experience in database management and in protection of personally identifiable information.

7)  Demonstrated experience in communicating epidemiological results to a diverse range of stakeholders.  Those stakeholders could include the general public living near the licensed reactors, the general public-at-large, interested non-governmental organizations, the media, other Federal, State, and local government agencies, Congress, and the scientific community.

<DESC>The purpose of this "sources sought" notice is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the West Palm Beach, FL area within the guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs (OJP).
<p>The requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the OJP guidelines state that the cost of any meal provided, plus any applicable hotel service costs or fees, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. <br />For the West Palm Beach, FL area, the M&amp;IE rate is $71.00 per person.</p>
<p>&bull; If breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $71.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $12.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $18.00 ($12.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>&bull; If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $71.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $18.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $27.00 ($18.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The OJP guidelines also define refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the OJP guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the West Palm Beach, FL area, the M&amp;IE rate is $71.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $16.33 ($71.00 X 23%) per person per day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and willing to meet the OJP guidelines should complete the attached Conference Matrix Worksheet and submit a statement of capabilities to include the following:<br />&bull; Sleeping Capacity <br />&bull; Meeting capacity<br />&bull; Floor charts<br />&bull; Actual Food and beverage menus supporting the pricing mentioned above (inclusive of hotel service costs and per diem): breakfast less than or equal to $18.00 per person; lunch less than or equal to $27.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $16.33 per person.</p>

<SUBJECT>Unified IP Communication System
<SOLNBR>DOC-SS-PAPT091006
<RESPDATE>091509
<CONTACT>Sylvia G Van Dyke, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-272-6568, Fax 571-2723-6568, Email sylvia.vandyke@uspto.gov
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research to determine potential products and sources/companies to design, develop, and deploy a Unified IP Communication System. This system must meet the requirements set forth in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, be Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 compliant, and would:

•	Enable employees to communicate and interact effectively with internal and external customers in a distributed workforce environment.
•	Reduce current communication system operating costs by converging communications technologies and consolidating and decommissioning end of life or redundant communications equipment and applications.
•	Provide conferencing tools so teleworkers can effectively join, participate, and collaborate in meetings and training sessions from the home office.    

The following table lists twelve examples of business collaboration and communication scenarios that the Unified IP Communication System would address. 

	Category	(a.k.a)
1	External Customer Walkup Videoconferencing	Customer goes to a Video Teleconference (VTC) interview room on the USPTO campus and participates in a VTC with USPTO employees in remote offices.

2	External Customer/Employee Videoconferencing	Customer uses their own Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.320, or H.323 VTC system and participates in a VTC with USPTO employees on campus or in remote offices.

3	Virtual Employee Assistance Assistance initiated via chat to predefined support rooms.  Employee Contact information automatically accessible by Customer Support.  Customer support uses “one click access” capability to access remote workstation or call employee.

4	Virtual Meetings Rooms	Floor conference rooms outfitted to enable USPTO employees to chair videoconferences without additional assistance.  Users should be able to start videoconference within 5 minutes of entering the conference room.  Invite remote participants to conference via Outlook.  Participants join conference with one mouse click. From Outlook Calendar event.    

5	Virtual Conferences (Webcasts)	USPTO Auditoriums and Building Conference Centers outfitted with web-casting (i.e., robotic cameras and audio/video interface to audio-visual (AV) system).  Non-interactive meeting of 100+.  Participants can submit questions and respond to polling.  Remote presenters connect via VTC.

6	Virtual Training Rooms	Physical classroom outfitted with cameras and presentation tools that are integrated into a “distance learning” solution/system.  Interactive experience with <50 students.  Some students in physical classroom… some students participating via “distance learning” solution/system.

7	User Paced Remote Training (Learn Any Time, Anywhere)	Computer Based Training (CBT) modules available via Intranet pages.

8	Production of content and Re-broadcast of content On Demand	Broadcast/produce the live event via web-cast (see Virtual Conferences above.)   Ability for employee (or customer) to visit a web site and select a recording of a missed conference, training session, USPTO event, etc.... “on demand”.

9	Peer to Peer Collaboration 	Starting with a visual representation of a person’s availability (presence), quickly send an IM and seamlessly move to a call, add video, and escalate to a web conference to share applications or data files.  Extend conference to multiple parties with ease.

10	Electronic Team Rooms (Virtual Communities)	Repository for user supplied content.   Users maintain profile and collaborate via workflow, messaging, discussion forums, blogs, and wikis.  Widgets (SharePoint Web Parts) enable dynamic, interactive business intelligence portals that display information from disparate sources.  Users quickly locate posted information via “Search”.     

11	Unified Communications	Integrate all forms (e-mail, IM, audio, voicemail, and presence) of communication.   One employee = one telephone number.  Customer calls one number, employee receives call regardless of location, if working… otherwise, and voice mail is activated.

12	Jurisprudence
Collaboration 	Require a user friendly solution that would permit at least a three judge panel working remotely to meet and edit working documents which tie the edits to the author of the edits (Extended Peer to Peer).  Requirements will quickly expand to at least six members at one time.

Figure 1 provides an overview of USPTO’s current communication systems.

Sandia is seeking a company or companies to commercialize the technology described in this posting, and expects the successful company(ies) to engage in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) and / or license the technology from Sandia.<span>&nbsp; </span>Commercial licensees will have the opportunity to request an exclusive license to the intellectual properties in a defined field of use for reasonable compensation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is expected that the company(ies) will promptly incorporate this technology into a commercial product.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Potential partners must provide Sandia information describing their ability to research, design, develop, manufacture, distribute, and market the nanostructure technology. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The dendritic metallic nanostructure technology can be used to produce platinum catalysts with unique shape, size, porosity, composition, stability, and other functional properties.<span>&nbsp; </span>Novel catalysts and electrocatalysts produced by this approach are expected to significantly reduce the amount of platinum metal used and thus the cost of platinum catalysts for fuel cells, solar cells, and other applications.<span>&nbsp; </span>The platinum nanostructures also exhibit enhanced structural stability thus preserving the high surface area and activity of the nanocatalysts in a wide variety of important technological and industrial applications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Description
The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Rapid Fielding Directorate, Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as “Challenge Proposals” proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. 
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that “challenge” an incumbent and have the potential to be applied within 6-18 months after contract award, with highest priority given to proposals that demonstrate near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation.  To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of technologies or processes proposed must be TRL 7 (a working prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) and TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing.  The following operational areas (not listed in priority) are focus areas for US Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agency activities engaged in Overseas Contingency Operations: Forward Operating Base (FOBs) Protection; Hostile Fire / Aircrew Protection (small arms & MANPADS); Advanced Individual Weapons; Readily Available Civil Engineering Tools (e.g., for Afghanistan infrastructure); Autonomous and Portable Air, Ground, and Underwater System Operation; Tactical Unit Field Medical Capabilities; Small Unit, Dispersed Operations; Enhanced Soldier Protection; Space Situational Awareness;  Improved Power Sources & Synthetic Fuels; Aircrew & Equipment Cooling Capabilities; Improved Logistics; and Interfaces between Law Enforcement & Military Operations.  Challenge proposals that address warfighter effectiveness, survivability, sustainability and logistics will be considered.  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  
The full review and evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit an Initial Proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under “Reference Materials” on the website. Although not required in this first phase, a letter of support/endorsement from the Service/USSOCOM Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the acquisition program can be electronically submitted with the proposal. All correctly completed proposals will undergo a panel review. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the existing acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and minimal disruption. Initial Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for project selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. The DoD program manager of the acquisition program of record (POR) identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a technical review of the proposal.  The DoD Program Manager, with input from the prime system contractor on the program, as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Full Proposal for the SECOND PHASE. The DoD Program Manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include validation/qualitative or comparative testing based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Proposals submitted by Program Managers are prioritized and compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas completed on the initial DAC proposal submission, the Full Proposal must include: key performance parameters (technology/product/process objectives); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart (using the most current formats under “Reference Materials” on the website), with cost category summary for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the DoD acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required for the Full Proposal. By law, DAC funds can be used to purchase test articles and related test costs only, and cannot be used for full rate production items.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and those criteria deemed appropriate for project selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in an acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the challenge proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their challenge proposal(s). 
Subject to the availability of funds, all proposals will be considered for accelerated testing in FY 2010 if they address critical warfighting needs in Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq) or Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan).  Although selections may be made at any time after the close of the BAA, we will complete the deliberate proposal review for FY 2011 by 1 October 2010.  All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. Email defensechallenge@osd.mil for mailing instructions. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the proposal submitter. It should be assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. 
This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract.  Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a contracting officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. This BAA and two-phased evaluation process meets the requirements for fair and open competition.  However, the final determination for contract award resides with the DoD contracting officer from the sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received at the DAC website NLT 2000 hours EST, 22 February 2010. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All proposal submissions must comply with the submission guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.

<DESC>Material specification:
This material is needed for large scale trials and evaluations  of various dsRNA constructs previously designed for the purpose of mosquito population control. In the development of RNAi based products, it is normal that adjustments and “fine tuning” will be required to improve efficacy of the initial sequences.

The material is a dual stranded Ribonucleic Acid (dsRNA) specific and predefined sequence of approximately 350 nucleotides long. The exact and complete sequence to be produced (template) will be provided by the USDA/ARS scientists in a standard molecular description. If it will be necessary to produce significantly longer sequences, the vendor may be needed to generate sequences double this size. This template will be used to produce a batch of several grams according to order which will be delivered in cooled buffer solution in concentration of at least 1mg/ml dsRNA 

Quality check that ensures the produced material is to specification will accompany every batch produced and will be a condition and a proof of delivery.  It is understood that the producing a construct to specification does not guarantee efficacy and it is part of the development process which may need consequent batches to be produced in similar process with a new order.

2.  Intended use of items with respect to work involved, project duration, period of performance, and necessity for including specific requirement or characteristics.

Intended Use
The materials will be use exclusively for the research and development of RNAi based mosquito control agent within the USDA/ARS laboratories and under the supervision of  Dr. James Becnel.  Initial batch is expected to be used in the last few months of 2009.  Additional batches may be necessary to be produced before the completion of the project.  This material has not been through the regulatory phase and is not for any commercial use.  Any further development based on the material which intended for commercial use will need the vendors’ certification and active participation in the commercialization process.

From the time of final construct structure sign-of, the production of several grams batch will take on average 60 days and will be delivered on dry ice in express mail services.  Documentation that includes clear storage and handling specifications will accompany each and every batch delivery.


***WORK STATEMENTS CONSULTING @ BLOCK OF 10 HOURS:
1.  What needs to be done?
The following are the consulting services that the project leader can use the vendor’s personal for:
&#61656;	Review and inspect construct development strategy and make recommendations
&#61656;	Inspect proposed sequences’ design vs. silenced target and make                       recommendations
&#61656;	Assist in construct design adjustment as a result of trial analysis
&#61656;	Assist in trial protocol development and their execution
&#61656;	Other RNAi research and development expertise as required

2.  Where should it be done?
All consulting services will be delivered by electronic communication and do not mandate physical presence in the USDA/ARS offices.  However, in case that such presence is required, a special arrangement that include work hours calculations, travel and expenses will be addressed prior to such assignment. In such case, it is understood that all additional expenses will be fully covered by the USDA/ARS. 

3.  What should the final output consist of?
As the consulting services will be directed and used on needed basis by the USDA/ARS staff, these services will be delivered in good faith and to the best of the vendor’s knowledge. The will deliver the sequence but does not guarantee that at the end of the project any product of any kind will be complete or prove to be effective. 

4.  How will the final output be inspected/accepted?
The final product will be tested with protocols that will be developed as part of the entire project. 
dsRNA according to certificate of analysis.

Service will not include hydrostatic testing of tanks and hoses but shall include replacement of parts (e.g., valve stem, O-ring &amp; spring, pull-pins chains, hose gaskets, dust &amp; nozzle holder, etc.) as necessary.

This will allow March ARB fire department personnel to economically deliver and pick-up fire extinguishers in batches of 10 fire extinguishers at a time. March ARB will then swap 10 for 10 fire extinguishers upon completion of the service that would allow only 20 fire extinguishers to be out of service at any given time.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-03-H-5000-6001 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form).

If multiple awards are made it will be for an entire event; therefore, you are required to price or indicate, not separately priced, for each requirement per event.  The contractor is not prohibited from utilizing multiple facilities to meet the requirements, but pricing shall be submitted by one facility. For example, a sister hotel may be utilized to lodge attendees and a separate venue may be utilized for the conference space. If multiple facilities will be utilized to meet each events requirements, all facilities shall be located within ten (10) miles of each other and the cost to provide government transportation to and from each facility will be calculated, by the government, into the overall cost of the event(s).  For purposes of price evaluation, if there is a mathematical error in which the unit price multiplied by the quantity does not equal the extended total, the unit price will prevail and be used for evaluation and award purposes.  Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Should any term or condition (i.e. number of hours prior to event attendee may cancel reservation, etc.) be altered, offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the governments best interest to accept the proposed alternative. In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided.  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rates proposed by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable offer.  As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint&.All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to the time and date scheduled for receipt of quotes.  Questions can be sent via email, rebecca.fowler@us.army.mil or fax (434) 298-6202. Quotes are due not later than 5:30 p.m. ET, Tuesday, January 5, 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br />**************************************************************************************<br />Purchase Request Number: F3W7149244A001 Request for Proposal. This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.<br />**************************************************************************************<br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation (available from http://farsite.hill.af.mil)
<p>52.212-1 - INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2008)</p>
<p>52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A purchase order will be issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror representing the best value to the Government. An evaluation of "Technically Acceptable" will be assigned when the minimum acceptable criteria are clearly met by the proposal and the offeror meets the performance and technical capability requirements defined in the SOW.</p>
<p>Candidate resumes are required to be submitted with proposals. Interviews may be conducted to supplement the information contained in the resumes and proposals. The Government also reserves the right to require the candidates to create and submit sample(s) of work concerning a particular topic related to the SOW requirements as determined by the customer. Proposal must be submitted on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>-- After determining that a complete and acceptable proposal has been received in accordance with the requirements documented in 52.212-1, offers shall initially be ranked according to price, as identified under the Description of requirement above. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified by the proposed unit price for each Item to confirm the extended amount. The price evaluation process will document the completeness and reasonableness of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>--Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>Resume: Resumes submitted will be evaluated to determine if the employee meets the requirements indicated in the SOW. If the offeror is the sole employee, only the offeror's resume is required. If the offeror is a company proposing a staffing relationship, a resume for any/all employees intended to fill the position is required.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Offerors shall complete Attachments 2A and 3A, the Schedule of Supplies/Services and Prices for every line item in either or both solicitation Attachments 2A and 3A, Metal and Embroidery Insignia Items. Contract line item number (CLIN) item 00096 for Hat Device Officer ST/Band does not currently have a specification and will not be used in the price analysis in order to keep all Offerors equal. The Offerors shall complete the escalation factors for option years in Attachments 2B and 3B, Option Pricing Escalation Factors. Attachments 2B and 3B are formulated to calculate the total offered pricing for each option year and the total offered value less CLIN item 00096. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />Technical Capability is of equal importance to relevant past performance. When combined, technical capability and relevant past performance are more important than price; however as offers become more technically equal, price could become a determining factor. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.</p>
<p>(c) Written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>"Person, domestic, and foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;<br />(ii) options;<br />(iii) contracts to acquire stock;<br />(iv) convertible debt instruments; and<br />(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS <br />(JUN 2006) <br />(a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: <br />(1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); <br />(2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated <br />by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); <br />(3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and <br />(4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures. <br />(b) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. <br />(c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. <br />(e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. <br />(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any information technology resources not expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved in writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved. <br />(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). <br />(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access. <br />(k) Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department's Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees.

S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State; <br />(2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U. S. citizen; and <br />(3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government. <br /><br />(l) Contractors shall identify in their proposals the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work under the contract. Any additions or deletions of non-U.S. citizens after contract award shall also be reported to the contracting officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

Proposals shall be submitted per instructions found in Instructions to Offerors of this solicitation (FAR 52.212-1)<br /><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The extension will increase the current contract value   and extend the period ofperformance for a period of six months, from January 1, 2010, through June 30, 2010. Theextension will consist of a three and a half month base period, (1) one and half monthoption, and (1) one month option.   The current contractor, Planners Collaborative, Inc.,is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension. Award to another source at the same time the recompetitionof the follow-on is in process, would result in substantial duplication of cost to theGovernment that is not expected to be recovered through competition of the extension andwould not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity ofservices and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.   2.  The due date for responses is December 22, 2009. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is for lodging and incidental services in Atlantic City, NJ.    The award will be a fixed price contract with a period of performance from 21 Jan 10  24 Jan 10.  The contractor shall furnish all personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, services, and materials, as noted in the solicitation and Statement of Work.  Specific tasks may include lodging, buffets, audio visual equipment, breakout rooms, and light refreshments.  This acquisition is unrestricted under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721120 and an alternate NAICS of 721110, size standard of $7 Million.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to questions received.
SF330 Form, Formats, Page #s
1Q:  Would you accept a SF330 for this project for Electrical Engineering services only?  
1A:  The selected contractor will be responsible for the entire scope of the services. Consequently, a SF330 addressing only one of the disciplines will probably not be considered technically acceptable.
2Q:  A 50 page limit on this SF 330 is a small page count level for such a comprehensive list of needs. Would NAFVAC consider increasing the page count to 75 pages?2A:  Page limit has been increased to 75 by this amended synopsis.  The page limitation now applies only to Part I (excluding past performance evaluations, letters of recommendation or accommodation, and small bushiness past participation information (e.g. SF295 or eSRS summay reports).
3Q:  The Pre-solicitation states that SF 330 Part II is limited to one page for the prime contractor and one page for each subcontractor. Can NAVFAC please confirm that this is one page per prime contractor and each subcontractor regardless of the number of branch offices from the prime contractor and any subcontractor(s) that have a key role on the team? 3A: Yes.
4Q:  Can NAVFAC please confirm that the Navy wide SF 295 that is required to be submitted with the SF 330 is not considered an attachment to the SF 330 and therefore is not included in the 50 page limit of SF 330 Part I?4A:  As indicated above, the SF 295 is not counted against the 75 page limitation.
5Q:  It is not clear from the Pre-Sol if you are requesting one page resumes on the capabilities of our staff or instead a matrix of qualifications stated in your selection criteria (1) Professional Qualifications. Are you looking for both resumes and this matrix? If you are only looking for this matrix and not resumes, would we put this matrix in Section E of the SF 330, or in Section H ?5A.  Both the summary matrix of professional qualifications and resumes are required in Section E of the SF330.6Q:  Reference selection criteria "(1) Professional qualifications" which states, "Submit a matrix for proposed design team(s)."  Please confirm this matrix is to be included in Section H.
6A:  See answer to question 5 above.
7Q:  Selection Criteria (3) Past Performance requests letters of recommendation from clients. To reduce page count can we show excerpts in a matrix that provided the additional information requested?7A:  Only letters of recommendation from clients will be considered and not a matrix showing excerpts of information.  Additionally, please note that letters of recommendation are excluded for the page limitation.
8Q:  If we use an 11 inch X 17 Inch foldout for the professional qualification Matrix, would this be considered as 1 page or 2 pages?8A:  One page  
9Q:  Acceptable Electronic Formats & Page Limits - RFP indicates Word and Excel. We suggest that it might be easier to maintain document integrity (format, page size, font, etc.) in Adobe Acrobat? We have a concern that sending a Word document that the pagination might go off on another system and our proposal maybe considered non-compliant because it could go over the page limit.
9A.  If this is a concern, suggest submitting both a PDF version to maintain document integrity and a Word or Excel version.
10Q:  Would the selection committee allow us to submit uneditable PDFs electronically on disks in lieu of Word and Excel files?
10A.  Please see answer to question 9 above.
11Q:  The Presolicitation notification requires the SF 330 submission be provided in Word 98 (or latest version) and Excel 5.0 (or latest version). Since the SF 330 Part IIs are signed documents, can we provide those in a secure pdf format?
11A:  Yes  
12Q:  Page 3, Section (1) Professional Qualifications - The solicitation calls for a matrix for the proposed design team(s) and asks for specific information to be included in the matrix.  Much of this information is also to be included in the resumes in Block E of the SF330.  Given the page limit for Part I of the SF330, duplication of this information limits the offeror's ability to address other aspects of their qualifications.  Please refine the solicitation requirements to eliminate this duplication of information.
12A.  See answer to question 5 above.
13Q:  The synopsis indicates, "SF 330, Part II is limited to one page for the prime contractor and one page for each subcontractor."  As a prime contractor, we have more than one Part II based on how our internal business units (including staffing resources) are aligned.  Can the presolicitation be modified to remove the page limitation for Part II's so that all Offerors can provide accurate information?
13A:  Part II is excluded from the page limitation as indicated above.  
14Q:  The purpose of this e-mail is to seek clarification concerning the SF 330, Part II that is required for subject solicitation.  In the solicitation information it states the "SF 330, Part II is limited to one page for the prime contractor and one page for each subcontractor."  
In the SF 330, Part II, the first instruction states "to prepare part II for the specific branch office seeking work if the firm has branch offices." We typically prepare the Part II in this manner and not for the overall firm.  Will you reconsider allowing us to submit Part II for each branch office that we plan on using for this contract?
14A.  One general qualification, SF330, Part II is preferred.  However, offerors may submit one Part II for each branch office. 
15Q:  Will the preliminary subcontracting plan be included as part of the 50 pages?  
15A:  No.   
16Q: Are the letters of commendation included in the 50 page limitation?  Can other official correspondence from clients such as email be included? 
16A:  Letters of commendation are not counted in 75 page limit.  The correspondence provided to support qualifications is left up to the offeror. 
17Q:    Will the cover/transmittal letter be counted against the 50 page limit?   
17A:    No
18Q:  Listings of ".total dollar values of contracts awarded and their projected completion schedules" and ". all excellent performance ratings and letters of commendation." are required.  These lists can be lengthy and may limit  a contractor's ability to present their qualifications in sufficient detail to allow the selection committee to make a careful determination of a contractor's qualifications. Would you consider NOT counting these in the 50 page limit - perhaps allowing us to put these lists in an appendix?
18A:  Instead, the synopsis is revised to limit previous contract award/volume of work up to 25 contracts of similar size/complexity. 
19Q:  Similarly, the Navy SF295 is also required and apparently is included as part of the 50-page limit.  Can this report also NOT be included in the 50 page limit and perhaps placed in an appendix?
19A:  Yes, see previous response
20Q:  SF-330 Part IIs are normally provided for each office/branch that contributes personnel to a contract.  However, as presently worded, the solicitation only asks for ONE page/(assume Part II) from the prime and each subcontractor.  Is this correct and, if so, is there a preferred office (ie Headquarters) whose Part II we would provide?
20A:  See answer to question 14 above.
21Q:  Can we identify the photos by the name of the project (or Photo #) without it counting as a page? 
21A:  Yes, however only one photo page per project.
22Q:  If we include Charts such as an Energy Data Trends (Component 3) without any text except to identify the project, will that be considered like a photo and NOT count as a page?
22A:  The chart will not count as a page.
23Q:  We typically include a Submittal Matrix identifying the Components of the Requested Information with the page # referenced where it can be found similar to a Table of Contents or an Index.  Will this count as a page?
23A:  No.

Past Performance:
24Q:  How important is previous DOD experience in the evaluation? 
24A:   Offerors will be evaluated based on the factors in the solicitation which are listed in descending order of importance.
25Q:  Not all parties of our team currently have Past Performance Evaluation (PPE) reports with Dun & Bradstreet (with the exception of one of our partners).  Is it a requirement to have PPEs in place for all teams members?  Or can we supply a mix of Letters of Commendation from some and PPEs from the others?
25A:  Evaluation will be of the entire team.  The mix of information provided is left up to the offeror to support qualification.
26Q:  Past Performance, Selection Criteria 3, requests a list of all excellent performance ratings. Should these projects be related just to our energy services work? Should the letters of commendation be limited to the 10 featured projects in Section F?
26A:   The Government is looking for performance ratings on projects that are of a similar size/scope to what is anticipated in this package.  The mix of letters is left up to the offeor.
27Q:  Reference selection criteria "(3) Past Performance" which states, "Provide a listing of all excellent performance ratings and letters of commendation from both private and DoD clients."  Can Offerors include other Federal clients besides DoD in the listing? 
27A:  See previous response
Subcontracting 28Q:  Page 3, Section (4) Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan - Where can we find "the published Small Business Subcontracting Program?"
28A:  Go to https://smallbusiness.navfac.navy.mil
29Q:  Page 3, Section (4) Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan - The solicitation calls for the firm to "identify" the subcontracting program.  Please clarify how the firm should present this identification.
29A:  See answer above30Q:  How flexible are their SBE participation requirements? It is difficult to develop an SBE plan for projects when the project location and scope of work is unknown.
30A:  The SBE participation requirements are general goals.  Contractors are to identify goals in their subcontracting plans which are specific to this requirement and will be reviewed/approved by the Contracting Officer.
31Q:  Can you share the names of SBE firms that may qualify in order to help us with outreach and due diligence.
31A:  Suggest using Central contractor Registration website at http://www.ccr.gov and resources available through SBA at www.sba.gov.
32Q:  Can Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) team with private contractors for this solicitation?  
32A:  Yes.
33Q:  Regarding: ". Firms, their subsidiaries, or affiliates, which design or prepare specifications for a construction or supply contract, cannot provide the actual construction or supplies on a subsequent contract."  We would like to include one or more firms as subcontractors that will not provide design services or prepare specifications, but they would still contribute in a very meaningful way to this contract.  Can they be included on our team and NOT BE RESTRICTED from providing construction or supplies on subsequent contracts (their roles will be clearly defined)?
33A:  Generally, no.  But refer to the organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause included in solicitation N62583-10-D-0333 which is the proposed Energy MAC contract for OCI exceptions.  
34Q:  If having an overseas presence is important to NAVFAC, we can partner with an engineering firm overseas.  However if we do so, that would not be a qualified small business and we will most likely not meet the 65% small business set aside goal.  For an assignment like this, how much weight is put on meeting the small business goals?
34A:  See weighting of evaluation factors in synopsis.  
Other Questions35Q. Follow up work for installation & construction. This specifically refers to the language found in the RFP."The second component....to support Sustainment, Restoration and Modernization (SRM) and Military Construction (MILCON) projects at DoD facilities."
Will the Prime Consultant or Contractor awarded this contract be excluded from performing any installation/construction work that results from the energy audit and evaluation? What about sub-contractors/consultants of the Prime?
35A:  Probably.  See answer above.  
36Q:  Can you indicate how the submissions will be evaluated? Is there a score for each of the submission components and if so can you share the details of this?
36A:  No.  However, as indicated in synopsis, the most highly qualified firms will be slated, then of those, the most highly qualified firm will be selected for the award. 
37Q:  Would you please explain the sentence ".and the annual size is $27,000,000."
37A:  To be considered small business on this requirement, the firm's average gross revenue for the past three years shall not exceed $27,000,000.00.
38Q:  Does the Navy intend to issue another RFP with the actual solicitation with a revised proposal due date or does this pre-solicitation serve as the actual announcement?
38A:    No, the synopsis is the solicitation and all information needed to submit SF-330 document is contained in this notice.    
39Q:  Is there a specific location where the majority of the work will occur?
39A: No  
40Q:  The document says "various locations worldwide" can you clarify these locations?
40A:  Likely locations are Navy and Marine Corp installations located throughout the world.  
41Q:  Will regional work be awarded to different firms? If so, what are the different sites? 
41A:  The plan is to award one contract, although there is an option for additional awards.  However, the award(s) will not be based geographically.
42Q:  Reference selection criteria "(5) Sustainable Design Requirement" which states, "Identify examples indicating design team (including consultants) experience and concepts employed for sustainability of facilities."  Please confirm this selection criteria pertains to the example projects included in Section F.
42A.  Not necessarily. 
43Q:  Would not having an office overseas (near an existing NAVFAC facility) lower our review score?  
43A:  Not necessarily, refer to stated evaluation criteria. 44Q:  Our firm has 14 offices (800+ employees) in the United States with no offices overseas. Would there be any consideration for NAVFAC to select one (or more) firms to execute projects in the United States and to select one (or more) firms to execute projects overseas?
44A:  At this time, the Government intends to make a single award.  

Request to extend due date?
45Q:  The due date for this solicitation falls immediately after the holidays, effectively requiring that the submittal be delivered to Port Hueneme on December 31 in order to avoid delays or miss-shipments due to the holidays.  Accordingly, considering realistic shipping schedules as well as 3 lost days due to the holidays, we respectfully request that the due date be extended to the following Monday, January 11.
45A.  Request granted.  SF 330s are due 11 January 2010

<DESC>The original synopsis for N61331-10-T-2004 has been modified to include applicable part numbers.  All other terms and conditions remain the same as in the original synopsis.
NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Parvus Corporation 3222 SS. Washington Street, Salt Lake City, UT 84115 on a sole source basis for two (2) Ruggedized Cisco 3825 Integrated Services Routers (PRV-1313-01) and two (2) Ruggedized Cisco 2955 Catalyst Switches (PRV-1312-01).  This item is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. Parvus is the only manufacturer of an off-the-shelf militarized controller that meets MIL-STD-461 and MIL-STD-801 and that meets the minimum performance requirements.   Development time for another vendor to ruggedize this component would take 6-9 months which would have a negative impact on the MVCS project schedule.  In addition this would result in increased cost for another vendor to develop an equivalent unit.  The current system has been design to meet the set requirements stated above.  Any changes to the product will cause a slip in the delivery of the units to the LCS ship 3 and 4 Seaframe.  Software has been designed to utilize current hardware set, affecting development of software with any changes.
The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-10-T-2004.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  The order shall be firm fixed price with the anticipated award date of December 19, 2009.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.
In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT).  EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at https://www.fbo.gov.  Vendors should regularly access this web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

The objective of this study is to provide the NRC with the latest cancer incidence and mortality data for populations living near past and present licensed nuclear power reactors.  This study will give the agency the latest credible scientific information for responding to stakeholders’ concerns related to cancer incidence and mortality in populations that live near licensed nuclear power plants.  Additional analyses will be performed at potential future sites to provide a baseline population cancer risk should a commercial nuclear power reactor be built on the site.

The NRC has determined that the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, operated by the Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), is qualified to provide these services.  ORAU has successfully started work on the epidemiology study.  The NRC would like to indentify potential commercial services to conduct the study before continuing with ORAU. 

In your submittal please provide evidence of the following capabilities: 

1)  Demonstrated ability to interpret and generalize epidemiological results with a large number of statistical tests. Demonstrated experience in developing high quality, technically defensible work products per contractual timelines and within budget. 
 
2)  Demonstrated experience with and knowledge of the availability and accessibility of cancer mortality and incidence databases at the national and State level.  

3)  Demonstrated experience presenting technical information to an independent peer review committee and responding to and incorporating comments.

4)  Demonstrated education and publishing record in the field of radiation epidemiology with a strong preference for investigators at the doctoral level.  Other technical areas critical to the study are biostatistics, geographical information systems (GIS), radiation health effects, and risk communication.

5)  Demonstrated expertise in applying GIS to public health applications. 

6)  Demonstrated experience in database management and in protection of personally identifiable information.

7)  Demonstrated experience in communicating epidemiological results to a diverse range of stakeholders.  Those stakeholders could include the general public living near the licensed reactors, the general public-at-large, interested non-governmental organizations, the media, other Federal, State, and local government agencies, Congress, and the scientific community.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY REPLACES THE ORIGINAL SUMMARY THAT WAS FIRST POSTED 5/27/2009.  THE RESPONSE DEADLINE IS EXTENDED TO 6/19/2009.

SUMMARY REQUIREMENT:
The General Services Administration (GSA) desires to lease between 11,613 rentable square feet (RSF) and 12,774 RSF of office and related space, yielding between 10,098 ANSI/BOMA Office area (formerly usable) square feet (USF) and 11,107 USF of either build-to-suit or existing modern office space.  The space will be occupied by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment.  A minimum of 62 outside/surface parking spaces are required (31 employee; 31 visitor), with employee parking separate from visitor parking.

BUILDING REQUIREMENT:
The facility must be professional in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction.  The space shall be located in a professional office setting and not within close proximity to residential areas, railroad tracks, busy intersections or one-way access roads.  Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare will not be considered in the following instances:  (1) if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within one block; or (2) if access to the location is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks (or an equivalent distance) from the proposed office space.  Locations must be as convenient to the visiting public as possible.  Space shall not be located within a base floodplain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.  For new construction and existing space, a setback of 20 feet is required.

The requested space must be fully serviced, and in a building capable of being altered to meet the Government’s needs and security requirements as well as the Government’s requirements for fire and life safety and handicap accessibility.

UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:
Space shall be on the second floor, shall be contiguous, and on one level without being split by a public corridor or firewalls.  Space must have the potential for efficient layout; columns must be at least 28 feet apart center-to-center, and 28 feet from any interior wall and be no more than two feet square; space should not be “U” or “L” shaped or exceed a length to width ratio of 2:3.  The following space configurations will not be considered:  space with atriums or other areas interrupting contiguous space, extremely long or narrow runs of space, irregularly shaped space configurations, or other unusual building features adversely affecting usage.  Elevator service must consist of a minimum of two industrial, handicap accessible elevators (only one may serve as a freight elevator).

Public transportation, if available, must be within two blocks of the space.  In suburban areas, in small communities and in areas of major cities where adequate public transportation and on site parking are not available, secure vehicle parking facilities MUST be available at reasonable commercial rates for visitors and employees within a two block radius of the space.  Secure parking is defined as parking that meets Federal Protective Service guidelines and should be resolved before any lease is signed.  “Reasonable rates” will be determined by local pricing levels.

In those locations where on site parking is not available, parking for the disabled must be located within the same block.  In addition, GSA will contact local authorities and request the placement of a loading/unloading zone in front of the office for the disabled and other visitors.  A request to GSA will also be made on behalf of disabled employees in those locations where on site parking is not available.

Availability of public transportation, public and commercial parking, and on site parking shall be considered as award factors in evaluating offers, but not as requirements of the Solicitation for Offers (S.F.O).  Locations which meet SSA space requirements and have on site parking for visitors and employees shall be given priority consideration during the process of evaluating offers from potential lessors.

Restricted or metered parking of one hour or less within the two block area of the space does not meet parking requirements.  This is because many SSA contacts with the public cannot be completed within one hour.

Failure to meet the above parking requirements constitutes grounds for rejecting a site.

LOCATION / DELINEATED AREA:
The building offered must be located in Galveston County, TX, within the following boundaries:

North:  FM646
East:  One mile east of I-45
South:  Galveston Island (including the entire island)
West:  One mile west of I-45

LEASE TERM:
The term is for fifteen (15) years, ten (10) years firm.

Expressions of interest should include the following:
Building name and address or, for unimproved sites, provide specific location.
One-eighth scale drawing of space offered or, for unimproved sites, provide site plan and location map.
Confirm BOMA method of measurement, usable yield for available space by floor, and building common area factor.
Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted.

Owners and Authorized Agents:
Brokers and agents may represent prospective landlords, but any properties or proposals submitted by the brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building’s ownership.

Authorized contacts:
In no event shall the offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning the space to be leased with representatives of any Federal Agency other than the officers and employees of the GSA.

Responses to this ad should be received by June 19, 2009 referencing project No. 9TX2150.

<DESC>Synopsis of the proposed maintenance dredging of East Rockaway Inlet Federal Navigation Project, New York<br /><br />The New York District Army Corps of Engineers proposes to perform maintenance dredging of East Rockaway Inlet Federal Navigation Project. The project consists of performing maintenance dredging of the Federal Navigation channel and deposition basin at East Rockaway Inlet with subsequent placement of the dredged material as nourishment along the designated feeder beach (Rockaway). The project is scheduled to be dredged to a depth of 14 feet plus 2 feet allowable overdepth. <br />The proposed maintenance dredging work would involve a Basic Schedule that requires dredging of approximately 110,000 cubic yards of material from the channel with placement at Rockaway Beach. The proposed maintenance would also include an option for dredging of approximately 40,000 cubic yards of material from the deposition basin with placement at Rockaway Beach. <br />The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than thirty five (35) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed. The time for contract completion of the optional work will be determined by allowing a rate of one (1) calendar days for each 12,000 cubic yards of dredged material placed. Therefore, performance period for optional work will be four (4) calendar days, if it is exercised. It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of January and March 2010. The work is estimated to cost over $2,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about November 30, 2009 with bid opening on/about January 5, 2010.<br /><br />Liquidated Damages - $1,528 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract are accepted.<br /><br />This project is being solicited as an UNRESTRICTED procurement.<br /><br />The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a size standard of $20 million.

<DESC>After reconsideration, the Government will continue this procurement as a Design-Build as we only have about a 35% design. This project is O&M funds and not MILCON. MILCON funded projects do not require use of a two phase procurement approach. Being O&M funds with only a 35% design we will revise the solicitation to a two phase procurement process.  The first phase will require a Technical Volume (experience and past performance) and no Price Volume. The second phase will be a Price Volume and Technical Volume (a streamlined technical approach). The plan is to leave the due date the same for the first phase, December 21, 2009, and have the second phase to the short listed offerors Dec 23 with Phase 2 proposals due Tuesday, December 29, 2009.  The goal is to award by December 31, 2009 before funds are pulled.

<DESC>CANCELLATION NOTICE:

Re: Solicitation DJMS-09-R-0015

Court Security Officers Services for the 1st through 12th Judicial Circuits
This is not a solicitation. A written proposal is NOT requested in response to this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to notify potential offerors of the intent of the Unites States Marshal Service to cancel solicitation DJMS-09-R-0015 pursuant to FAR 3.101-1. The solicitation does not accurately reflect the USMS’s requirements as posted.
The release of answers to Solicitation DJMS-09-R-0015 has been delayed, and an amendment to this solicitation would be so substantial as to exceed what prospective offerors reasonably could have anticipated. In an interest to give those offerors adequate time to address this requirement and as to not to preclude those sources who likely would have submitted offers had the substance of the amendment been known to them, this solicitation will be re-advertised.
THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED 12/15/2009.

THE USMS INTENDS TO ISSUE A REPLACEMENT TO THE SOLICITATION.

Please continue checking this site for any further notices. Thank you for your interest in this acquisition.

<p>Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Berik Z. Tolumbayev, Acting General Director<br />KMG Transcaspian LLP, 6 Saryarka Ave.<br />Business Center "Arnan", 7th Floor, Office 735<br />Astana 010000, Kazakhstan, +7 (7172) 793096</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance to</p>
<p>a) assist KMG Transcaspian LLP in defining the International Treaty Accessions, Maritime laws and Regulations that Kazakhstan has to implement and to, <br />b) establish a definition of how these requirements should be implemented.</p>
<p>Kazakh crude oil is currently shipped in limited amounts of approximately 150,000 barrels per day across the Caspian Sea from the Port of Aktau, currently the only major seaport in Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan. Over the next 10 years however, Kazakhstan is expected to dramatically increase oil production, from its current capacity of approximately 70 million tons per year to an estimated 120 million tons per year by 2019. Most of this oil will be exported, necessitating an expansion of Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure. The Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) has prioritized the development of KCTS (Kazakhstan Caspian Transportation System) and in particular the part of KCTS - Transcaspian project (TCP), to ensure that Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure can accommodate rising production levels. Initially, the Trans Caspian System (TCS) is expected to allow Kazakhstan to deliver approximately 500,000 barrels of oil per day directly to Azerbaijan via surface shipments across the Caspian Sea for onward transmission through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, other pipelines are also allowed but beyond the frame of Agreement. This volume is expected to increase to approximately 750,000 to 1.2 million barrels per day when KCTS is fully operational. Improving the safety and environmental management of Caspian Sea ship traffic through improved maritime laws and regulations inspire confidence in TCP. In addition to Aktau, the RK plans to develop the Port of Kuryk as a marine oil loading and transport terminal. Eventually, the RK believes that the majority of oil exported from Kazakhstan via the Caspian will pass through Kuryk rather than Aktau. <br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $327,844 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.
