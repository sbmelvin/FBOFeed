<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE/SYNOPSIS
<p>THIS IS THE FORMAL PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.204</p>
<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA), Joint Base San Antonio Texas, in support of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), is planning to contract with firms to perform environmental services and construction to address environmental needs at Air Force installation locations within the PACAF Region, for which AFCEC customers have responsibility.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts to address environmental needs at PACAF installations and other locations in accordance with technical, legal, and policy requirements. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under task orders at PACAF locations. This is critical to meet AFCEC's future mission and anticipated workload.<br />Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) awards and will have a ceiling of $48.5M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedures will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus three additional years for performance completion.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the Draft solicitation on or about 15 Jan 2016. The Draft solicitation will be issued via FedBizOpps. Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of the Draft solicitation require clarification(s) to permit submittal of a responsive proposal will be required to submit all questions in writing within 10 business days of publication of the Draft solicitation.</p>
<p>The PPI Tool is attached so that you may be able to download the tool to your computer to see how it works. Please see Attachment L-11 for the PPI Tool instructions. Also, please be mindful that versions are occasionally updated, therefore you must use the PPI Tool that will be posted to with the final RFP.</p>
<p>Response to this Draft solicitation is voluntary and will not affect any offeror's ability to submit an offer, if or when, a FINAL Request for Proposal (RFP) is released. This request for feedback is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise that a procurement action will be issued. There is no entitlement for payment by the Government of any direct or indirect costs or charges that arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.</p>
<p>All questions/comments pertaining to the Draft solicitation shall be provided to the Government for consideration in the provided matrix excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet has a field for Section/Attachment Number, Page # / Paragraph Reference and Question/Comment. Please ensure that both sheets and fields are completed in their entirety.</p>
<p>Request industry feedback by noon (Central Standard Time) 2 Feb 2016 to the attention of the Contracting Officer: Katherine.Zapata@us.af.mil and Tracy.Harris.8@us.af.mil. All information provided will become the property of the United States Air Force and will be kept as confidential information.</p>
<p>No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the FINAL RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the FINAL RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the FINAL RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address. Inquiries may be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Since this is a Draft solicitation, please do not send in any proposals. The FINAL RFP, if or when issued, will be available on the Internet at FedBizOpps.gov. As such, it is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any additional information.</p>

The pesticide mixing pad provides a covered concrete surface for filling the spray vehicle pesticide tanks with water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pesticide mixing pad is open to the outside, i.e., there are no walls.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information for T-1A COMBS Support
<SOLNBR>FA8106-t1A
<RESPDATE>020216
<CONTACT>Susan G. Myers, Contract Specialist, Phone 405-734-6494, Email Susan.Myers@US.AF.Mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information -- T-1 COMBS Follow-On</strong></p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This Request for Information (RFI) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.</p>
<p>The AFLCMC/WLZW T-1A office at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) for 178 T-1A aircraft, beginning in FY18, at five (5) CONUS locations. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements or Technical Orders exist. Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer Beechcraft Defense Corporation, Cage 70898 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications.</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 488190, size standard $32.5 mil. The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking to optimize flexibility within the Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) services contract. We are exploring pricing various levels of support into the T-1A COMBS contract as part of this initiative and are seeking industry feedback and ideas on possible contracting options. The goal is to establish a flexible contract that allows the Government to adjust required level of support as needed without driving costs or significantly increasing the risks to the Contractor or the Government. The following scenario is for research purposes only and your candid answers will aid our strategy planning for the T-1A COMBS acquisition. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to the Contract Specialist: Susan Myers, email: Susan.Myers@us.af.mil: (405) 734-6494 or address: 3001 Staff Drive STE 1AE1 104A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020. All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 29 January 2016. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to:<br />ArcticWhite LLC<br />P.O. Box 1452<br />Bethlehem, PA 18016
<p>The purpose of the acquisition is to acquire a quantity of two (2) Porvair Ultravap Mistral 96-well liquid evaporators.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) (1) - only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The Porvair Ultravap Mistral is the only 96-well liquid evaporator capable of 1) shuttling plates from a robotic deck to the drying station; 2) storing 15 custom evaporation programs and 3) safely detecting obstructions and plate alignment on the robotic deck.</p>
<p>The features of the Mistral were designed in cooperation with Hamilton Robotics and Beckman Coulter to directly integrate with the Star and Biomek robots, two robots currently in use in the CDC laboratories. Since the Porvair has a small form factor and shuttling plate design, it can be added to CDC's existing robots without the need for extensive space acquisition and robot reconfiguration.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Arctic White. CDC believes that ArcticWhite is the only source available to provide the equipment that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for quote. A determination to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Ms. Alma Barber via email to vel3@cdc.gov using solicitation number 2016-Q-64647 in the subject line, no later than 4:00pm Eastern Time, January 30, 2016.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>This Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.

This is a Market Survey/RFI. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind. Responses to this Market Survey/RFI will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this Market Survey/RFI. Any costs associated with this Market Survey/RFI submittal is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  

I.	PURPOSE

This Market Survey/RFI is a continuation in a series of announcements regarding the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  Since 2011, the FAA has released the following announcements related to the FFSP:  

1.	Market Survey 11279 - Industry Survey for Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) - November 2011
2.	Market Survey 11872 - Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) - June 2012
3.	Market Survey 12393 - Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) Market Research - FAA/Industry Communication - October 2012
4.	Market Survey 14575 - Flight Service Direct (FSD) - July 2013

The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is to:

	Assess market interest and capabilities to satisfy the requirements for the FFSP
	Solicit industry feedback on draft requirements and FAA questions
	Explore potential business models available to satisfy future flight service requirements
	Assess market interest and capability to deliver flight services via commercial delivery options over time

To assist with vendor responses, the FAA is providing the following attachments:

	Attachment A - Draft FFS Performance Work Statement
	Attachment B - Draft Voice Communication System Requirements
	Attachment C  Question/Comment Response Form

The FAA is also providing the following information via vendor unique KSN Sites:
	Flight Service Traffic Data
	ICD_NADIN
	IRD_OASIS
	IRD_WMSCR
	NESG Users Guide Vol II  External Users  Rev 3

II.	CURRENT DELIVERY OF FLIGHT SERVICES

Currently, FAA flight services throughout the United States are delivered by a combination of the systems and contract vehicles identified below. All the contracts provide services in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.10 Flight Services.

1.	The Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) contract (DTFAWA-05-C-00031), with Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides the full range of flight services to users in the CONUS, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The contract provides certified Flight Service Specialists to deliver preflight, inflight and flight data services to users via telephone and radios.  Lockheed Martin provides personnel, equipment and facilities to provide flight services under the AFSS contract.  The FAA provides Lockheed Martin with access to and use of its air-to-ground radio and telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate inflight communications. In April 2015, the FAA announced its intent to award a single source contract extension for up to 42 months to continue AFSS services to allow time for the FFS contract award and the transition of services.  

2.	The Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) II contracts (DTFAWA-15-C-00035 and DTFAWA-15-C-00036), with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides users with internet-based preflight services (self-briefings and flight plan filing) without the aid of flight service specialists.   

3.	The Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) II contract (DTFAWA-15-C-00006), with Harris Corporation, provides an automation system for the Alaska flight service facilities that enables FAA flight service specialists to provide weather briefing and flight planning assistance to general aviation pilots, as well as, emergency services, law enforcement support, regulatory information and other services. 
 
III.	FFSP MODERNIZATION OBJECTIVES AND PLANNED ACQUISITION STRATEGY

Modernization Objectives

Over the past decade, emerging technologies in communications, personal computing, and mobile device capabilities have provided opportunities to deliver flight service capabilities more efficiently to stakeholders. User preferences and demands are reflected by the continuing decline in the use of human assisted-services as users take advantage of automated and enhanced technologies (e.g., integrated weather products, electronic flight bags) available through the FAA and private sector.  

As part of the FFSP acquisition, FAA is exploring a transformation of its role from a Provider of Flight Services to an Enabler of Flight Services over time.  FAA seeks to obtain information on the feasibility of new Flight Services delivery models where Industry provides flight services through commercial delivery options.  FAA envisions this transformation occurring in a phased approach that considers safety, current requirements, stakeholder acceptance and eases transition to users.  FAA also seeks to establish an appropriate governance structure that ensures the quality of service delivery, meeting safety standards and would be available to all consumers.  FFSP will seek to: 

	Modernize service delivery methods through the use of a contract structure(s) that will encourage and incentivize continuous innovation, improvement, and cost reduction while providing flight services that meet or exceed efficiency and safety objectives.
	Continuously assess and adjust flight services based on changes in user needs and performance feedback.
	Leverage and integrate new technologies as they mature.
	Incorporate FAA Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) capabilities (e.g., Common Support Services  Weather (CSS-Wx), Aeronautical Information Management Modernization  Segment 2 (AIMM S2) and associated data standards (Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM), Weather Information Exchange Model (WIXM), and Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM)) as they become available.
	Provide a flexible, scalable, and net centric Voice Communications System (VCS) using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology enabling communication assets to be addressable and shareable to facilitate business continuity and service delivery objectives.
	Incrementally enable the commercial market to provide flight services delivery options (e.g. electronic flight bags).
  
Planned Acquisition Strategy

The FAA intends to conduct a competition and award one or more contract(s).  The FFS contract(s) will replace the existing AFSS and DUATS II contracts. The FAA anticipates a contract structure that allows for maximum flexibility to adapt to changing conditions to meet user needs.    The FAA anticipates the following:

	Requiring the service provider(s) to provide all facilities, equipment, and personnel to perform preflight, in-flight, and flight data services, as defined in the draft requirements (Attachments A and B). 
	Utilizing contract structure(s) that allow for the modification and/or phased elimination of services with associated cost adjustments over the life of the contract.  
	Utilizing contract structure(s) to incentivize continuous improvement, the integration of new technologies, service optimization, and cost savings/sharing opportunities. 
	Allowing for commercial revenue opportunities (e.g., advertising) if there are cost savings benefits to the Government. 

OASIS II (automation system only) may be incorporated in the scope of FFSP, but does not need to be considered when responding to this RFI.

IV.	INDUSTRY FEEDBACK 

To assist in the development of its acquisition strategy, the FAA is requesting feedback to the questions provided below.  Vendors are encouraged to only respond to questions based upon their capabilities and interest.  A response to every question is not required. Please use all of the Market Survey/RFI attachments and referenced documents for context in responding to the questions.  The FAA also requests Industry comments on draft Attachments A and B and innovative solutions to satisfy the requirements. Please submit all question and comments to the FAA using the attached Question/Comment Response Form (Attachment C).

Vendors must provide written responses. If the FAA determines one-on-one meetings will add value to the market research process, the FAA may elect to conduct meetings with some or all respondents at its sole discretion.

Acquisition Strategy

Draft future flight service requirements, excluding potential OASIS II requirements, are provided in Attachment A  Draft FFS Performance Work Statement.  The FAA is interested in Industry feedback to determine if including the full scope of requirements under one contract creates barriers to competition and the ability to offer innovative solutions.  Industry is requested to provide responses to the following discussion topics/questions:
 
1.	Describe your capability to satisfy the requirements identified in Attachments A and B.
2.	Please discuss any major impediments/risks to achieving FFSP modernization objectives and meeting the draft requirements identified in this Market Survey/RFI. Also, discuss ways you or the FAA might address those identified areas.
3.	What Government Furnished Information (GFI), Government Furnished Property (GFP), and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) are required from FAA to enable your ability to compete for the FFS contract(s)? 
4.	The FAA is seeking to minimize transition cost and to minimize FAA up-front investment to the greatest extent possible. The FAA anticipates the significant transition cost drivers to be the following:
	Establishing a flight service workforce;
	Establishing facilities;
	Developing, integrating and testing voice communications and automation systems; and
	Establishing telecommunications infrastructure to connect to RCO/VOR locations and other EnRoute and Terminal facilities.
Please discuss any ideas you have that would minimize transition costs and provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the transition cost and cost savings associated with the ideas.  What additional GFI, GFP, and GFE would facilitate efficient transition?
5.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of including the full scope of requirements under one contract as described in the Attachment A?
6.	How would your programmatic and delivery options change if the requirements were split into more than one contract?
7.	What business model characteristics should FAA consider to meet Future Flight Services objectives?
8.	The FAA is seeking to increase automation, while continuing to deliver quality services safely and efficiently at reduced costs. What opportunities should the FAA consider to achieve these objectives?
9.	What current or future NAS systems, technologies and/or data access should the FAA provide for service provider use in the performance of the Future Flight Services?  How would access to these systems, technologies and/or data be used in your solution?
10.	What incentive structures should the FAA consider to encourage continuous improvement and cost reduction?
11.	The FAA intends to provide more information about its strategy and requirements.  What additional information would assist you evaluating your interest and eventually responding to a SIR?
12.	If there are other factors the FAA should consider that are not identified in the questions above, please discuss.

Future Commercial Market Capabilities

As part of the overall strategy for FFSP, the FAA is seeking to gain a better understanding of the future marketplace and its ability to provide commercial flight service delivery options over time. Industry is requested to provide responses to the following discussion topics/questions:

1.	Please provide feedback regarding the potential commercialization of some or all of flight services.  Describe any assumptions and constraints that support your feedback.
2.	Describe your current and future ability and the timeframe to provide some or all flight services. FAA is interested in understanding industry capability and interest in providing any subset of the services contained in Attachment A.
3.	Discuss business models you see that would enable you to deliver these services through commercial market opportunities. Discuss the timeframes to implement and any constraints that you anticipate.
4.	Are there any safety impacts or constraints that must be considered based on the business models(s) or service delivery? 
5.	What are some of the considerations FAA should be aware of in order for your firm to make an investment decision to develop the technology/provide services?
6.	What GFI, GFE, GFP are required from the FAA to realize any opportunities mentioned in your response?
7.	Discuss current and future technology to enable Inflight communication other than use of the FAAs RCO network?  Discuss the reliability and affordability of the technology. 
8.	What barriers/constraints would impede your ability to implement commercial service opportunities? 

V.	INDUSTRY DATA REQUEST

The FAA is soliciting Industry input to identify information the FAA can provide to assist respondents in responding to the FFS SIR. Industry can obtain data associated with existing flight service metrics via a FAA SharePoint site that will be provided upon request to each vendor (see Section VI below).

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) NanoFab intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with SPTS Technologies for the purchase of a RF Generator and Match Network for NIST's existing SPTS Omega c2L Rapier Deep Silicon Etch System under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). <br /><br />The NIST CNST supports the U.S. nanotechnology enterprise from discovery to production by providing industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies with access to world-class nanoscale measurement and fabrication methods and technology.<br /><br />The CNST's shared-use NanoFab gives researchers economical access to and training on a commercial state-of-the-art tool set required for cutting-edge nanotechnology development. This world-class shared resource provides researchers with a unique combination of a simple application process, extensive tool and process development, hands-on training, and access to NIST-wide expertise in nanoscience and nanotechnology. <br /><br />The CNST NanoFab has a need for a RF Generator and Match Network to repair the CNST NanoFab SPTS Omega c2L Rapier deep silicon etch system. The SPTS Omega c2L Rapier deep silicon etcher uses a RF Generator to ionize molecules in the etch chamber to create the etch plasma. The Match Network balances the load on the RF generator to provide a constant load while minimizing reflected power which can damage the generator. The etcher cannot be run without the RF Generator and Match network.<br /><br />The SPTS Omega c2L Rapier Deep Silicon Etch System is unique in that it is capable of etching deep features in silicon. The tool uses fast switching Bosch process that produces smooth sidewall profiles while etching silicon up to 30 &micro;m per minute. This tool is critical to the operation of the CNST NanoFab and there is no other type of tool within the CNST NanoFab that has this capability.<br /><br />Without the operation of the CNST NanoFab SPTS Omega c2L Rapier Deep Silicon Etch System, the CNST NanoFab mission is at stake. Due to this system being inoperable researchers both inside and outside of NIST are unable to complete scheduled research undertakings. NIST CNST NanoFab requires this system to operational in order to keep its world-class research facility status. The operation of this system is mission critical. It is an urgent need that this system become operational for the sake of the CNST NanoFab mission.<br /><br />The RF Generator and Match Network supply a high voltage at a high frequency to ionize molecules in the etch chamber of the SPTS Omega c2L Rapier Deep Silicon Etch System. The RF Generator and Match Network are customized by SPTS to work with NIST CNST NanoFab system. The customizations are proprietary to SPTS and it does not make the technology available to any other vendor. No other parts can be substituted.<br /><br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule. This requirement is expected to be awarded in January 2016.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333242 Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing, with a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 10:00 a.m. Eastern on January 19, 2016. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to cory.worley@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Technology Exhibiting Narrow-Spectrum Activity to Target Prevention of Urinary Tract Infections
<SOLNBR>W911QY16XXX03
<RESPDATE>041516
<CONTACT>Jennifer Rego, Ph.D., Phone 508-233-4727, Email jennifer.m.rego.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><div style="text-align: justify;">The US Army Natick Soldier, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is requesting concept papers that address the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) to be proposed under the NSRDEC's Broad Agency Announcement for Basic and Applied Research, Solicitation Number W911QY-15-R-0016 under section VI - Scientific and Technical Areas of Interest, Part C. Warfighter Systems Technologies, Topic Area 6, Biotechnology.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology should specifically target pathogenic bacteria that cause UTIs while rendering the commensal microflora unaffected.  The technology may take the form for use as or development of a hygiene wipe by the Warfighter in the field to prevent the inception of UTIs. The technology should be comprised of a solution-based foundation that includes an agent that exhibits narrow-spectrum activity against UTI causing bacteria, components to enhance stability as well as a wipe textile to serve as the technology platform.  The technology should be evaluated for its range of activity against UTI causing pathogenic bacteria as well as commensal bacteria, propensity of microorganisms to develop resistance towards it, and the stability of the agent over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concept papers should include generalized information to initiate discussions for potential proposal submission for award of a multi-phased research and development contract. These papers should include a description of your efforts to develop narrow-spectrum technology that specifically targets the pathogenic bacteria that cause UTIs and demonstrates no activity against the vaginal commensal bacteria.  Any results arising from your efforts should be summarized and included in the concept paper to demonstrate the intended action and behavior of the technology.  Comprehensive technologies not based on an aqueous solution, such as creams and ointments, will not be considered.  However, the active agent in the cream or ointment may be considered for development in a solution.  Technologies in varying phases of development will be considered.  These may include an individual agent or agents that demonstrate targeted activity against UTI causing microorganisms, a solution-based formulation that incorporates the agent(s) with stabilizing additives to maintain robust activity during long-term storage, and/or a comprehensive technology construct comprised of the agent, solution components and a wipe textile.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is planning to modernize the Information Technology (IT) solutions that currently manage the day-to-day insurance operations of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). As part of these plans, FEMA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to better understand how industry may help in the modernization effort through agile software development expertise; experience with modern web application frameworks; experience with migrating legacy applications and databases to modern infrastructure; user experience/visual design capabilities; and industry-standard open source software frameworks.<br />Specifically, FEMA is requesting industry input in the following areas:<br />&bull; Agile development approaches that have been effective to replace large, legacy solutions with a significant number of interfaces and large data stores (approximately 100TB);<br />&bull; A modular development approach that ensures business continuity for a mixed-financial system such that NFIP day-to-day operations can continue throughout the modernization effort (e.g., claims are still being paid even though the new system may not have a fully developed claims module in the initial phase of the project); and <br />&bull; Best practices and industry expertise related to the replacement/modernization of commercial Property and Casualty (P&amp;C) solutions or other similar insurance solutions (e.g., key considerations, lessons learned, etc.).
<p>This RFI is for research purposes only. Moreover, this RFI will not be used to identify overall industry interest in the NFIP's IT modernization; rather it will be used to understand how agile development methodologies and other industry expertise might be leveraged during the NFIP IT Modernization effort.</p>
<p>This RFI is NOT a request for quotes / proposals. The Government is not responsible for any costs associated with production of this RFI.<br /><br />Information on page 9 under section 4.1 of the RFI must be completed and returned with the response.<br /><br />Phone calls are not accepted.</p>

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing market research to identify the capabilities of firms that can provide technical support to the EPA's Office of Water, Standards and Health Protection Division (SHPD) for developing and approving water quality standards and criteria. The SHPD and its National Branch (NB), and its Regional Branch (RB), have multiple responsibilities under the Clean Water Act of 1987 (CWA), as amended, and the BEACH Act of 2000.  These include directing and overseeing the national program for adoption of water quality standards (WQS) and application of those standards to beach, fish and shellfish monitoring and advisory programs.  In accomplishing this mission, the program provides management strategies, guidance, assessments, technical support and tools for use by States and Indian Tribes in developing their water quality standards programs.  NB and RB also provide programmatic support for the implementation and evaluation of Water Quality Standards (WQS) by identifying, assessing and controlling risks to aquatic ecosystems.  In particular, the required technical support services include the following:  providing technical support to EPA in the development of regulations, policies, and guidance on WQS program development and implementation; assisting EPA in providing and coordinating technical support for development, adoption, and implementation  water quality standards and criteria to States and Indian tribes, including expert support; assisting EPA in establishing priorities for State and Tribal WQS programs; providing support in coordinating regional WQS reviews, approvals and disapprovals and national WQS promulgations; providing support in coordinating WQS information management and analysis; providing program related technical support, outreach, training, education to Regions, States, and Indian Tribes and other stakeholders; providing technical support for implementation of WQS including use attainability analyses, environmental assessments, economic benefit analysis, and total maximum daily load (TMDL) calculations including use of geographic information systems, multi-media environmental fate and transport models, and water quality based permitting; providing technical support for developing and managing cross-media and multi-Agency policies to ensure standards and exposure goals are attainted; and assisting EPA in coordinating policies with our partners in other federal agencies (especially the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service) to insure all legal mandates are met.  
It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost-plus-fixed-fee, term contract.  It is anticipated to provide up to 60,000 professional labor hours over the term of the contract, including the base period and four option periods.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $15 million in average annual receipts. In the capabilities statements, contractors must provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women owned, small disadvantaged and/or service disabled veteran owned concern.  The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (See FAR 52.219 14) under a procurement set aside for small businesses.  

A draft copy of the performance work statement (PWS) is included as an attachment. Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest (COI) under any resulting procurement.  Therefore for informational purposes areas of concerns are identified in the Attachment Draft COI Requirements.  Interested parties with the capability of providing any of the services described in the draft PWS posted at the FedConnect website: https://www.fedconnect.net/ are invited to submit a ten (10) page document, in writing, sufficient information that clearly demonstrates their ability to provide the services described in the draft PWS, including personnel, experience and qualifications.

<DESC>Formerly: https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFSC/SMCSMSC/FA881815R0025/listing.html
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to share with industry changes being considered to the acquisition strategy outlined in the Engineering, Development and Sustainment (EDS) 2016 sources sought synopsis published on 5 Feb 15 (formerly FA8818-15-R-0025) and in the attached EDS Follow-On Industry Days briefing. The Government has changed the program requirement title from EDS 2016 to the Engineering, Development, Integration and Sustainment (EDIS) Contract, solicitation number FA8818-16-R-0023. The Government also intends to obtain industry feedback on the new strategy, industry statements of capability, as well as industry interest in supporting the revised requirements</p>
<p>The EDIS contract will not include Mission Unique Software (MUS)/Application (Apps) development for missions hosted on the Multi-Mission Satellite Operations Center (MMSOC) previously included in EDS. The EDIS requirement includes the integration of R&amp;D and operational mission telemetry, tracking and commanding (TT&amp;C) and the MUS/Apps as necessary. The revised draft Program Objectives is attached for clarity. The Government is seeking information from industry regarding options for MUS/App development and the possible separation of Mobile Range Flight (MRF) support. <br /><br />I. REQUEST FOR STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY (SOC) INFORMATION<br />This pre-solicitation RFI requests two separate statements of capability addressing different sets of requirements which may or may not be combined into one acquisition. Please provide separate SOCs in accordance with the content and format outlined for each area.</p>
<p>A. ENGINEERING, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION AND SUSTAINMENT (EDIS) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The EDIS contract will perform functions as described in the attached, revised Draft Program Objectives. The bulk of the scope will be under the "integration" and "sustainment" areas.</p>
<p>Under EDIS, the MMSOC core development follows a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) with defined standards and standard, government prescribed external interfaces which enable a common operator interface. Consistent with Department of Defense (DoD) Directive (DoDD) 5000.01, Enclosure 1 and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02, Enclosure 3, proprietary and/or unique standards and components will be minimized.</p>
<p>Between FY2017 and 2021, SMC/AD forecasts migrating onto MMSOC five existing Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) major weapon systems, all new AFSPC satellite systems and all new R&amp;D satellite systems which will operate from the Research, Development, Test and Engineering Support Center (RSC).</p>
<p>EDIS will sustain all "MMSOC instances" in a manner consistent with the MMSOC Life Cycle Support Plan (LCSP). A "MMSOC instance" is a single, complete suite of hardware and software installed at a specific site location. EDIS will sustain one or more instances of MMSOC at each of the following locations: Kirtland AFB, NM; Schriever AFB, CO; Buckley AFB, CO. Sustainment at additional sites is possible.</p>
<p><br />SOC SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS FOR EDIS PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>SMC/ADG requests interested sources who can meet the EDIS program requirements respond to this synopsis as follows:</p>
<p>a. For companies that responded to the 5 Feb 15 SSS, please provide an update of the information submitted based on the outline below.<br /><br />b. For companies which did not respond to the 5 Feb 15 SSS, please provide a full SOC (in accordance with the instructions provided in the 5 Feb 15 SSS) and include the information requested below. Page limit for those who did not respond to the 5 Feb 15 SSS will be the sum of the pages allowed for the 5 Feb 15 SOC and the 10 pages allowed for this update.</p>

The information provided will not be part of the request for SOCs but will be used in further defining the evolving EDIS acquisition strategy. Questions to consider are provided in each topic area.</p>
<p>A. ENGINEERING, DEVELOPMENT, INTEGRATION AND SUSTAINMENT (EDIS) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What are the meaningful differences (risks) between supporting major satellite weapon systems versus R&amp;D satellite systems (e.g. cybersecurity)?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What are the inherent risks associated with integrating MUS and Apps not developed by the EDIS contractor? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What are the advantages or disadvantages on the Government's intent to apply MOSA standards as defined in DoDD 5000.02 and DoDI 5000.01 to the design of MMSOC?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o SMC/ADG envisions leveraging the Weapons Systems Sustainment (WSS) program and operational unit sustainment contracts to perform a subset of sustainment as early as the FY2019 time frame. What would be the preferred contract structure to support the transition of MMSOC into the WSS environment? Information should include any contract clauses that might be required.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) mitigations would enable the EDIS contractor to develop MUS and Apps?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Share any examples of Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) templates and attributes which will enable integration.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What do you believe are the appropriate contract type(s) for this effort (Cost vs Fixed type; C-type vs IDIQ)?</p>
<p>B. MISSION UNIQUE SOFTWARE (MUS) AND APPLICATION (APPS) DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Are there existing Government contracts with scope that could be used to develop MUS and/or Apps for AFSPC or R&amp;D satellite systems? Include contract number, period of performance, government agency, and contract POC name/phone number.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o What are the risks associated with using current government contracts and not seeking a dedicated (either Multiple award or single award) SMC/AD MUS/App development contract?</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>This notice is being published by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201 and 5.204 requiring notice of a proposed contract action.</p>
<p>This posting is NOT a request for competitive proposals. The statutory authority for this sole source action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Award is subject to Sole Source Justification approval.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to issue a purchase order to Formulatrix, Inc., 10 Deangelo Drive, Bedford, MA 01730-2204pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)----Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. This requirement will provide a service maintenance agreement for a one year for the Minstrel/Gallery 160 system. The anticipated performance period will be from January 30, 2016 - January 29, 2017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Intramural Research (DIR), utilizes the Minstrel/Gallery 160 system to provide analysis of high crystal resolution. This instrument helps us locate conditions that produced macromolecular crystals to solve high resolution crystal structures. Automation of this process saves a significant amount of time. As well UV inspection (which cannot be done by a normal desktop microscope) helps the NIEHS determine the nature of the crystal allowing research scientists to distinguish between salt (bad) and protein (good) crystals. This saves precious samples as NIEHS scientists do not chase false positives. The service contract will cover the Minstrel DTUV, the Gallery 160 as well as the software required to operate the equipment as well as inspect and organize the data. Moreover, maintaining a service contract for the Minstrel/Gallery 160 system is important for keeping the equipment operational. Crystallization experiments require regular monitoring to determine if crystals have formed. Using the automated system, NIEHS samples are automatically imaged at a regular basis providing important information as to what conditions lead to crystal growth, how long they take to grow and crystal content (whether or not the crystals may be salt). Manual inspections of trays take significantly longer to do and do not provide information as to the content of the crystals themselves. In addition, this robot system performs this task at 4 C eliminating the need for a person to spend hours on end in the cold room as the images can be viewed by computer. If this system goes down it will slow down scientific productivity by reducing the amount of inspections that can be carried out as well as eliminating the acquisition of important information such as length of time it took for crystals to grow and crystal content. Knowledge of crystal content by UV inspection can reduce cost and time associated with chasing false positive crystal hits with precious and expensive samples. Crystallography is the mainstay technique for the Williams, Hall and Stanley labs as well as the X-ray Crystallography Core (Pedersen) that maintains the equipment and uses it for studies for other NIEHS investigators.</p>
<p>This 1-year service contract shall ensure efficient long-term operation of our instrument and uninterrupted service coverage. Formulatrix is the sole source for the licensed selling, maintenance and care of their research/analysis equipment.</p>
<p>This service contract serves to maintain current working status, on-site visits for repair when necessary and software upgrades as needed. Failure to purchase this service agreement will mean that upgrades will not be performed and that service visits will need to be paid upon request, costing thousands of dollars for each visit. This service contract will enable the equipment to operate at optimal levels and generate data comparable to what has been historically produced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This service maintenance agreement at the NIEHS (from January 30, 2016 - January 29, 2017) is in direct support of the Division of Intramural Research and this anticipated action will provide a seamless and fluid transition in terms of maintenance for this critical equipment.<br />This contract action is anticipated in FY 2016.<br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government may consider responses received within fifteen calendar (15) days of this posting.<br />A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capacity to fulfill this requirement. NIEHS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />PO Box 12874<br />Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709 <br />Place of Performance: <br />National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) -- Building 101</p>

Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or Native as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Indian Economic Enterprise means any business activity owned by one or more Indians or Indian Tribes that is established for the purpose of profit, provided that:
(i) The combined Indian or Indian Tribe ownership shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise; (ii) the Indians or Indian Tribes shall, together, receive at least a majority of the earnings from the contract; and (iii) the management and daily business operations of an Indian economic enterprise must be controlled by one or more individuals who are members of an Indian Tribe. To ensure actual control over the enterprise, the individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the enterprise conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods:
(1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation;
(2) At the time of contract award; and,
(3) During the full term of the contract.
Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601).
Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in Subpart 1480.8.
(b) General.
(1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers are solicited only from Indian economic enterprises.
(2) BIA will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises.
(3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause.
(c) Required Submissions. In response to this solicitation, an offeror must also provide the following:

(2) A description of the source of human resources for the work to be performed by the offeror;
(3) A description of the method(s) of recruiting and training Indian employees, indicating the extent of soliciting employment of Indian persons, as required by DIAR 1452.226-70, Indian Preference, or DIAR 1452.226-71, Indian Preference Program, clause(s);
(4) A description of how subcontractors (if any) will be selected in compliance with the Indian Preference or Indian Preference Program clause(s);

(d) Required Assurance. The offeror must provide written assurance to the Indian Affairs that it will comply, or has, complied fully with the requirements of this clause. It must do this before Indian Affairs awards the Buy Indian contract, and upon successful and timely completion of the contract, but before the Indian Affairs Contracting Officer (CO) accepts the work or product.
(e) Non-responsiveness. Failure to provide the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause may cause Indian Affairs to find an offer non-responsive and to reject it.
(f) Eligibility.
(1) Participation in the Mentor-Protg Program established under section 831 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (25 U.S.C. 47 note) does not render an Indian economic enterprise ineligible for contracts awarded under the Buy Indian Act.
(2) If a contractor no longer meets the definition of an Indian economic enterprise after award, the contractor must notify the CO in writing. The notification must include full disclosure of circumstances causing the contractor to lose eligibility status and a description of any actions that the contractor will take to regain eligibility. Failure to give the CO immediate written notification means that: (i) The economic enterprise may be declared ineligible for future contract awards under this part; and (ii) Indian Affairs may consider termination for default if it is in the best interest of the government.

<DESC>Scope of work includes:
1.	New components and the modification of existing components to work with the new components.  
a.	New components include fixed roof sections, operable roof sections, and a long-span roof truss.  
b.	New components are primarily built of tubular steel.

2.	Existing components to be modified include modular towers, fixed roof sections and a long-span truss.  
3.	A majority of the new work will need to be performed off site.  Components are too large to be delivered over land, so barge delivery is anticipated, and will be the responsibility of the Contractor.  
4.	Some modifications will need to be performed with very limited on-site laydown space, while other components requiring modification will require removal from the Shipyard.
  
a.	It is anticipated that these components can be trucked to and from the Shipyard.

The estimated magnitude of work for this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The Procurement Method is Sealed Bidding, FAR Part 14.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 238120 and the annual size standard is $15,000,000.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

INTRODUCTION
This quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the Statement of Work (SOW).  This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines the VA will use in ensuring the required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the contractor. 
Purpose
The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards/quality levels identified in the SOW and the contractor's quality control plan (QCP), and to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services received.
This QASP defines identifies the performance objectives, defines the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describes quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.
Performance Management Approach
The SOW structures the acquisition around "what" service or quality level is required, as opposed to "how" the contractor should perform the work (i.e., results, not compliance). This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by VA to monitor and manage the contractor's performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the SOW are achieved.  Performance management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the contractor. 
Performance management represents a significant shift from the more traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as safety and health. A "results" focus provides the contractor flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the contract as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired performance levels are being met.
Performance Management Strategy
The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The contractor measures that quality through the contractor's own quality control (QC) program. QC is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work performed under this contract regardless of whether the work is performed by contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor's QCP will set forth the staffing and procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements in the SOW.  The contractor will develop and implement a performance management system with processes to assess and report its performance to the designated government representative. The contractor's QCP will set forth the staffing and procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements in the SOW. This QASP enables the government to take advantage of the contractor's QC program.  
The government representative(s) will monitor performance and review performance reports furnished by the contractor to determine how the contractor is performing against communicated performance objectives. The government will make determination regarding incentives based on performance measurement metric data and notify the contractor of those decisions. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is managed effectively.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Contracting Officer
The contracting officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the contracting officer's representative (COR) and the contractor. The CO will designate one full-time COR as the government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors depends on the complexity of the services measured, as well as the contractor's performance, and must be identified and designated by the CO.
The Contracting Officer's Representative 
The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is designated in writing by the CO to act as his or her authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter. The COR is responsible for technical administration of the project and ensures proper government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor deems may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the CO for action.  The COR will have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms used to document the inspection and evaluation of the contractor's work performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to the contract.

IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS/QUALITY LEVELS
The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the SOW and in Attachment 1, "Performance Requirements Summary." 
Positive or Negative Incentives in Relation to Standards and Quality Levels
Contractor performance on this contract, be it less than, greater than or equal to satisfactory performance on this contract, will be subject to the Positive and/or Negative Incentives identified in the Performance Requirements Summary. The results will also be documented by the COR and CO, for use as past performance indicators to support any interest or bids the contractor makes in future government requirements and solicitations. Failure to meet the required service or performance level will result in a delinquency notice to the contractor.

METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE
Surveillance Techniques
In an effort to minimize the performance management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The primary methods of surveillance are: 
"	Random monitoring - which shall be performed by the COR/COR designated inspector.
"	100% Inspection - Each month, the COR, shall review the generated documentation and enter summary results into the Surveillance Activity Checklist.
"	Periodic Inspection - COR typically performs the periodic inspection which should align with the frequency of required services per the SOW, such as weekly or monthly, depending on the required task.
"	Customer Feedback 
The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer complaints. 
Performance management drives the contractor to be customer focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the CO and COR, as opposed to the contractor. 
Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be forwarded to the COR. The COR will accept those customer complaints and investigate using the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form - Customer Complaint Report, identified in Attachment 3.
Customer feedback may also be obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. 
Acceptable Quality Levels 
The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 1, Performance Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing negative incentives for performance shortfalls. 

QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION
The Performance Management Feedback Loop 
The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the SOW and are assessed using the performance monitoring techniques shown in Attachment 1.  
Monitoring Forms 
The government's QA surveillance, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using the monitoring forms in Attachments 2, 3 and 4. The forms, when completed, will document the government's assessment of the contractor's performance under the contract to ensure that the required results satisfy the Purpose of the SOW.  
The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA surveillance forms and forward electronic copies to the CO. 

ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT
Determining Performance 
Government shall use the monitoring methods cited to determine whether the performance standards/service levels/AQLs have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum requirements, it may be asked to develop a corrective action plan to show how and by what date it intends to bring performance up to the required levels. Failure to meet the AQL may result in deduction of monies, as shown in Attachment 1 of this document, or other incentives (positive or negative) or penalties may result.  
Reporting
At the end of each month, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance surveillance of the contractor's performance.  This written report, which includes the contractor's submitted monthly report and the completed quality assurance monitoring forms (Attachment 2, 3 or 4), will become part of the QA documentation.  It will enable the government to demonstrate whether the contractor is meeting the stated objectives and/or performance standards, including cost/technical/scheduling objectives.
Reviews and Resolution
The COR may require the contractor's project manager, or a designated alternate, to meet with the CO and other government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss performance evaluation.  The COR will define a frequency of in-depth reviews with the contractor, including appropriate self-assessments by the contractor; however, if the need arises, the contractor will meet with the COR as often as required or per the contractor's request.  The agenda of the reviews may include:
"	Monthly performance assessment data and trend analysis
"	Issues and concerns of both parties
"	Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends, including a corrective action plan analysis
"	Recommendations  for improved efficiency and/or effectiveness
The COR must coordinate and communicate with the contractor to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal or unacceptable performance. 
The COR and contractor should jointly formulate tactical and long-term courses of action.  Decisions regarding changes to metrics, thresholds, or service levels should be clearly documented. Changes to service levels, procedures, and metrics will be incorporated as a contract modification at the convenience of the PCO/ACO.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.<br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.<br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]<br />(5) <br />(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-<br />(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or<br />(B) Terminate this contract for cause.<br />(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.<br />(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--<br />(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or<br />(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.<br />(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to correct or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.<br />(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.<br />(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation.

The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.<br />(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.<br />(10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.<br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.<br />(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a) (4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:</p>
<p>FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - <br />VARIATION<br />The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and<br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>

<p>(iii) contracts to acquire stock;</p>
<p>(iv) convertible debt instruments; and</p>
<p>(v) others similar interests.</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS WASTE</p>
<p>Contractors performing dockside ship repair work at Government facilities are required to comply with<br />FAR 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data (JAN 1997) Alt I, the U.S. Coast Guard shipboard hazardous waste policy, as prescribed in COMDINST M16478.1B, and MLCA standard specifications. Disposal of all hazardous wastes shall be performed by the Contractor and the Contractor shall meet all federal and state requirements. The Contractor is also required to submit an acceptable hazardous waste management plan to the Port Engineer at the Arrival Conference. The plan will be reviewed by the facility hazardous waste manager. An acceptable plan must address, at a minimum, the following requirements:<br />(a) EPA and local authority hazardous waste generator ID numbers or registration of the Contractors, his transporters, and disposal facilities (TSDFs);<br />(b) An inventory of all hazardous chemicals, compounds and other agents brought aboard the facility accompanied by their respective Material Safety Data Sheets;<br />(c) A list of all anticipated hazardous wastes to be generated and a federal/state/local regulation cross reference list for those wastes;<br />(d) Waste collection and containment procedures;<br />(e) A hazardous material spill and cleanup plan including tools and materials that will be on hand and readily available to facility containment and cleanup;<br />(f) Training certification for the Contractor's hazardous waste manager.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(g) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(h) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award:</p>
<p>1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>

<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3.

<p>The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(k) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(l) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the Quotation includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the Quotation.</p>
<p>(m) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor and shall be included in the Composite Labor Rate. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>

<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(n) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee);<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:</p>
<p>Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security<br />Testing <br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(o) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(p) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect</p>
<p>to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed.</p>
<p>2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award.

Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS (OPAP) WAS ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AGENCY PROTEST ISSUES AND RESOLVE THEM WITHOUT EXPENSIVE AND TIME- CONSUMING LITIGATION. OPAP IS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEWING AUTHORITY THAT IS EMPOWERED TO GRANT A PREVAILING PROTESTER ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RELIEF AS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO).
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS WITHIN THE USCG AS AN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FORUM RATHER THAN FILING A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR SOME EXTERNAL FORUM. INTERESTED PARTIES MAY SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS INFORMALLY OR OPT TO FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR OMBUDSMAN.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. INTERESTED PARTIES WHO BELIEVE A SPECIFIC USCG PROCUREMENT IS UNFAIR OR OTHERWISE DEFECTIVE SHOULD FIRST DIRECT THEIR CONCERNS TO THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTING OFFICER. IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IS UNABLE TO SATISFY THEIR CONCERNS, INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THE U.S. COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN FOR AGENCY PROTESTS. UNDER THIS INFORMAL PROCESS THE AGENCY IS NOT REQUIRED TO SUSPEND CONTRACT AWARD PERFORMANCE. USE OF AN INFORMAL FORUM DOES NOT SUSPEND ANY TIME REQUIREMENT FOR FILING A PROTEST WITH THE AGENCY OR OTHER FORUM. IN ORDER TO ENSURE A TIMELY RESPONSE, INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO THE OMBUDSMAN: SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NUMBER, CONTRACTING OFFICE, CONTRACTING OFFICER, AND SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE (IF APPLICABLE).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. PRIOR TO SUBMITTING A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST, PROTESTERS MUST FIRST USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THROUGH OPEN AND FRANK DISCUSSIONS. IF THE PROTESTER'S CONCERNS ARE UNRESOLVED, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS AVAILABLE BY THE OMBUDSMAN. THE PROTESTER MAY FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST TO EITHER THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, THE OMBUDSMAN UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM. CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE WILL BE SUSPENDED DURING THE PROTEST PERIOD UNLESS CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE IS JUSTIFIED, IN WRITING, FOR URGENT AND COMPELLING REASONS OR IS DETERMINED IN WRITING TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO RESOLVE PROTESTS IN LESS THAN 35 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FILING. PROTESTS SHALL INCLUDE THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN FAR 33.103(D) (2). IF THE PROTESTER FAILS TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION, RESOLUTION OF THE PROTEST MAY BE DELAYED OR THE PROTEST MAY BE DISMISSED. TO BE TIMELY PROTESTS MUST BE FILED WITHIN THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN FAR 33.103(E). FORMAL PROTESTS FILED UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO OPAP@USCG.MIL AND THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR BY HAND DELIVERY TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.</p>
<p>ELECTION OF FORUM. AFTER AN INTERESTED PARTY PROTESTS A COAST GUARD PROCUREMENT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR THE OMBUDSMAN, AND WHILE THE PROTEST IS PENDING, THE PROTESTER AGREES NOT TO FILE A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR OTHER EXTERNAL FORUM. IF THE PROTEST IS FILED WITH AN EXTERNAL FORUM, THE AGENCY PROTEST WILL BE DISMISSED.</p>

The provision at FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014), applies to this acquisition. 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors in descending order of importance shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1. Technical: Offeror must meet the following technical criteria: 

(a)  Offeror shall be a certified expert for monitoring and reporting to fulfill the SOW requirements;
 (b)  Offeror shall have the ability to provide same level of monitoring services for all devices in all premises;
(c) Offeror shall  provide clear uninterrupted signal for all monitoring devices;
(d) Offeror shall provide instant reporting to local authorities, to include fire;
(e) Offeror shall provide monitoring services - 24 hours day/ 7 days a week/ 365 days of the year;
(f) Offeror shall communicate alarm activities to VAPD, COR, and designated clinic staff;
(g) Offeror shall  reports of trouble signals to COR the following business day;
(h) Offeror shall provide monthly inspections on all devices, to include duress buttons. Reports sent to COR; and 
(i) Offeror shall provide monthly user reports to the COR

2. Past Performance: 
Past performance will be evaluated after the technical evaluation.  The Contracting Officer, reserves the right to exclude offerors whose technical submittals have been determined to be unacceptable from further evaluation of past performance and price.  Additionally, in the event a offeror submits a technically acceptable quotation with a non-competitive, high price when compared to the government estimate and/or other technically acceptable proposals, the Government, at its discretion, may not evaluate that offeror's past performance submission and eliminate that offeror's proposal from further evaluation and consideration for award.

a)	The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 12.206 and FAR subpart 15.3 as applicable.  The Government will determine whether the offeror's past performance submissions are relevant based on two factors: scope and magnitude.  Past performance will be evaluated with the following sub-factors, which are of equal value: (1) customer service/satisfaction and (2) Ability to respond to emergencies.  Evaluation of this factor will be based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance relating to contracts of comparable size, scope, technical complexity and work performed.  The evaluation of past performance using these sub-factors is a comparative analysis and only one of multiple criteria to assess which offeror represents the lowest performance risk and the best value.

b)	Offerors shall submit three references with contact information and explanation of the scope and magnitude with details explaining the three sub-factors for each specific contract.  The most recent relevant references will be weighted most heavily in the evaluation.  For each reference submit the following: Contract type; Contract number, Contact information for the references in both program office and contracting, description of the work, dollar value, award and completion dates, and problems and challenges encountered with actions taken to correct the situations.

c)	For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the offeror or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The offeror acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the offeror fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Offerors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including the Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS) and sources outside of the Government, 

d) The Government will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk and regulatory vulnerability.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a offeror's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  The adjectival ratings that will be used to establish performance risk will be generally correlated with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 


1.	Highly Acceptable (Very Low Performance Risk):  Based on the offeror's performance record, very little doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.  

2.	Acceptable (Low Performance Risk):  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

3.	Unacceptable (High Performance Risk):  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  

e) Neutral:  Unknown performance risk assessment.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the submittal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the quotes of other offerors having an acceptable (or better) past performance. 

3. Price: Price will be evaluated for its fairness and reasonableness. 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(d) Technical factors are more significant than price. Offers will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government, all factors considered.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued 1/4/16 to correct the location of the pre-proposal conference/site visit to be held on January 6, 2016 and update a clause in Section C of the SIR/RFO.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for GNS Building Skylight and Roof Replacement at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, OK.  All work shall be accomplished in accordance to the project specifications and drawings.  

The work to be accomplished under this contract consists of recoating of existing roofing material and replacement of existing skylights/explosion proof vents.

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed-price type construction contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-01821 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes an evaluation of past performance.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(f)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.

This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 238160 Roofing Contractors.  The business size standard for this NAICS is $15 million.

A pre-proposal conference/site visit will be held on January 6, 2016 at 10:00 a.m. CST in conference room 122 of the GNS Building (Building No. 195) at the MMAC, Oklahoma City, OK.

Guards at the Security Command Center will direct attendees to the GNS Building.  Service trucks will need to enter through the Commercial Entrance on SW 74th Street.  

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS/PLANS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 13, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 20, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency re-releases the Draft Requests for Proposal (RFP), solicitation number HQ0147-16-R-0008, for the Agency's "Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Cybersecurity Management / Computer Network Defense (CSM/CND)" contract under the Technical, Engineering, Advisory, and Management Support (TEAMS) acquisitions.
<p><br />MDA encourages industry input, comments, and questions to identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition and to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities. In particular, MDA is interested in industry comments related to two specific areas: BMDS Knowledge and Small Business participation. Industry questions from the initial Draft RFP revealed a perception the Agency required specific BMDS knowledge to accomplish some of the planned tasks. This is not the Agency's intent and Sections L-12 and M-9 have been modified to address this concern. Additionally, industry questioned realism and achievability of the Small Business subcontracts requirement in the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Section L-9.1). Questions and/or comments in either these sections, or any other aspects of the Draft RFP are due to MDA no later than 1700 Central Time on January 29, 2016 and may be submitted to TEAMS_CSM-CND@mda.mil, subject line "TEAMS BMDS CSM/CND RFP." Please use the RFP attached BMDS CSM CND Industry Questionnaire Template to submit questions and/or comments. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).</p>
<p>This draft solicitation is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreements or arrangements. This announcement is for information planning purposes only and proposals are not requested. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of services. This announcement does not constitute a solic9itation or a promise of a solicitation in the future.</p>
<p>Questions concerning this special notice should be addressed to Ms. Michaela Simmons at TEAMS_CSM-CND@mda.mil.</p>

<CONTACT>Welch, Sarah
<DESC>Request for Quotations #P16PS00340 is for archaeological services on Ross Lake National Recreation Area, WA.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) will hire one or two contractors to conduct archeological studies at three pre-contact-age archeological sites in the drawdown of Ross Lake (reservoir).  This work is authorized by the 1991 settlement agreements entered into by the City of Seattle (City) and the National Park Service (NPS) to meet licensing requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and NPS cultural resources management policies as these relate to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and its amendments.  The tasks and sites are: Archeological Data Recovery Excavation at 45WH268 N. Lightning Creek #4; National Register evaluation of 45WH441 South East Landing #2; and Archeological Data Recovery Excavation at Site 45WH262, Devil's Junction Creek #2.  Field season will be during the annual drawdown of the reservoir, approximately April through June, 2016, depending on reservoir depth.  The final report will be due in February, 2017. 
NPS reserves the right to make multiple awards and plans to award one or two firm-fixed-price contracts for the work.   We prefer to award one contract if the contractor has sufficient capacity to perform all work at all sites within the 2016 anticipated annual drawdown period.  Refer to the RFQ clauses for details.
PROJECT LOCATION:  The three sites are located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by NPS.  There is no direct car access to any of the sites and access logistics are challenging.  The sites are on the unvegetated reservoir bottom (drawdown zone) where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air during annual lowering of the reservoir level.  Full pool elevation of the reservoir is 1602.5 feet above sea level (ft asl) and the site elevations are approximately 1540, 1550, and 1570 ft asl.  Maps and information about the park are at www.nps.gov/NOCA and www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/boating-on-ross-lake.htm.       
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 541720, Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities and the small business size standard is $20.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The solicitation and award processes will use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and reference the Service Contract Act.
All eligible responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the National Park Service; however quoters who have not established and/or maintained an active registration and completed the online representations and certifications at www.SAM.gov prior to the response due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award. 
Prospective quoters will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the solicitation documents; no notifications will be sent nor will hard copies of the solicitation be mailed or issued.   Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.FBO.gov without registering, however, registered vendors may use FBO's Interested Vendors List and Watchlist.  Registering also provides opportunity to receive notifications, which is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance.

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p><strong>Brief description of the current program / effort:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Overview / Purpose / Description of Procurement:</strong> The Global Command and Control System - Joint is the Department of Defense (DoD) joint Command and Control (C2) system of record for achieving full spectrum dominance. It is a suite of mission applications that provides critical joint warfighting C2 capabilities and is the principal foundation for dominant battlespace awareness, providing an integrated, near real-time picture of the battlespace necessary to conduct joint and multinational operations. GCCS-J provides a robust and seamless C2 capability to the Commander-in-Chief (CINC), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), National Military Command Center (NMCC), Combatant Commanders (CDRs), Joint Force Commanders, and Service Component Commanders. GCCS-J offers vital connectivity to the systems the joint warfighter uses to plan, execute, and manage military operations.</p>
<p><strong>2. Scope of Effort: </strong>The GCCS-J program office is seeking information for the modernization and development of GCCS-J capabilities based on open standards that are deployable in a variety of operational environments (i.e. local, cloud, mobile, etc.). This effort includes development of GCCS-J capabilities to enhance functionality, implement new requirements, increase efficiency, and lower operating, and deployment costs through the employment of new and emerging technologies.</p>
<p><strong>3. Technical Characteristics:</strong> The GCCS-J PMO requires expertise to develop and integrate modern geospatial data processing and visualization tools, and to demonstrate innovative ways to consume, manage, and distribute command &amp; control information including multi-domain situational awareness, missile defense, force protection, logistics, readiness, and intelligence. These tools should leverage modern web standards including HTML5 and should be presented in a variety of form factors including large-screen operations center applications, desktops, and mobile devices such as tablet computers, and smartphones.</p>
<p>In addition, the GCCS-J PMO is seeking the development of enterprise services for the consumption, decoding &amp; encoding, analysis, correlation, fusion, and distribution of C2 data utilizing Big Data techniques &amp; technologies, and cloud patterns including Platform &amp; Infrastructure as a Service (PaaS / IaaS). These services should support processing of information on both classified and unclassified networks, and should address secure mobile use cases including warnings and alert notifications.</p>
<p><strong>4. Requested Information:</strong> Based on the above scope of effort and technical characteristics, the GCCS-J PMO is requesting information on the following:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Design approach or considerations for the efficient and secure development, deployment, and operations within DoD networks (NIPR and SIPR), utilizing cloud and / or big data technologies, and within the Joint Information Environment (JIE) framework.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Ideas on how C2 data can be visually presented and efficiently enacted upon given various form factors (e.g. large-screen, desktops, and mobile devices).</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Considerations that would contribute to lower costs of development, deployment, and operations.</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Please cite any existing contracts where your technical solution or service is currently being provided to the government.</p>

A.3 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2015)
  (a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services.  The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.
  (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.
  (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.
  (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
  (e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
  (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.
  (g) Invoice.
    (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include-
      (i) Name and address of the Contractor;
      (ii) Invoice date and number;
      (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number;
      (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered;
      (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading;
      (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered;
      (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent;
      (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and
      (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
      (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
        (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
        (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures.
        (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

        (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).
      (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.

  (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
    (1) The schedule of supplies/services.

    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
    (7) The Standard Form 1449.

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.
(End of Clause)
