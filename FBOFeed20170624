**DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK
1.0 BACKGROUND

Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) has a significant need for non-VA economic, credit, and housing market data that will allow LGY staff to compare VA program data to broader markets, forecast future loan and borrower performance, and provide the capacity to test and implement data-driven program policy decisions.  Having access to this robust and detailed data, and the sophisticated level of predictive analysis and forecasting will provide a needed and significant enhancement to the LGY program s capability to design and assess various policies aimed at increasing loan performance, assisting borrowers in default, and analyzing existing credit underwriting and loss mitigation standards.  This acquisition will also provide LGY with enhanced ability to meet its established strategic objective of being a data-driven organization, and with the ability to professionally calculate its Residual Income tables; a key loan underwriting metric of borrower creditworthiness.  

SCOPE

The providing of data, analysis, and on-call analytical support will be required for the duration of the contract.  As LGY does not have access to an active data source of publicly and privately held economic and census factors that would allow for the multi-leveled analysis of program data, future outlook of LGY programs, as well as external influences to LGY programs, this contract must allow for actively updated data sources, as well as a staff of analysts and economists capable of providing in-depth, robust support to LGY on the entire range of available housing, credit, and economic data.   As this data and analytic support is crucial to the success of a number of ongoing and near-term major program initiatives, the LGY program requires a product and professional on-call support that is immediately available, that can provide demonstrated success in other similar industries and programs undertaking similar initiatives, and that has been validated for professional use in a financial and Federal audit capacity.


2.1 PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  
The Contractor shall complete the work required for one year from the date of award, with four option years, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer (CO).  If the Contractor proposes an earlier completion date, and the Government accepts the Contractor s proposal, the Contractor s proposed completion date should prevail. The work shall begin within five business days of the contract being awarded, unless otherwise specified.  Work at the government site will not take place on Federal holidays or weekends unless directed by the CO.

TBD, but will most likely be a NACI

Contractor Responsibilities

1.  The Contractor shall bear the expense of obtaining background investigations or reciprocals of previous investigations held that meet or exceed the required investigation level.   The cost of background investigations is based on the current Office of Personnel Management (OPM) rate at the time the application is processed at OPM.

The Vendor Cage Code number must be provided to the VA SIC, which will verify the information and conclude whether access to the Government s site(s) and/or VA LAN systems can be granted.

         10. The investigative history for Contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either OPM or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). 

Government Responsibilities

1.  After the SIC has adjudicated the background investigation package from the Contractor, the SIC will send an e-mail notification to the Contractor and their POC identifying the e-QIP website link that includes detailed instructions regarding completion of the background clearance application process and the level of background that was requested. 

2.  Upon receipt of required investigative documents, SIC will review the investigative documents for completion and initiate the background investigation by forwarding the investigative documents to OPM to conduct the background investigation. If the investigative documents are not complete, the SIC will notify the vendor of deficiencies and include corrective instructions.

3.  VA will pay for investigations and reciprocals processed through the VA SIC and conducted by OPM in advance, however, the Contractor shall reimburse the full cost of background investigations/reciprocals to VA within 30 days of Bill of Collections from VA. VA shall send up to three plus one final delinquent notice to the Contractor. If the Contractor does not adhere to the Bill of Collections, future invoices may be subject to be offset by VA to recoup background investigation costs and may be considered grounds for default.

4.  The COR will notify and forward the Contractor a copy of the Certificate of Eligibility (Form 4236) if the investigation has been reciprocated. The COR will also notify the Contractor of an unfavorable adjudication by the Government.
Security Incident Investigation

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action the breaches VA security procedures.  The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

However, we are further restricting consideration pursuant to the following authority:<br />FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>SSA recently upgraded three of its lecture classrooms by installing new equipment with state of the art, improved functions to provide training to employees. The equipment installed consists of a programmable Crestron switcher, video teleconferencing equipment, 508 listening devices, DVD player, sound system, microphones, projectors, and televisions. Yorktel, the company that installed the new equipment, created a customized computer program for the programmable Crestron switcher, making Yorktel the proprietary owner. The switcher required a special program to recognize when the rooms where combined as one large lecture room and when they were serving as two individual lecture rooms. This allows the system to turn on and off different functions in each room depending on whether the rooms are combined or separated. Yorktel also provided individualized switcher software to route audio and video equipment in each room. Yorktel provided the installation and the programming with a one-year manufacturer warranty. This acquisition for a maintenance contract with Yorktel will provide telephone help desk support, dispatched onsite technician support to repair equipment, and repair or replacement of malfunctioning equipment.</p>
<p>The Government has determined not to compete this proposed order based upon this information. This is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/pre-solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-17-224 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to Gilson Inc located at 3000 Parmenter St. Middleton, WI 53562.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-95, dated January 19, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 811310 with size standard of $7.5 Million Dollars.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, which indicates that only Gilson Inc is capable of providing the necessary support services. Specifically, Gilson Inc `is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the instruments requiring service and the instruments are proprietary to this company. As such, only Gilson Inc is authorized to provide service and parts for this equipment. Use of any other contractor would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully operational to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of longitudinal research study data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences mission. Accordingly, only Gilson Inc is capable of providing the required maintenance support services.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The mission of the NCGC is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. In our research, we need to assess the biological utility of small molecules, prepared in our laboratory. This determination relies on the purity and correct identity of the compound of interest. Here at the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, we are engaged in various research activities, including, but not limited to, high-throughput screening, parallel synthesis, assay optimization and bioconjugate preparation. This is an integral part of our purification instrumentation as it is both an injector and a fraction collector.  When integrated into existing equipment, it draws the sample into the system.  After the sample flows through the system, this same piece of equipment collects the pure sample into individual test tubes.  We need to assess the biological utility of small molecules, prepared in our laboratory. Most every experiment done in our lab requires solvent for synthesis and purification, specifically HPLC purification where a high volume of fractions containing purified sample are produced.  This equipment requested will increase the current capacity of our lab so we can purify more samples in a shorter period of time.  The increasing number of chemists in our group synthesizing requires additional equipment to meet the demand of increasing number of target molecules being produced.  This is a unique piece of instrumentation.  This request is for a Service Agreement that covers all service repairs and one Preventative Maintenance (PM) visit for the specified equipment for one year. If warranty service becomes necessary, the instrument will be repaired or replaced at Gilson's option. Details of the work and testing to be performed during the PM Service visit are included in the quotation. Response time will be at the best efforts of the service representative.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to maintain service agreement for Gilson Systems.</p>

<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated for relevance to the current requirement.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be evaluated using a summary adjectival rating in accordance with the following scale:</p>
<p>Excellent<br />The proposal has exceptional merit and reflects an excellent approach which will clearly result in the superior attainment of all requirements and objectives. This clearly achievable approach includes several advantageous characteristics of substance, and very few disadvantages, which can be expected to result in outstanding performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very low as the proposal provides solutions which are unquestionably feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered very low risk in that they are exceptionally clear and<br />precise, fully supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Very Low</p>
<p>Good<br />The proposal demonstrates a sound approach which is expected to meet all requirements and objectives. This sound approach includes advantageous characteristics of substance, and few relatively minor disadvantages, which collectively can be expected to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low as the proposal contains solutions which are considered feasible and practical. These solutions are further considered to reflect low risk in that they are clear and precise, supported, and demonstrate an understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Low</p>
<p>Acceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which is capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach includes both advantageous and disadvantageous characteristics of substance, where the advantages are not outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are likely to result in acceptable performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate, as the proposal solutions are generally feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect moderate risk in that they may be somewhat clear and precise, partially supported, and/or demonstrate a general understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: Neutral</p>
<p>Marginal<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which may not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. The approach has disadvantages of substance and advantages, which if they exist, are outweighed by the disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages present a low or questionable likelihood of resulting in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high as the proposal contains solutions which may not be feasible and practical. These solutions may also be considered to reflect high risk in that they lack clarity and precision, are generally unsupported, and/or do not demonstrate a complete understanding of the requirements. Risk Level: High</p>
<p>Unacceptable<br />The proposal demonstrates an approach which, based on a very high risk, will very likely not be capable of meeting all requirements and objectives. This approach has several disadvantages of substance, and advantages which, if they exist, are outweighed by disadvantages. Collectively, the advantages and disadvantages are unlikely to result in satisfactory performance. The risk of unsuccessful performance is very high as the proposal contains solutions which are not feasible and practical. The solutions may also be considered to reflect very high risk in that they lack any clarity or precision. Risk Level: Very High</p>
