Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center located in Natick, MA is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), or near NDI Body Ventilation Systems.  The United States Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to evaluate candidate systems.  AFSOC is interested in contracting with vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design, efficiency, effectiveness and fabrication of items which, when used in conjunction with protective garments, can provide a sufficient body ventilation capability for Warfighters working in high temperature and humidity environmental conditions.  Of key interest are technologies and methodologies that maximize the coupling efficiency between the personal ventilation system and the human body. The Government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria.  Further, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field a limited number of systems to meet military operational needs.  Vendors must have adequate fabrication and test facilities to warrant pre-production testing and limited procurement of Body Ventilation Systems.  Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide a working hardware system ready for test and demonstration purposes on or about 1 June 2012 and capable of offering a product that provides a minimum of 8 cubic feet per minute of air flow at a back pressure of 3 inches of water column.  In addition the system must be capable of meeting the following criteria:<br> 	Allow user to comfortably and safely accomplish demanding physical tasks for at least 120 minutes in extremely high temperature and humidity environmental conditions without recharging or refueling.<br> 	Power consumption not to exceed 12 watts at the design flow rate of 8 cfm.<br> 	Maximum weight of 2 pounds, including the power source.<br> 	Maximum system size (i.e. volume) should not exceed 45 in3 (~0.75 liter), including power source.<br> 	Distribution vest capable of being directly integrated into Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR), Interceptor and/or Eagle Vest body armor. <br><br>Responses to this market survey are due on or before 1 June 2012, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  Please provide name of firm, address, POC, phone/fax number, and email address.  Submit data of the item to U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, ATTN:  RDNS-TSE (Brad Laprise), 15 Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.<br>

You may fax or mail your request ATTN: CCAM-ALM, Jody Byrd, Contract Specialist, or Jeanie Clark, Contracting Officer, FAX number 256-955-9237.  No telephone requests or emails will be accepted.  The contractor shall furnish all depot level labor, facilities, tools, testing equipment and materials to overhaul the T-55 Engine, Input/Output NSN: 2840-01-458-5361 Input/Output PN: 2-001-020-39, in support of the CH-47 aircraft.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price, 5 year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for a minimum quantity of 50 each, maximum quantity of 870 each, including 100 each for FMS. The T-55 Engine is a Critical Safety Item (CSI).   The DMWR is considered technically complete but not sufficiently appropriate for a full and open competition due to some of the processes containing limited repair criteria due to intellectual data rights owned by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  Any competing contractor would not be familiar with the total design parameters, specific repair parts requirements, and test processes for the T-55-GA-714A engine.  As determined by the Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED), the only approved source for this item is the OEM, Honeywell International, Cage Code 02LU7, 1300 West Warner Road, Tempe, AZ 85284-2896.  It has been determined that this requirement can be met by commercial items.  Therefore, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 will be used.  This requirement is currently unfunded.  Award will be withheld pending receipt of sufficient funds.  The closing date annotated is an estimated date and may be adjusted dependent upon the date of release for solicitation; however, the solicitation will not close prior to the date stated above.

The contractor monitors the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) and collects samples in accordance with current Monitoring and Reporting Programs (MRPs), submits data to Resource Ranger, assists Resource Ranger, Natural Resource Specialist, and management on technical and operational elements of reporting.  
The duties of the contractor include activities required to bring and keep the waste water facilities at New Melones Reservoir in compliance with Waste Discharge Requirement (WDR) permits. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Central Valley Region, issued WDRs for the WWTF at Tuttletown (Order Number 87-084) and Glory Hole (Order Number R5-2002-0125).  Reclamation is the named discharger in these WDR permits, and is responsible for the operation of these WWTFs.  Per the requirements of the State of California and the RWQCB, the contractor (Operator) must possess a current Wastewater Operator certification at Grade 1 (minimum) from the California Office of Operator Certification and be registered by the State Water Resources Control Board as a contract operator and be able to serve in the capacity of Chief Operator.  The Operator must also possess a current Laboratory Analyst/Water Quality Analyst Certificate from the California Water Pollution Control Association (CWPCA) or the California-Nevada Section of the American Water Works Association (CA-NV/AWWA) Grade 1 (minimum). All wastewater facilities will be operated under the certificate of the contractor.  Contractor will have necessary qualifications to provide oversight of Reclamation's Operator-in-Training (OIT) and will assist the OIT in receiving certification.
The WDR for Glory Hole WWTF requires ongoing monitoring and monthly, quarterly and annual reporting.  The WDR for Tuttletown WWTF requires ongoing monitoring and annual reporting if requested by the RWQCB.  The current MRP at Tuttletown does not require any sampling of groundwater monitoring wells at that location, however continuing with quarterly sampling is beneficial to Reclamation.  Voluntary groundwater monitoring at Tuttletown will be continued until there is a revised MRP requiring groundwater monitoring at this location.  Reporting on the required monitoring shall be submitted in accordance with the due dates specified in each WDR.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a requirement to a firm that is capable of providing an economic analysis software that is a commercial, readily available, off-the-shelf software package.  Contractors that need to actually develop an economic software package as opposed to off- the-shelf, will not be considered by the Government.  A second requirement is that the Government requires the ability to unilaterally run or use the software as opposed to having a contractor execute any required economic analysis as some Government data may be classified as sensitive.  The Government only requires a license or purchase for a six month period of performance. Reclamation needs a CGE model that incorporates I-O, econometrics, and new economic geography.  The required CGE/conjoined input-output model should allow for price effect and potential changes in price elasticities (econometrics) which is not possible using the standard input-output analysis. Reclamation needs to be able to aggregate and analyze per each region according to selected economic indicators.   Reclamation needs to able to specify the rest of the US as a region. The contractor's database has to consist of 2012 economic data.  Reclamation needs to be able to produce output as changes in employment (jobs per years), income (annual real disposable income in dollars), and value of production output (annual dollars).  Other product and service features may be required upon release of the request for quote/proposal.
 This is a small business set-aside.  Any small business firm that believes it can execute the pending requirement is encouraged to obtain a copy of the Request for Proposal from the Contracting Officer.  All contractors requesting a copy of the Request for Proposal within the synopsis posting period will be forwarded a copy of the Request for Quote/Proposal upon its release.  Please note that based on how Fed-Biz Ops posts a synopsis, the "Post Date" is the first day of the synopsis publication, and the "Original Response Date/Current Response Date" equates to the expiration date of the synopsis, not the due date of any proposal.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning.  Responses should include the firm's business size in accordance with the size standard:  $25 Million for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 511210.

Tasks performed under thiscontract include technology development, systems acquisition, mission planning,operations, and product support for sensors, systems, and platforms. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from Southern Research Institute (SRI) on asole-source basis by increasing the maximum not-to-exceed value of the current contractby $9,000,000.00. The AIRS hardware and software used in support of these sensors,systems, and platforms was developed by Southern Research Institute. This hardware andsoftware requires system engineering in relation to mission planning of which SRI hasbeen the sole provider. In addition, the hardware associated with these sensors andsystems contains software and algorithms that were developed solely by SRI and areproprietary to SRI. Because the software is constantly changing due to operationalrequirements, SRI has developed procedures and tools used to operate the software. Thisunique expertise is critical to the integrity of the software. For this reason, SRI isconsidered the only source with the specialized knowledge and data rights necessary tofulfill the Governments requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 28, 2012. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

The VA is soliciting for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses with cascading procedures for award as described below. All documents will be available on or about March 16, 2012. Inquiries may be sent via e-mail to Crystal.Showell@va.gov. 

The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 562112.  Responders should identify if they are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, a small business or small disadvantaged business concern, based on this NAICS code.

METHOD OF AWARD - CASCADE PROCEDURE: Any award(s) resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence:

1. In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern (see Section K, FAR 52.219-1, "Small Business Program Representations" for small business size definition) who submits a responsive offer, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.

2. If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award will be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.

3. If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award will be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5.

4. If there is inadequate competition for award to a small business concern, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all responsive offers submitted by responsible business concerns. 

Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if-

At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and

Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-

6. When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive offer is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the offer(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the offer from the SDVOSB business will then be included with SB offer(s) received; finally, if there is inadequate competition at the SB tier, the SDVOSB offer will be included with all responsive offers.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Perkin Elmer Health Sciences Inc., 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT, 06484-4794 for the purchase of one (1), Alpha Screen Nickel Chelate Acceptor Beads, 250mg, and two hundred and fifty (250), Alpha Screen GSH Donor Beads.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The mission of NCATS is to apply the tools of small molecule screening and discovery to the development of chemical probe research tools, for use in the study of protein and cell functions, and biological processes relevant to physiology and disease. NCATS will optimize biochemical, cellular and model organism-based assays submitted by the biomedical research community; perform automated high-throughput screening (HTS); and perform chemistry optimization on confirmed hits to produce chemical probes for dissemination to the research community.</p>
<p>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION<br />1.Quanity:one (1), Alpha Screen Nickel Chelate Acceptor Beads,250 mg.<br />2.Quanity: Two hundred and fifty (250), Alpha Screen GSH Donor Beads.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION<br />The sole source determination is based upon the fact that Perkin Elmer does not distribute this item to any other resellers so they are the sole providers. Additionally, assays were developed by the Zhao lab that measures the physical interaction between the proteins Six1 and Eya2, and CtBP and E1A. Extensive assay development concluded that the Alphascreen&reg; reagent from Perkin Elmer provided that highest quality assay for HTS in 1536-well format used at NCGC. Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (ALPHA) is a very sensitive non-radioactive homogeneous assay technology that allows the screening of a large range of biological interactions and activities. In this assay system, each protein partner is tagged either with GST or polyHis. Alphascreen beads labeled with anti-GST or Ni metal are used to detect the physical proximity between the partners. Binding of molecules captured on the beads leads to an energy transfer from one bead to the other, ultimately producing a luminescent/fluorescent signal. AlphaScreen assays require two bead types: Donor beads and Acceptor beads. Each bead type contains a different proprietary mixture of chemicals, which are key elements of the AlphaScreen technology. Donor beads contain a photosensitizer, phthalocyanine, which converts ambient oxygen to an excited and reactive form of O 2, singlet oxygen, upon illumination at 680 nm. Like other excited molecules, singlet oxygen has a limited lifetime prior to falling back to ground state. Within its 4 &micro;sec half-life, singlet oxygen can diffuse approximately 200 nm in solution. If an Acceptor bead is within that proximity, energy is transferred from the singlet oxygen to thioxene derivatives within the Acceptor bead, subsequently culminating in light production at 520--620 nm. In the absence of an Acceptor bead, singlet oxygen falls to ground state and no signal is produced. This proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer is the basis for AlphaScreen's homogeneous nature. NCGC has done extensive work (described in RO3 applications submitted) to miniaturize the assay to 1536-well format and demonstrated that it produces robust data using the HTS capabilities at NCGC by doing pilot screens with small compound collections. We must use the same variables in our assays to maintain integrity from the data and to achieve the desired outcomes. This item has been purchased in the past from this vendor only, as no one else can provide these specific reagents. All the assay optimization was performed with these Donor beads. Going forward, the screening needs to be done with the same reagents in order to yield comparable and readily interpretable results. A switch to a different detection reagent would necessitate re-optimizing the assay with no guarantees that the results would be similar. This would entail unacceptable substantial time delays and enormous additional costs.<br />The current Alphascreen PE assay is ready for HTS at NCGC. The Six1/Eya2 and CtBP/E1A Alphascreen binding assays consists of reagents labeled proprietary fluorophores. <br /><br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, with business size standard of 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011). This acquisition is set-aside for small business.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by March 21, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.<br /><br />Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-097-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6145, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee. Response may be submitted electronically to Rashida.ferebee@nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

The National Park Service operates a visitor shuttle bus system in Yosemite National Park. This system consists of twenty-two hybrid electric diesel 39 passenger buses manufactured by Gillig Corporation, Hayward, California.  Eighteen buses were purchased by NPS for Yosemite in 2005; four additional hybrid electric diesel buses were acquired in 2011.
The power system of these buses consists of an electric battery pack and diesel engine.  The battery pack has a useful life of approximately six years, at which time electric storage system (ESS) refresh battery kits/conversion kits are needed to keep the buses operating.  The eighteen buses acquired in 2005 are in need of refresh/conversion kits.   
Electric storage system (ESS) Refresh Kit and ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion Kit are an assimilation of electric propulsion components and parts provided by Allison Electric Drive, the original engine manufacturer (OEM) of the Gillig hybrid electric diesel 39 passenger buses which comprise the park's visitor transportation (shuttle bus) system.
The ESS Refresh Kit/ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion Kit is a package of engine parts and components specified by the OEM for the Gillig hybrid electric diesel buses. The Electric storage system (ESS) Refresh Kit and ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion are the only package of components and parts specified by the OEM. The refresher kit package provided by Allison Electric Drive meets all the specifications of the Gillig power system. No other refresher kit/conversion kit package is provided or specified for the Gillig power system.
The ESS Refresh Kit is essential to the continued operation of the electric propulsion system of the Gillig hybrid electric diesel buses.  Each refresher kit lasts approximately six years.  The original fleet of 18 Gillig hybrid diesel buses was delivered in May 2005.

<DESC>1. Contract Information:  Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award one contract to be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  A-E services are required construction phase support services.  Additionally, as an option, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications for projects in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED NC rating tool v2.2 and 2009/v3, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Construction Bulletin No 2014 issued 28 June 2010 and LEED requirements provided by TAM customers.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  One indefinite delivery contract will be negotiated and awarded, each with one base year and four, 1-year option periods.  The amount of this contract will not exceed $90 million over the five year period (presuming the Government elects to exercise all option periods).  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price, labor hour or cost reimbursable task orders.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Services Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work).  Task orders awarded under the contract may occur throughout the US Central Command AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf States, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa.  Selected firms will be required to work in these areas, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and travel to these regions may be required.  FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, is applicable to this contract, as funds are presently not available for this contract.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work that it intends to subcontract.  TAM Subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 5% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Yemen. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The firm will provide local national (LN), third country national (TCN), and/or US citizen subject matter experts to perform on-site construction phase support services for assigned projects in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).The positions for LN and TCN shall replicate typical foreign national service (FNS) employee positions obtained by U.S. Government Agencies to support overseas projects and locations.  TAM requires Construction Managers, Construction Schedulers, Data Managers, Office Managers, Project Engineers and Quality Assurance Representatives. These employees will gather information on contractor performance and report this information back to Government personnel. Government personnel will retain final decision-making authority on contractor performance. All work will be submitted in hardcopy format and/or through an automated system to Government personnel designed in each task order. As an option in this contract, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications.  3.

<DESC>The Coast Guard is continuing to conduct market research for the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) acquisition.
<p>The Coast Guard intends to release the red-lined draft OPC System Specification, the draft Statements of Work, draft Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), draft Schedule A, Draft Schedule C and draft DD-254 for Industry review and comment on or about March 14, 2012.  <br />The red-lined draft System Specification contains all of the changes that the Coast Guard incorporated as a result of industry comment. This document will be automatically distributed to those companies and individuals that received the draft OPC specification released in May 2011.  The other draft documents will be available on the USCG OPC website at:  http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/OPC/default.asp</p>
<p>The draft specification requires the OPC to be classed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) to the ABS Rules for Building and Classing Naval Vessels, January 2010 (a.k.a. the Naval Vessel Rules or NVR).  The draft specification invokes NVR as a first tier reference and tailors it through an Addendum.  This NVR Tailoring Addendum contains OPC specific tailoring to the Naval Vessel Rules 2010.  As such, it is impossible to understand the OPC specification, and complete cutter requirements, without access to NVR.  Instructions for requesting access to NVR are available on the OPC website.<br />Your attention is directed to the fact that the NVR contains sensitive information relating to critical technology which must be protected from release to unauthorized non US entities and parties not having a valid need to know.  NVR is marked as "Distribution Statement D" and must be maintained in accordance with SECNAVINST 5510.36, DOD Directive 5230.25, OPNAVINST 5510.101 and Title 22 USC Section 2751. Violators of these laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.<br />In addition, NVR is governed by the International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which means it contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, USC Sect 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1970, as amended (Title 50 USC App 2401, et seq.). Violators of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  It must be disseminated per the provisions of OPNAVINST 5510.161.<br />The OPC draft specification and NVR Tailoring Addendum must also be treated with these same sensitivities.  Secondary distribution of these documents is limited in accordance with their "Distribution Statement C" markings to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors.  <br />Companies or individuals who have not previously registered with the U. S. Coast Guard and are interested in reviewing the draft documentation should send an email to:</p>
<p>offshore.patrol@uscg.mil</p>
<p>requesting your company's draft documentation.  Include in your email which specification sections or draft documents you wish to review and the email address you desire the documents delivered.  Provide acknowledgement that you are a U. S. citizen representing a U. S. company and provide your DUNS number for validation.  Also indicate if your company currently has access to NVR.<br />The draft specification is available in the following sections:<br />&bull;	000 - General Guidance and Administration<br />&bull;	100 - Hull Structure<br />&bull;	200 - Propulsion Plant<br />&bull;	300 - Electrical Plant<br />&bull;	400 - Command and Surveillance<br />&bull;	500 - Auxiliary Systems<br />&bull;	600 - Outfit and Furnishings<br />&bull;	700 - Armament<br />&bull;	Addendum I:  OPC tailoring of NVR<br />In order for the Coast Guard to consider responses and comments on the draft documentation, they must be submitted on the form provided and emailed to:</p>
<p>offshore.patrol@uscg.mil<br />In order for your comments to be reviewed and considered for incorporation into the draft Request for Proposals, responses must be received by April 30th, 2012.  Comments received after that date may be considered for incorporation in the final RFP.  Incremental submission of comments is strongly encouraged.  Please make your comments and justification for your comments as comprehensive and complete as possible.    <br />The Coast Guard intends to share feedback received with ABS and Coast Guard support contractors.  Proprietary or business confidential markings that prohibit distribution to either ABS or Coast Guard support contractors should be included only where warranted.  <br />Updates on the OPC acquisition, including future planned market research/industry engagement, will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunity website.<br />Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.   Responses received after the established deadline may not be considered.</p>

METHOD OF AWARD  CASCADE PROCEDURE

a. Any award(s) resulting from this solicitation will be made using the following cascade order of precedence:

	(1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.14 and PL 109-461, award under this solicitation will be made on a competitive basis first to an eligible Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business (SDVOSB) concern ( FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations for small business size definition) who submits a responsive offer, provided that there is adequate competition among such firms.

	(2) If there is inadequate competition for award to a SDVOSB concern, award may be made competitively to an eligible Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) concern.

	(3) If there is inadequate competition for award to a VOSB concern, award may be made competitively to an 8a or HubZone small business concern.

	(4) If there is inadequate competition for award to an 8a or HubZone small business concern, award may be made competitively to a small business concern IAW FAR 19.5.

b. Adequate competition shall be deemed to exist if

	(1) At least two competitive offers are received from qualified, technically acceptable and responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration; and

	(2) Award will be made at fair market prices as determined in accordance with FAR 19.202-6.

c.   When there is inadequate competition at any tier, an otherwise competitive offer from a responsible business concern at that tier will be considered with the eligible offers for the next lower tier. For example, only one competitive offer is received from a SDVOSB business. That offer will be included with the offer(s) received from all VOSB businesses. If there is still inadequate competition, the offer from the SDVOSB business will then be included with 8(a) or

Summary

This 100% SDVOSB set-aside acquisition under NAICS 541330 is for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with task orders to be issued on an indefinite quantity, indefinite delivery basis for Engineering Services at various stations within the VISN 19 Healthcare System. The Government intends to award a minimum of three and a maximum of eight IDIQ contracts under this solicitation. After selection of qualified contractors under this planned acquisition, task orders will be issued on an as-needed and as-funded basis for projects at all stations within the VISN19 Rocky Mountain Region. These task orders will be for Engineering Services not to exceed $9,999,999.00 per task order. The total amount of individual task orders which may be placed against each IDIQ contract will not exceed $33,500,000.00 beginning with the base year of 2012 and running through the four option years beginning with FY 2013 and ending in 2016.  The solicitation is estimated to be issued in mid-October, 2011 with contract awards estimated to be made at the end of Calendar Year 2011.
 
Background
The VHA VISN19 Healthcare Network is currently experiencing a lack of quick response capability to execute acquisitions for Medical Facility (MF) infrastructure funding. Executing these IDIQs should result in significantly reduced lead times for acquiring capable contractors to execute these MF projects at competitive pricing.

Required Engineering Services and geographical region to be served
The Contractor shall provide Engineering Services as listed under NAICS code 541330 Engineering Services - This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in applying physical laws and principles of engineering in the design, development, and utilization of machines, materials, instruments, structures, processes, and systems. The assignments undertaken by these establishments may involve any of the following activities: provision of advice, preparation of feasibility studies, preparation of preliminary and final plans and designs, provision of technical services during the construction or installation phase, inspection and evaluation of engineering projects, and related services. 

The task order projects will be performed at the VAMCs located in Denver, CO, Grand Junction, CO, Salt Lake City, UT, Fort Harrison, MT, Sheridan, WY and Cheyenne, WY. Contractors may perform services at any of these locations. Contractors will be provided a fair opportunity to compete for task orders at those locations checked within the dollar range indicated below, if they are awarded a contract. Offerors must state in their offers that they are willing to bid on and complete work for task orders for any of the VAMC locations list below if awarded an IDIQ contract. 
 
Cost

The IDIQ contract will not be priced other than including a minimum task order amount to be determined.  The total of this IDIQ will have a ceiling amount of $33,500,000 over the five year life (including four one-year options) of the contracts.

Delivery or performance-period requirements

The performance period for this contract is expected to begin upon award and continue for one calendar year thereafter.  Four option years will also be included to be exercised as the VA deems necessary. 

Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, prior to receiving an award of a contract under this SDVOSB set- aside. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

<p>TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY (TACP) CLOSE AIR SUPPORT SYSTEM (CASS) SOFTWARE VERSION 1.4.5 DEVELOPMENT AND INTERIM CONTRACTOR SUPPORT<br />1. Introduction<br />The U.S. Air Force's Electronics Systems Center (ESC) is requesting information from responsible sources with experience in complex software engineering and tactical battlefield communications to develop and support TACP CASS Software Version 1.4.5. The development effort will include all system and software engineering and testing to field this next generation of CASS software on multiple platforms (e.g., mounted, dismounted) within the TACP environment. Interim Contractor Support (ICS) will be required once the new software version (Version 1.4.5) is fielded.<br />The current fielded CASS Software is Version 1.4.2. CASS Software Version 1.4.4 is under development by Rockwell Collins, Poway, CA, and will be fielded starting in October 2012, with ICS for Version 1.4.4 expected to be provided by Rockwell Collins through September 2015. <br />NOTE: This RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Its issuance does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information properly marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any information.<br />2. Objectives<br />The Government is seeking new software capability with or without incorporation of the existing source code to fulfill the following objectives related to the next generation of CASS software (Version 1.4.5): <br />a.

<DESC>The United States (US) Army has an increasing requirement to provide Force Protection (FP) services at temporary and permanent Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) installations.   Additionally, as the Department of Defense (DOD) draws down forces in support of Operations New Dawn and Enduring Freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, services will be required for fielded FP systems including associated Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  <br>The Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PdM-FPS) mission includes providing timely, affordable, modular, scalable, supportable and integratable physical security and FP capabilities to tactical forces, military installations and Other Governmental Agencies (OGA).  The PdM-FPS mission includes the requirement to install, operate, de-install/re-install, reconfigure refurbish, retrofit, retrograde, integrate and modify FP systems, equipment and components when and where needed.  Integral to the success of this mission is the ability to compete requirements among qualified contractors in an efficient and timely manner.  PdM-FPS will support the growing demand and complexity of the FP/Physical Security Equipment (PSE) requirements by awarding multiple contracts under this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The objective is to establish long-term, competitively awarded, contracts with continued competition at the Task Order (TO) level.  Each contractor will have a fair opportunity to be considered for all subsequent TO level requirements within the scope of this contract, supporting the range and depth of the required capabilities.  This contract will provide affordable access to FP/PSE services over the Period of Performance (POP).<br>

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is committed to reducing the ever-increasing cost that disasters inflict on our country. Preventing losses before they happen by building to withstand anticipated forces, is one of the key components of mitigation. Mitigation is the only truly effective way of reducing the cost of these disasters. One of the more promising methodologies that can be used to reduce damages from an earthquake or other similar hazard over and above the current life safety target of the nation's current building codes is performance-based design.<br /><br />Current building codes for the design of new buildings are prescriptive in nature and are intended principally to provide for a life-safety level of protection when the design-level event such as an earthquake occurs. While these codes are intended to produce buildings that meet a life-safety performance level for a specified level of ground shaking, they do not provide a procedure that enables the designer to determine if other performance levels will be achieved or exceeded. During a design level earthquake, a code-designed building could achieve the goal of preventing the loss of life or life-threatening injury to the occupants, but could still sustain extensive structural and nonstructural damage and be out of service for an extended period of time. In some cases, the damage may be too costly to repair, with demolition being the only option. While some current design guidance and building codes for existing buildings do incorporate some performance based design elements, these are older criteria that do not address issues explained below.

<DESC>PROFILE OF AMERICAN CONSUMPTION AND DIET QUALITY
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.<br />A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a procurement for a research study in Fiscal Year 2012 and is seeking statements of capability from potential offerors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in the capability statement.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study is to provide a comprehensive picture of the nutrient intakes, diet quality, and food choices of nutrition assistance program participants, eligible nonparticipants, and higher income nonparticipants. The nutrition assistance programs of interest include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). This study will use the latest data available from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The proposed study will update previous work, which used data collected from 1999 through 2004.</p>
<p>The study objectives are as follows:<br />1. Analyze the nutrient intakes and food choices of participants of the SNAP, NSLP, and WIC programs compare to low-income and higher-income nonparticipants. <br />&bull; How do the food choices of all three groups compare? <br />&bull; Are there differences in the comparisons among major populations such as children, working-aged adults, and elderly, or between the genders?<br />2. Analyze the relationship between food choices of low-income individuals, participation in one or more nutrition assistance programs, and obesity.<br />3. Assess the impact of program participation on nutrient intake and diet quality, if feasible.<br />4. Analyze and compare food choice and nutrient intake of participants of multiple nutrition assistance programs with nonparticipants or participants of only one program, if feasible. <br />&bull; Is there an additional effect associated with participating in more than one nutrition assistance program versus participating in only one program?</p>
<p>NHANES is a population-based survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics that is designed to collect information on the health and nutrition of the U.S. population. About 5,000 persons participate in this survey each year. There are two parts to this survey: <br />1) The home interview, and <br />2) The health examination.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />The home interview collects data on food security, demographics, income, housing characteristics, and program participation. The health examination is performed in a mobile examination center. A number of tests are performed, depending on the respondents' age and gender. The examination includes information on blood pressure, body fat, height and weight, physical activity, health status, diabetes, and a dietary recall interview. The dietary recall interview collects data on foods and beverages consumed during the preceding 24 hours. Data are released in two-year survey intervals. The most current data available are from 2009-2010. Data from 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 are also available.</p>
<p>FNS anticipates that the study will largely rely on data from the dietary recall interview, supplemented with data collected through the household interview, examination survey, and physical examination. This will include data on household income, individual age and sex, program participation, and height and weight.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT INFORMATION<br />Please address your knowledge and experience within the last three (3) years and how you will provide each of the following points (A) through (G). Reference specific examples of how your firm has addressed the points listed below. Demonstrate your ability and experience with:<br />(A) Conducting descriptive and multivariate analyses on the NHANES data, or similar nutritional datasets.<br />(B) Assessing nutrient intake and dietary quality. <br />(C) Writing technical reports.<br />(D) Writing reports of technical information put into language appropriate to non-technical audiences.<br />(E) Providing briefings of technical data appropriate for non-technical audiences.<br />(F) Writing policy briefs appropriate for the USDA website and public communication.<br />(G) Managing projects of a similar size and scope, including meeting government objectives, ensuring the quality and timeliness of deliverables, and coordinating with the government funding agency.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!</strong> The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for Acquisition and installation of GPS Metric Tracking upgrade module ASE-FOR STARS-10.00-GPS2 compatible with ENCO STARS range data simulator and command system emulator (currently in use). This upgrade is a required addition for the range data simulator (ENSCO STARS) due to mandated transition to GPS as the prime range tracking source. Additionally the simulated GPS MT tracking data must be based on vehicle trajectory data created by an included launch vehicle flight simulator having the capability to create, ingest and modify flight vehicle trajectory data in the form of time, position (3axis), velocity (3 axis) and, as an objective, attitude (pitch, yaw and roll). Lastly, the Simulated GPS MT tracking data must be based on the same training scenarios that the STARS (ENSCO) Rader, telemetry and optics data formats are, and must be able to be created an injected into the MRVS (ENSCO) simultaneously.
<p><br />Delivery Schedule: <strong>03 SEP 2012</strong> for development lead time This is a Sole Source with ENSCO Cage Code: 06359 or 1B4E9 IAW FAR 6.302-1. ENSCO is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement Due to the unique nature of the GPS MT data and the existing STARS interface to MRVS (ENSCO) the only compatible part number that fulfill our requirement is the ASE-FOR-STARS-10.00-GPS2 that is manufactured by ENSCO. No solicitation documents exists at this time. This item/service utilizes North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541511. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within<strong> 5 days</strong> after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCB has determined that ENSCO is the only source capable of providing this requirement. Phone calls will not be accepted.</p>

Often called as fluidicoscillators, sweeping jet actuators or flip flop oscillators, these flow control deviceswork based on the Coanda effect. They can be embedded directly into a control surface(such as a wing or a turbine blade) and generate spatially oscillating bursts (or jets)of fluid to improve flow characteristics by enhancing lift, reducing drag, or enhancingheat transfer. Recent studies show upto a 60% performance enhancement with oscillators.NASA offers two new fluidic oscillator designs that address two key limitations of theseoscillators: coupled frequency-amplitude and random oscillations. One oscillatoreffectively decouples the oscillation frequency from the amplitude. The other designenables synchronization of an entire array. The new oscillators have no moving partsoscillation, decoupling, and synchronization are achieved entirely via internal flowdynamics.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: As more countries commit to wind power, development of wind turbines is increasing. Afixture that NASA has used to produce large structural parts for unmanned aerial vehiclescan also benefit wind turbine blade manufacturing. NASAs new technology addresses somecost and manufacturability barriers with current composite wind turbine blade processing.The fixture includes flexible vacuum bagging to contain the raw material lay-up as it isroll-pressed into a gently contoured blade. The process is an alternative to hand toolingand autoclaving, and produces parts with quality close to those processed underhigh-temperature and high-pressure environments. It can use a variety of reinforcementfibers and is not dependent on matrix viscosity to achieve part wet-out, even on thicklaminations. The fixture and process are applicable to low-volume production but havepotential for adaptation to automated high rate production. NASA has obtained a patent onthe assembly, and it seeks an industry partner to commercialize the technology for windturbines.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<SUBJECT>66--Non-Competitve Justification for Tisch Environmental Air Samplers
<SOLNBR>G12PS00263
<CONTACT>Bill Claybrook

<a href="mailto:douellette@usgs.gov">bclaybrook@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for High Volume Air Sampling equipment that is compatible with equipment currently owned by USGS.  Only Tisch Environmental, Inc. fills this requirement.  This award is based on FAR Authority 13.106-1(b)(1).  The estimated value of this award is $77,150.77.
Basis of award:Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Tisch Environmental Inc. is the proprietary manufacturer of the equipment.  We request to sole source this requisition to Tisch Environmental, Inc. as it is the only known source for this equipment that can meet the requirements in the area of air sampling to the USGS Environmental Compliance, Inc. (ECI) standards and also allow new data collected to fit seamlessly into existing records and continue the ECI Air monitoring project work began years ago without interruption.  
Tisch Environmental has custom-modified their No. 303 timers to accommodate activation every 12 days for this projects specific scheduled sampling needs.
The items requested are as follows:(1)	 TSP (Total Suspended Particulate) MFC High-volume air sampler Tisch TE-5170-D with custom-modified 12-day event clock/timer(2)	 PUF (Polyurethane Foam) sampler  Tisch TE1000-D with 12-day No. 303 timer(3)	 Ambient VOC(Volatile Organic Compounds) sampler Tisch TE- 123 single-channel canister sampler 
Tisch Envitonmental, Inc. is the propietary manufacturer of the equipment and they possess the technical knowledge and patents covering the intricate designs of the instruments and any accessory items associated with that instrument.  The Governments request is to sole source this requirement to Tisch Envitonmental, Inc., as it will provide standardization of repair parts to an existing infrastructure as well as seamless continuity of data collection for this project. The  requested system runs on existing programs and will require no modification to these programs in order to function seamlessly, saving the government time and money that would be required to integrate a similar product from another vendor.  
It is estimated that the cost for retraining employees on the new system and replacing/modifying existing equipment would be tens of thousands of dollars and would delay the project for several months.

C.	BACKGROUND

Through the Contract Nursing Home Program, the VA provides nursing home placement to eligible Veterans to meets the health needs to include: total medical, nursing, and psychosocial service and promoted the maximum well-being of the VA beneficiaries in areas of the state where the veteran may be close to home or relatives.
Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self care.  
VHA continues to be committed to building capacity to serve the long-term care needs of veterans through home and community-based care (H&CBC), State Veterans Homes, and the CNH Program. VHA also recognizes the rising concerns over quality of care in the nation's nursing homes and the need to fully implement a plan for quality monitoring.
 
D.	SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

The Contractor shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well being of VA patients.  The Contractor shall furnish care to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  Physician visits, laboratory, x ray, and other special services for VA patients shall be at the same frequency as that provided to other patients at the Contractor's facility receiving the same or comparable level of care.  In addition, the care provided shall include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA authorized level of care, without extra charge.  The per diem rate(s) established in this contract will include the cost of medical care, emergency dental care, laboratory, x ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically accepted.  The Contractor must have and maintain a Louisiana Department of Health Nursing Facility License.  

Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self care.

Absences of the patient from the Contractor's facility in excess of 48 hours shall not be reimbursable except with prior approval of the placing VA facility.

Patients receiving care under this contract, who begin to require more than the level of care authorized by VA, shall be readmitted to an appropriate VA facility, as determined and authorized by VA.   When such admission is not feasible because of the nature of the emergency, it is agreed that hospitalization in a non-federal facility shall be accomplished provided VA authorization is obtained.  VA authorization shall be obtained within 72 hours of admission of the patient to a non Federal facility.  If hospitalization of a non emergency nature is required, it is agreed that readmission to a VA Medical Center shall be accomplished as soon as the patient's condition is sufficiently stabilized to permit admission to VA.



In the event a VA beneficiary receiving Contractor care under this contract dies, the Contractor shall promptly notify the VA office authorizing admission and immediately assemble, inventory, and safeguard the patient's personal effects.  The funds, deposits, and effects left by VA patients upon the premises of the Contractor shall be delivered by the nursing to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws currently governing the Contractor for making disposition of funds and effects left by patients, unless the beneficiary died without leaving a will, heirs or next of kin capable of inheriting.

It is agreed that duly authorized representatives of VA will provide follow up supervision visits to veterans placed to assure the continuity of care and to assist in the veteran's transition back to the community.  It is understood that these visits do not substitute for nor relieve the Contractor in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.

All medical records concerning the veteran's care in the Contractor's facility will be readily accessible to VA.  Upon discharge or death of the patient, medical records will be retained by the Contractor for a period of at least three years following termination of care.

2)	The Contractor submits an assessment requesting a change in the level of care classification and VA approves it. Classification changes may also occur based on a determination by VA.  VA will make the determination whether classification changes require readmission to VA.

The VA, at its sole option, will monitor the professional care and administrative management of services provided to VA beneficiaries under this agreement, through one or any combination of the following methods; reviews of state agencies reports, on-site inspection of the Contractor's facility by VA staff, and/or on-site monitoring of VA patients.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The solicitation number is W911W6-12-T-0006 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). Under this number, the Army Contracting Command (ACC) / Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award only one firm-fixed-price contract. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-57. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 333515. The small business size standard is 500. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate intends to purchase work holding devises needed to operate recently purchased 5-axis computer numerically controlled (CNC) milling machines. This procurement shall be sourced as a single procurement from one vendor that can meet all requirements. The work holding devises shall meet or exceed the following minimum requirements. Vises: (Qty 29) vises shall be supplied measuring a minimum of 125mm wide x 12 inches long. All vises shall have a 12-inch clamping capacity, shall be self-centering with a positional repeatability of +- .0002 and shall be constructed of hardened and ground steel with a clamping force capability of up to 20000 Newton meters. All vise jaws shall contain a maximum 1/8"deep step at the top of the vise jaw and be equipped with serrations along the top of the vise jaw to allow secure clamping on 1/8" of raw stock material. The remaining surface of the same set of vise jaws must also have a flat smooth ground face to allow clamping on finished surfaces of stock. The flat ground face of vise jaws must have a minimum smooth ground clamping depth of 1 inch. All vise jaws shall be reversible to allow 12.00 inches of clamping along the length of vise. All vises shall be able to be configured with an interchangeable lead screw to allow a single self-centering vise to be converted to a double self-centering vise with a fixed center jaw that will maintain +- .0002 positional repeatability. All vises shall be supplied with a handle to enable manual actuation of vise. Mounting plates: Mounting plates will be attached to 2 different sizes of existing machine tables to enable a vise to be attached to the mounting plate using round clamping studs mounted to the bottom of each vise. Clamping of the vise to the mounting plate shall be by manual actuation to activate a locking mechanism within the plate to secure the round studs to the plate. Existing machine #1 has (qty 7) machine tables measuring 500mm x 500mm each and must be outfitted with mounting plates. Mounting plates that will be attached to machine #1 must be sized to accommodate the 500mm x 500mm machine table and be able to be mounted to the table in such a way as to allow clamping of a 125mm wide vise in the center of the table and also allow for a double vise setup (using 125mm vises) by moving vises side to side without repositioning the plates that are mounted to the table. Mounting plates must be able to be used with riser devices. It is assumed that 5 mounting plates will be used for each of the machine tables on machine #1 (3 plates for mounting vises and 2 plates for mounting riser devises). Therefore, (qty 35) mounting plates will be required for machine #1. Machine #1 mounting plates must not exceed 500mm overall width when 3 mounting plates are mounted side by side on a 500mm wide machine table. Existing machine #2 has (qty 7) machine tables measuring 350mm x 350mm each and must be outfitted with mounting plates. Mounting plates that will be attached to machine #2 must be sized to accommodate the 350mm x 350mm machine table and be able to be mounted to the table in such a way as to allow clamping of a 125mm wide vise in the center of the table and also allow for a double vise setup (using 125mm vises) by moving vises side to side without repositioning the plates that are mounted to the table. Mounting plates must be able to be used with riser devices. It is assumed that 3 mounting plates will be used for each of the machine tables on machine #2 (2 plates for mounting 2 vises and 1 plate for mounting 1 riser devise). Therefore, (Qty 21) mounting plates will be required for machine #2. Machine #2 mounting plates must not exceed 350mm overall width when 2 mounting plates are mounted side by side on a 350mm wide machine table. (Qty 2) additional mounting plates are required for a wire electrical discharge machine (EDM) setup. These 2 mounting plates must be interchangeable with the other mounting plates supplied and have the same features to allow mounting of a 125mm wide vise via round clamping studs in the vise. All mounting plates shall be made of hardened and ground steel and have a +- .0002 positional repeatability. All mounting plates must be able to support a 125mm wide vise. All mounting plates must have a minimum of 4 counter bores for mounting the plate to a machine table. Riser devises: (Qty 21) Riser devises shall be supplied at a minimum thickness of 100mm. Risers must contain round clamping studs that protrude from the bottom of the riser to act as a manual locking device for supplied mounting plates, and have a +- .0002 positional repeatability. Risers must be configured to allow direct mounting of the riser to the top of the mounting plates and also allow mounting of vises to the top of the riser (via the round studs protruding from the bottom of vise). Risers that will be mounted to machine #1 must not exceed 500mm overall width when 2 risers are mounted side by side on a 500mm wide machine table. (Qty 14) rises are required for machine #1. (Qty 7) rises are required for machine #2. Round mounting plate for 4th axis mill setup: (Qty 1) round steel mounting plate shall be supplied with a minimum diameter of 6.75 inches to enable vises to be mounted to the round plate using the round clamping studs protruding from the bottom of vise. Clamping of vise to round plate shall be by manual actuation to activate a locking mechanism within the plate to secure the round studs to the plate. Round mounting plate must have a minimum of 2 counter bores for mounting the plate to a machine rotary table. Round mounting plate shall be made of hardened and ground steel and have a +- .0002 positional repeatability. Accessories: (qty 1) A Hydraulic stamping unit shall be provided with serrated jaws to stamp indentations on raw stock to match supplied vise jaw serrations (detailed in 1.0.4) to allow secure vise clamping on a minimum amount of raw stock material using the 1/8" step depth of the supplied vises. The Hydraulic stamping unit must exert enough force to allow stamping of stainless steel or aluminum raw stock. (Qty 1) extra set of serrated stamping jaws must be supplied with the Hydraulic stamping unit. (Qty 252) round clamping studs for vises and risers (assuming vises and risers have 4 studs each). NOTE: 252 qty allows for extra clamping studs for future in-house tooling. Delivery: The following items shall be delivered on or before March 23, 2012: (qty 35) mounting plates, (qty 14) 100mm height risers, (qty 14) 125mm wide x 12 inches long centering vises, and (qty 1) stamping unit.

If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis of Government obtained information, additional information in accordance with FAR 15.402(a) may be required from the offeror to support the proposed price.  Unreasonably low or high proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br> Total Evaluated Price - The total evaluated price to be used for the determination of reasonableness will be calculated as follows:  <br>(i).The evaluated price for each CLIN is the unit price proposed for the CLIN multiplied by the quantity specified in the Schedule for that CLIN.   <br>(ii).

<DESC><p>Website Redesign and Upgrade Request for Proposal<br />Prepared by:&nbsp; Jeremy FiveCrows, Visual Information Director</p>
<p>March 6, 2012</p>
<p>Summary and Background</p>
<p>Objective<br />The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC) has set aside funds to redesign and upgrade its website.<br />The current CRITFC website (main site) has extensive static information (upwards of 400 pages) as well as links to a sub-site that provides database-driven dynamic webpages. There is no integrated social or mobile functionality on the main site.</p>
<p>Historical Site Role and Statistics<br />The main site's current role is to provide basic information to the public on the organization, its work, salmon biology, and tribal salmon culture. The site receives between 4,000 to 5,000 visitors per month. The pages with the highest traffic are those dealing with basic tribal information, information on how to buy Indian-caught salmon, and job announcements. The site is an important public access point for intergovernmental salmon management agreements.<br />Audience<br />The current focus of the main site is on providing basic information to the general public at-large and to a subset of the public - the governmental and scientific communities involved in natural resources management and with a particular interest in CRITFC's research and published scientific papers to the scientific community. During the tribal commercial fishery, the site receives a large number of visits from individuals interested in purchasing salmon directly from Indian fishers.<br />Key Features and Technical Environment<br />This main site is almost exclusively written in html and is managed through Dreamweaver. The sub-site (found in the Science section) is housed on a separate server that operates in a .Net en-vironment.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission is an intertribal agency coordinating fisheries management, fisheries research, policy development, and outreach for its four member tribes: the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Umatilla Tribes, the Confederated Warm Springs Tribes, and the Nez Perce Tribe. The organization was founded in 1977 with a mission "to ensure a unified voice in the overall management of the fishery resources, and as managers, to protect reserved treaty rights through the exercise of the inherent sovereign powers of the tribes." In order to accomplish this mission, CRITFC maintains a staff of approximately 100 that is organized into nine departments: the Office of the Executive Director, Fisheries Management, Fishery Science, Fisheries Enforcement, Watershed, Policy Development and Litigation Support, Fishing Site Maintenance, Finance and Operations, and Human Resources. Some of the services provided by the organization include:</p>
<ul class="unIndentedList">
<li>Extensive biological and other scientific research including operating a genetics laboratory in Hagerman, Idaho in conjunction with the University of Idaho.<br /><br />
<p>Fisheries management and harvest monitoring</p>
<p>An enforcement department that provides policing, search and rescue operations, and archeo-logical protection on and near the Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to McNary Dam.</p>
<p>Communications to provide outreach and information to the general public, tribal communities, Indian fishers, and governmental agencies and officials.</p>
<p>Operate and maintain 31 fishing sites along the Columbia River from Bonneville Dam to McNary Dam.</p>
<p>Coordinate and advocate for the restoration of the watersheds where fish live, including research and modeling for the effects of climate change on the Columbia River Basin and the fish that are found in it.</p>
<p>Development and implementation of regional, national, and international policies and laws affecting Columbia River Basin treaty-secured fisheries.</p>
Assist Indian fishers in the marketing and sales of salmon and other commercial fishes.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redesign Purpose, Description, and Objectives</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The primary objective of this redesign is to update the site to a modern system. The current envi-ronment lacks the ability to easily and quickly add new information that connects with the rest of the site in terms of navigation and cross-linking. Only one user currently has access to add and modify information, creating a bottleneck for updates. The site lacks social media connectivity or the capacity to display dynamic data. The organization would like to add secure log-in functionality to offer staff and commissioners access to information and downloads that are proprietary or sensitive, including a connection to CRITFC's intranet site that is used by staff for various internal purposes.</p>
<p>Description<br />For this redesign process, CRITFC staff will be responsible for design decisions and new content creation. CRITFC staff would also be available to coordinate with the contractor to identify ap-propriate links and theme modifications and to establish a seamless connection to CRITFC's dy-namically served sub-site as well as CRITFC's intranet site. The contractor will be expected to provide design options, site organization advice and recommendations, coding to allow secure logins and overall site security, creation of the functioning site, and transferring the content from the current site to the new one. Additionally, the new site's look and feel should easily migrate to the intranet and sub-sites. Depending on the budget, some or most of the content migration can be done by CRITFC staff rather than the contractor.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>Move the main site into a content management system and away from the current Dreamweaver environment. The new system would preferably be an open source solution such as WordPress, Expression Builder, Drupal, Liferay, etc.</p>
<p>Improve the site's functionality and navigability. Since the scope and depth of the information is considerable, the current site suffers from visitors getting lost trying to find information or not able to find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Integrate social media functionality into the redesign, allowing for sharing of and possibly commenting on select pages. A closer tie with the organization's Facebook page and Twitter feed is important.</p>
<p>Improve the presentation of data compiled by CRITFC by creating visually meaningful represen-tations. For example, graphs and numerical daily counts of salmon crossing Columbia River dams are of interest to many tribal and non-tribal site visitors. CRITFC also has developed extensive GIS map information and video content that would be beneficial to include on the new website.</p>
<p>Add secure login, user roles, and security role-based page access for certain portions of the site for calendar and shared documents and ensure these logins can persist to sub-sites, particularly the connection to our intranet site.</p>
<p>Add an RSS news feed, press release feed, and job posting feed.</p>
<p>Add the ability to post restoration project information including details, updates, mapping, and reporting.</p>
<p>Add email newsletter functionality, including a way for visitors to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves.</p>
<p>Provide universal search functionality throughout the site.</p>
<p>Through Google Calendar or another similar free system, provide the ability for visitors to add CRITFC information to their own calendar systems.</p>
<p>Match the design and feel of our print materials, which consists of a more "tribal" feel than the current website.</p>
<p>Create a simplified version of the template for mobile devices. Not all of the site would necessarily need to be offered in a mobile form.</p>
Create a "kid version" of the template with a bright, easy-to-navigate, and simplified subsection.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scope<br />The goal for deployment of this project is September 1, 2012. The project will entail several phases leading up to this deadline. The first phase will be the site analysis and design. The design will be reviewed and ultimately approved by the internal web team and the executive director. In this phase, the following deliverables are expected:</p>

<SUBJECT>Acquisition of Sheep Antisera Against H1N1 pdm Virus for Includsion in Annual WHO Kit
<SOLNBR>000HCVGD-2012-43549
<RESPDATE>031912
<ARCHDATE>03202012
<CONTACT>Linda M Young, Purchasing Agent, Phone (770) 488-2655, Fax (770) 488-2777, Email lml3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Medgene, 1006 32nd Avenue, Suite 104, Brookings, SD 57006, for acquisition of sheep antisera against H1N1 pdm virus for inclusion in the annual World Health Organization (WHO) kit manufactured by Medgene, Inc.<br /><br />Background: CDC manufactures the annual WHO reference reagent kit using inactivated influenza viral preparations and sheep sera against influenza viral proteins. During 2009, when the H1N1 pdm virus emerged, developing antisera against H1N1 pdm became very challenging due to additional cleavage sites in the HA protein resulting in an internally cleaved HA protein resulting in non-immunogenic HA protein particles. South Dakota State University (SDU) maintains a flock of sheep. During the H1N1 pandemic, one subject matter expert in the Influenza Division established a contract with SDU to use recombinant proteins, rather than native proteins, and an alternative approach to a traditional vaccine strategy to generate highly tittered H1N1 pdm antisera that supported the influenza division and FDA with H1N1-specific sera for 2 years. CDC has now exhausted all of their stock of H1N1 pdm sera and desperately needs more sera for in house surveillance to support seasonal annual influenza strain selection and for inclusion in the 2012-13 annual WHO kit.<br /><br />Need: Minimum of 600 mls of sheep antisera against A/H1N1 pdm strain of influenza and a final report. <br /><br />Requirement: 1. Timed sera (20 mls) obtained from bleeds based on the vaccine schedule previously employed to produce antisera to H1N1pm; 2. Final sera (600 mls) upon the determination by CDC SMEs meeting the titers required for use in the WHO kit; 3. Final report.<br /><br />Assumptions and Expectations: 1. All confirmatory testing will be performed at CDC; 2. Immunization schedule has been projected to last longer than expected and may need to be reduced if the resulting titers meet the expectations of the government. CDC will notify SDU with further instructions per the contract based on CDC testing results. Prior to progression to the next step in the progress CDC must be consulted to ensure that the optional titer with the lowest cross reactivity is acquired. 3. If titers are not reached, CDC will accept the final product per the protocol. 4. SDU will acquire the adenoviral construct specific to the H1N1 pdm virus included in the solicitation. 5. SDU will acquire the necessary approvals for the indicated work per the requirements of the Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 6. Vendor will be responsible for shipping costs. 7. CDC will provide sequence for the andeoviral vector and the protein immunogen. Technical requirements and Delivery Schedule: Four (4) sheep will be acquired and maintained during the duration of the experiment. Delivery schedule is as follows: 1. Twenty (20) mls of sheep sera from each animal will be required prior to immunization; 2. Twenty (20) mls of sera from each animal are due two (2) weeks post initial prime dose of immunogen; 3. Twenty (20) mls of sera from each animal are due two (2) weeks post first and second boost doses of immunogen; 4. Twenty (20) mls of sheep sera from each animal are due two (2) weeks post adenoviral vector immunization or third boost of immunogen; 5. Final bleed (minimum of 600 mls of sera) will be due one week after CDC has performed final testing. CDC testing will take a maximum of 2 weeks after receiving the sera post adenoviral vector immunization. 6. Final report documenting the entire process with results of the study to include animal weights, animal ages, clinical signs, and problems encountered, etc. should be included in the report. 7. Shipments of sera should occur immediately post bleed at 4&deg;C.<br /><br />Options: 1. Two (2) of the four (4) sheep will be maintained for an additional 9 months after the initial period of performance. 2. An additional 600 mls of sera may be required. 3. The other two (2) sheep may need to be maintained for an additional year after the award of the contract. 4. Additional immunizations with Adenoviral vector or immunogen.<br /><br />Period of Performance: Base contract: 3 months. Options for maintenance of sheep: additional 9 months. Personnel: Project coordinator which includes data analysis and blood sample collection, and provision of IACUC approval and animal care procedures, injections and blood collections, including final serum collection under general anesthesia; laboratory manager to assist in all bleeds and vaccinations, purification of serum for shipment to CDC, communications assistance, and coordination of project activities, as well as final serum preparation and assistance in procedure using general anesthesia; plus additional technical support for animal capture and care. Sheep to be procured at current lamb prices, four outbred sheep approximately 1-2 years of age.<br /><br />Finished product must function properly in WHO kit by detecting H1N1 pdm field isolates.<br /><br />CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<p>II. Price<br />(i) PRICE ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER TO DETERMINE PRICE REASONABLENESS BY: comparing the total of each line item submitted by the quoters to determine the lowest FOB Destination price for each line item.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only.<BR><BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension.?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>1.  This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation, and award. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

2.  The solicitation number is VA-262-12-R-0547 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). 

3.  The Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulations supplement (VAAR) can be accessed on the Internet at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/ (FAR) and http://vaww.appc1.va.gov/oamm/vaar (VAAR). 

4.  This solicitation is issued as full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 812930, and the size standard is $35.5 million dollars. 

5.  This requirement consists of two (2) line items: 

a. 	Parking lot(s) which can accommodate up to 500 vehicles.

6.  The following STATEMENT OF WORK is a detailed description of the requirements for this solicitation:

a)	PURPOSE. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is starting several construction projects at the VA San Diego Medical Center that will eliminate up to several hundred parking spaces. The construction projects are expected to take up to three years to complete and may be longer depending on a number of unidentified factors. As such, VA seeks to implement temporary parking accommodation through this requirement.  

b)	OBJECTIVE. Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, supplies, services, and security, necessary to provide up to 500 parking spaces to be used by VA personnel, patients, contractors, and visitors for a period of 6 months with the start date of on or about April 1, 2012.

c)	PARKING:

1.	At a minimum, the contractor shall initially provide up to 500 parking spaces for VA use within sixty (60) days after receipt of award.

2.	Contractor shall provide for parking within a five-mile radius from the VA San Diego Medical Center with appropriate options for personnel entering from different commuter areas (such as East/West or North/South arrangements). The minimum size of one parking area is 100 spaces.  

3.	VA must be able to use and have access to parking areas twenty four (24) hours a day seven (7), three hundred sixty five (365) days a year.

4.	The Contractor shall provide a level of security that reasonably deters unauthorized entry throughout the term of the contract. Overall security shall also include deterring loitering or disruptive acts in and around the parking area.  Parking lot shall be well lighted and adequately monitored to prevent unauthorized access.  Contractor shall be responsible to maintain the area and protect the vehicles parked in the parking lot; this includes protection from theft.

5.	The contractor is responsible for providing a method for verifying the space being used by the VA.

The log must be readily available for the VA to review for planning purposes.

6.	The VA shall have the option to request an increase, reduction or allocation in the number of spaces obligated by written notice. The VA may exercise this option at their convenience, with a 30 day notification to the contractor and shall be authorized to request this increase option every 30 days thereafter until completion of the contract. In conjunction with data accrued from the tracking requirements stated in Number 5 above, the VA may

Allocate spaces such that the 500 gross sum of spaces are maintained, but the distribution of spaces is not split even.

d)	TRANSPORTATION/SHUTTLE SERVICE:

Unless a significant price disparity exists which deems a large business suitable for award, award will be made to a small business. Multiple awards will not be considered. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, offerors' initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government.  "Best value" means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In addition to price, when determining best value, the Government may consider, among other factors, past performance, special features of the supply or service required for effective program performance, trade-in considerations, probable life of the item selected as compared with that of a comparable item, warranty considerations, maintenance availability, environmental and energy efficiency considerations, and delivery terms. The Gov't may at its discretion review sources not submitted by the offeror to make their best value determination. Technical and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price. This may result in award being made to a higher-rated, higher-priced offeror. The Government's selection of a higher-priced, higher rated offer will be supported by a determination that the technical/past performance superiority of the higher-priced offer warrants the additional cost involved. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process.  A best value decision will not be reduced to a mechanical, mathematical exercise. <br><br>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, 52.212-4 is amended as follows: Paragraph (g) (1): Change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices.

However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A separate performance work statement (PWS) for each event is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR and DFARS Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, 52.252-1, 252.209-7999 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote on both events.  However, vendors must quote on all services required per event. An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. <br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met:  <br><br>(1) The quote must provide for all lodging, event space, catering and parking requirements within the group.  (2) The facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The facility proposed must be located in the Richmond, VA area (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64) and (5) The facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>FAR provisions 52.212-3, including Alt I and DFARS provision 252.212-7001 shall be completed and returned with your offer.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.  <br><br>DFARS provision 252.209-7999 is provided as additional documentation and must be completed and returned with your offer.<br><br>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <br><br>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be submitted via Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.  No Numbered Notes apply.

52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;  (ii) price;  (iii) past performance to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information);
Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are equal when compared to price.
(b) Options.
 The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Evaluation of Past Performance:  Past performance evaluation is a risk assessment based upon the relevancy of the past performance of the offeror (the offeror signing the offer) as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.
  This includes the measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customer in the past on relevant directly related contracts and subcontracts that are similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to that required by the RFP.  The Government will contact some or all of each offerors customers (referenced in the offer) to ask to what degree, among other things: (1) that the offeror delivered quality services in a timely manner; (2) that the offerors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.

In the case of an offeror (Offer submitting and signing the offer) whose past performance is somehow not similar in scope, or not similar in complexity, or not similar in magnitude, or otherwise lacking relevancy to some degree, then the Government will take this into consideration and evaluate accordingly.
  (This means that a person, the customer, providing information on the offerors past performance may give that offeror an outstanding on an existing or previous contract, but the contract in question is smaller or is otherwise lacking relevancy to the same degree, then the overall rating given by the Government may be lower as it is less relevant.)

In the case of an offeror (Offer submitting and signing the offer) without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government, and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
 Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL
<p>1.1 SCOPE</p>
<p>The National Strike Force (NSF) requires contract support services to provide hazardous materials incident commander training. The Contractor will provide a bid for one (1) year and four (4) optional years.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), is the federal government's blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The NCP is the result of our country's efforts to develop a national response capability and promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans. The NCP includes a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges, in addition to releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>Within the NCP, the NSF Strike Teams (NSFST) are designated as Special Teams required to maintain the standing ability to support Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense predesignated Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) for any discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil into a navigable waterway of the U.S., or a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment of the U.S.</p>
<p>As defined by 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)(6)(v) and NFPA 472 Chapter 3, On-Scene Incident Commanders are members who will assume control of an incident beyond the first responder awareness level, have overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations, and are responsible for the management of all incident operations at the site. Job function examples of positions that require training to this level include but are not limited to On-Scene Coordinators, On-Scene Coordinator Representatives, Incident Command System (ICS) Operations Section Chiefs, ICS Safety Officers, and supervisors/managers. NSF responders being trained to become either a Response Supervisor or Officer are required to be trained to this level due to the potential of filling one of the roles defined above during a hazardous materials or oil spill response.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Each instructor shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1.3.1 Meets all requirements listed for "Trainers" under 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(7).</p>

<p>1.3.3 All instructors, support personnel, and technical assistants shall be familiar with the roles and missions of the Coast Guard National Strike Force.<br />1.3.4 The Contractor shall provide a list of instructors, including copies of resumes and current certifications to the NSF for evaluation as part of the proposal. No changes to the instructors list will be authorized without prior approval from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The Government shall have final approval authority for all instructors supplied by the Contractor.</p>
<p>1.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST. The Contractor shall not employ any person for work under this contract who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or could appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>1.5 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The primary place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility which shall include classrooms, training equipment, and an operational training area as defined in section 4.0 of this task order.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

Federal regulations mandate that 100 percent of the manufactured rock dust material will pass through a sieve having 20 meshes per linear inch and 70 percent or more of which will pass through a sieve having 200 meshes per linear inch.</p>
<p>3.0 Testing and Analysis<br />3.1 Sampling will include approximately 40 samples of limestone material (rock dust). For this set of samples, we are interested in the determination of the amount of material that passes through a 200 mesh sieve. The analysis of these samples has become a high priority so turnaround time is important.<br />3.1.1 Samples delivered will range in weight from approximately 100 grams to 1 pound.<br />3.2 The contractor shall maintain appropriate chain-of-custody, including associated paperwork at all times.<br />3.3 An ISO/CEN 17025 certified contractor is preferred. If possible, sieve testing should be among the fields of testing covered by the scope of the accreditation.<br />3.4 Quality assurance analysis such as duplicate sample determinations, balance calibration verification, and sieve performance (most importantly the minus 200 mesh) are to be included in the quotation.<br />3.4.1 A duplicate analysis is to be completed on every tenth sample and reported.<br />3.4.2 The analytical balances used to weigh the samples must be routinely checked and verified using ASTM certified check weights.<br />3.4.3 The performance of the 200 mesh sieve(s) must be verified using a NIST traceable standard material (RM 8010, D) after every twenty samples.<br />3.5 Analysis is to be performed using ASTM's C110 air jet sieving through 200 mesh sieves.</p>
<p>4.0 Testing Methods<br />4.1 Testing is to be done according to ISO/IEC 17025 standards and ASTM Standard C110-11, Section 18, Dry Screening of Hydrated Lime, Pulverized Quicklime, and Limestone by Air Jet Sieving.<br />4.2 It may be necessary to dry samples after prolonged periods of storage.</p>
<p>5.0 Contractor Provided Items and Services<br />The contractor shall provide the following items and services to the government, to the parties/locations indicated:<br />5.1 Sample analyses reports to be provided within 30 calendar days of sample receipt. Electronic reports shall be in Adobe Acrobat format, digitally signed and e-mailed to: wesolowski.mark@dol.gov.</p>
<p>6.0 Government Provided Items and Services<br />6.1 The government shall provide the labor and equipment needed to obtain and document the samples, including delivery of the samples to the contractor or shipping company drop off point.<br />6.2 Samples to be returned to Mark Wesolowski upon completion of testing via United Parcel Service (UPS) using the Government provided UPS account number for shipping charges.</p>
<p>Period of performance:<br />30 days from receipt of samples.<br /><br />Place of performance:<br />Work will be performed at the selected vendor's location.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Parts 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 of the SOW.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 15, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL
<p>1.1 SCOPE</p>
<p>The National Strike Force (NSF) requires contract support services to provide hazardous materials incident commander training. The Contractor will provide a bid for one (1) year and four (4) optional years.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), is the federal government's blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The NCP is the result of our country's efforts to develop a national response capability and promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans. The NCP includes a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges, in addition to releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>Within the NCP, the NSF Strike Teams (NSFST) are designated as Special Teams required to maintain the standing ability to support Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense predesignated Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) for any discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil into a navigable waterway of the U.S., or a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment of the U.S.</p>
<p>As defined by 29 CFR 1910.120 (q)(6)(v) and NFPA 472 Chapter 3, On-Scene Incident Commanders are members who will assume control of an incident beyond the first responder awareness level, have overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations, and are responsible for the management of all incident operations at the site. Job function examples of positions that require training to this level include but are not limited to On-Scene Coordinators, On-Scene Coordinator Representatives, Incident Command System (ICS) Operations Section Chiefs, ICS Safety Officers, and supervisors/managers. NSF responders being trained to become either a Response Supervisor or Officer are required to be trained to this level due to the potential of filling one of the roles defined above during a hazardous materials or oil spill response.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Each instructor shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1.3.1 Meets all requirements listed for "Trainers" under 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(7).</p>

No changes to the instructors list will be authorized without prior approval from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The Government shall have final approval authority for all instructors supplied by the Contractor.</p>
<p>1.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST. The Contractor shall not employ any person for work under this contract who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or could appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>1.5 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The primary place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility which shall include classrooms, training equipment, and an operational training area as defined in section 4.0 of this task order.</p>

<DESC>1. Contract Information:  Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award one contract to be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  A-E services are required construction phase support services.  Additionally, as an option, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications for projects in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED NC rating tool v2.2 and 2009/v3, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Construction Bulletin No 2014 issued 28 June 2010 and LEED requirements provided by TAM customers.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  One indefinite delivery contract will be negotiated and awarded, each with one base year and four, 1-year option periods.  The amount of this contract will not exceed $90 million over the five year period (presuming the Government elects to exercise all option periods).  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price, labor hour or cost reimbursable task orders.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Services Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work).  Task orders awarded under the contract may occur throughout the US Central Command AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf States, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa.  Selected firms will be required to work in these areas, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and travel to these regions may be required.  FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, is applicable to this contract, as funds are presently not available for this contract.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work that it intends to subcontract.  TAM Subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 5% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Yemen. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The firm will provide local national (LN), third country national (TCN), and/or US citizen subject matter experts to perform on-site construction phase support services for assigned projects in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).The positions for LN and TCN shall replicate typical foreign national service (FNS) employee positions obtained by U.S. Government Agencies to support overseas projects and locations.  TAM requires Construction Managers, Construction Schedulers, Data Managers, Office Managers, Project Engineers and Quality Assurance Representatives. These employees will gather information on contractor performance and report this information back to Government personnel. Government personnel will retain final decision-making authority on contractor performance. All work will be submitted in hardcopy format and/or through an automated system to Government personnel designed in each task order. As an option in this contract, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications.  3. SOURCE SELECTION CRITERIA:  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit (1) a Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineering Qualifications, Part I and II, and (2) any requested supplemental data to the procurement office shown below.  Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection.  The selection criteria for this co are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria (a) through (e) are primary.

The contractor will support research studies on environmental and occupational exposures, particularly in deployed environments, in order to identify toxic effects before health and operational performance is compromised in the warfighter.
 This research effort will require the accumulation and analysis of data, computer programming, and statistical analysis. As an integral portion of these research activities, the contractor shall be expected to support and perform daily routine set-ups and maintenance of critical human experimental devices at NAMRU-D. These devices include the Disorientation Research Device (DRD), the Visual Vestibular Sphere Device (VVSD), the Vertical Linear Accelerator (VLA), as well as other aircraft motion and orientation simulators.

Work also includes assisting in preparation of grant applications for other psychological, medical, and performance studies. Contractor shall support coordination with other Navy commands when necessary to complete the various research programs in place.
 Preparation of survey materials and psychological assessment materials, conducting literature reviews and preparation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) materials shall also be required.

The maximum not-to-exceed amount for the contract is $12,849,694.76. Work is expected to be completed March 2017. This contract was solicited using full and open competition, with 9 offers received. The Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, Md., is the contracting activity.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Justification for Other Than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>PR# 21-12-442PCZ184</p>
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5 and Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, this justification for other than full and open competition is supported by the following facts and rationale using the format prescribed in FAR 6.302-2.</p>
<p>1. Agency and contracting activity: The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center (C3CEN).</p>
<p>2. Nature/description of the action being approved: The U.S. Coast Guard C3CEN Electronics Repair Facility (ERF) has a requirement, to purchase on a sole source basis, for the purchase of a PCS-200 Radar Simulator to be used in support of Centralized Depot repair within the Electronics Repair Facility. Buffalo Computer Graphics is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and will Install, Test and Train personnel on the system integration that is part of the AN/SPS-73 Tech Refresh and Bridgemaster E Radar System. This System will also enable synchronization with established AN/SPS-73 radar systems to increase effectiveness of Depot Repair within the ERF. The Procurement Branch, C3CEN, Portsmouth, VA will award the contract.</p>
<p>3. Description of supplies/services: A Purchase Request will be issued for the purchase of: one (1) each, PCS-200 Radar Simulator, Part Number 01-210738; one (1) each, Enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI2) Part Number 51-210937; one (1) Bridgemaster-E Interface option, Part Number 05-410238-3; one (1) Onsite Installation and Training ; manufactured by Buffalo Computer Graphics Incorporated, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The requested System is to be used exclusively to provide live inputs into the AN/SPS-73 Tech Refresh, and Bridgemaster-E Radar.</p>
<p>4. Identification of the justification and the rationale: This statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) implemented by FAR Subpart 6.302-1, entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of authority cited: The PCS-200 is the only known graphic simulator found on the market that 1) interfaces with the AN/SPS-73 Radar System and the Bridgemaster E (BME) Radar System, and 2) meets all minimum quality assurance standards set by C3CEN Navigation-Sensors Core Technology Branch, CT-N2. In addition, the PCS-200 Graphics Simulator aids in technical analysis and in support of both the AN/SPS-73 and Bridgemaster E Radar Systems to ensure that both radar systems, sub-system, assemblies, sub-assemblies and associated circuit cards meets the minimum quality assurance standards set by the US Coast Guard. Any variances could adversely impact the ERF's ability to meet USCG minimum safety requirements and ensure mission performance.</p>
<p>6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: In accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2, in an effort to solicit as many potential sources as practical, a RFQ will be posted on FEDBIZOPS, with the statement that any Offerors that feel that they can provide the Exact Items and Services as listed, are encouraged to respond to the RFQ.</p>
<p>7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable: The Contracting Officer will determine fair and reasonableness based on previous acquisitions and Gov/USCG Cost Estimates.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research: Market research as prescribed in FAR Part 10 was conducted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. The Internet was searched using the technical information required for the use of radar video simulation. The Market Research showed that Buffalo Computer Graphics could meet the minimum Technical Specifications to ensure compatibility with existing Electronic and Mechanical Circuitry and to ensure that safe operational parameters are maintained.</p>
<p><br />9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: The ERF has invested over $100,000.00 dollars in previously purchased PCS-100 and PCS-200 Radar Simulators. In addition, the Technical Specifications and Supplementary Data are Proprietary to the OEM, Buffalo Computer Graphics, and cannot be provided to other Manufacturers. The alternative would be to change to another system which would not be cost effective.</p>
<p>10. Listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: No sources expressed an interest in this solicitation.</p>
<p>11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for supplies or services required: Recommend no actions be taken at this time to overcome barriers barring full and open competition.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification: I certify that this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p align="left">Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p align="left">2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S):</p>
<p align="left">The purpose of this action is to obtain approval for a class justification to contract with</p>
<p align="left">AT&amp;T for the lease of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Alert Network (CJCSAN)</p>
<p align="left">equipment and the associated transmission circuits. CJCSAN is comprised of a primary</p>
<p align="left">and alternate voice conference network located at Waldorf, MD and Raleigh, NC</p>
<p align="left">respectively. Each network has a conference "W" switch, dedicated 3 Kb voice circuits,</p>
<p align="left">and three 1.544Mb (T1) circuits connecting the CJCSAN conference switch to the</p>
<p align="left">dedicated network. In the past J&amp;As were requested and approved for CJCSAN.</p>
<p align="left">CJCSAN is due for re-award. CJCSAN was built in the 1960s. The technology and</p>
<p align="left">capability of the legacy system is reliable and functionally intact. CJCSAN is not web</p>
<p align="left">based and is not subject to the problems associated with the web. The current CJCSAN</p>
<p align="left">circuits had an approved sole source J&amp;A to award circuits to AT&amp;T. The DTS-CE</p>
<p align="left">contract was used as a vehicle to award circuits to AT&amp;T. The AT&amp;T circuits supporting</p>
<p align="left">CJCSAN network must be transitioned off the DTS-CE contract by its expiration date of</p>
<p align="left">2</p>
<p align="left">March 2012. The DISN Access Transport Systems (DATS) contract cannot be used as a</p>
<p align="left">contracting vehicle. The DATS contract is divided into regions. AT&amp;T is awarded only</p>
<p align="left">one of those regions. AT&amp;T as the incumbent would lose sole source access to circuits</p>
<p align="left">outside of their region. There is no other available follow-on contract at this time.</p>
<p align="left">Approval of this J&amp;A will permit the award of contracts to the incumbent vendor, AT&amp;T,</p>
<p align="left">via individual Communication Service Authorizations (CSAs). This will allow AT&amp;T to</p>
<p align="left">continue to provide highly reliable, critical conferencing capability to the National</p>
<p align="left">Command Authority, Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant Commanders.</p>
<p align="left">3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:</p>
<p align="left">A. CJCSAN is an AT&amp;T leased, non-secure, voice circuit network originally fielded in</p>
<p align="left">the 1960s which is still used for time critical Nuclear Command and Control (NC2)</p>
<p align="left">communications. This network provides rapid and reliable conferencing capability</p>
<p align="left">between the National Command Authority, National Military Command Center (NMCC),</p>
<p align="left">United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), other Combat Commanders and</p>
<p align="left">their subordinate military commands. While the technology and capability of the legacy</p>
<p align="left">systems are over 40 years old, its reliability and functionality are intact.</p>
<p align="left">B. CJCSAN consists of conference switches located at two locations. Each switch is</p>
<p align="left">connected to different DSN circuits and, the switches are controlled from multiple sites.</p>
<p align="left">Should a problem occur, only Site-R or USSTRATCOM can take over control of the</p>
<p align="left">CJCSAN conference. The essential CJCSAN components are a primary and secondary</p>
<p align="left">AT&amp;T switches located at one of the following locations; AT&amp;T Special Government</p>
<p align="left">Operations Center (SGOC) at Waldorf MD and the AT&amp;T Center at Raleigh NC. These</p>
<p align="left">switches allow one of the three main control sites to manage the CJCSAN voice traffic</p>
<p align="left">via a priority hierarchy that allows control of the conference calls. Due to criticality and</p>
<p align="left">sensitivity of the missions associated with CJCSAN, it is imperative that customers</p>
<p align="left">contact a single location (SGOC) for network management, system and circuit</p>
<p align="left">troubleshooting, and all equipment and system maintenance.</p>
<p align="left">C. The CJCSAN conferencing capability and connectivity is critical in conducting</p>
<p align="left">day-to-day activities, contingency operations and when the U.S. is under hostile attack.</p>
<p align="left">This class justification is to provide the basis for the re-award of CJCSAN AT&amp;T switch</p>
<p align="left">equipment and circuits contracts. CJCSAN has a total of 30 circuits with Communication</p>
<p align="left">Service Authorizations (CSA). A list of current CSAs and CCSDs is attached. The long</p>
<p align="left">haul service orders under the DTS-CE contract expire March 2012. The continuation of</p>
<p align="left">service via new individual CSAs contracts is included in this J&amp;A.</p>
<p align="left">3</p>
<p align="left">D. This class justification will be in effect for 60 months. Individual contracts/CSAs</p>
<p align="left">will contain a standard provision to disconnect circuits with one month notice and no</p>
<p align="left">financial penalty to the government.</p>
<p align="left">E. The forecasted cost for CJCSAN is based on an estimated service life of 60 months.</p>
<p align="left">An attached spreadsheet includes 30 current contracts/CSAs. These circuits are funded</p>
<p align="left">on the firm-fixed price DTS-CE CSA and individual CSA contracts. In summary:</p>
<p align="left">(REDACT)</p>
<p align="left">4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY.</p>
<p align="left">10 U.S.C.2304(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will</p>
<p align="left">satisfy agency requirements, (FAR 6.302-1/DFARS 206.302-1).</p>
<p align="left">5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p align="left">A. The legacy capability needs to remain in-place until a suitable replacement has been</p>
<p align="left">engineered, fielded, tested, and mission certified. Due to the criticality and time</p>
<p align="left">sensitivity of the missions supported by the CJCSAN conferencing system it is</p>
<p align="left">imperative the network is managed and maintained by a single contractor. AT&amp;T</p>
<p align="left">provides a 24 hour a day Special Government Operating Center (SGOC) that supports</p>
<p align="left">other National Command Authority (NCA) Command and Control networks. The SGOC</p>
<p align="left">provide a level of security required for this mission set. The Network at Waldorf, MD is</p>
<p align="left">located in AT&amp;T's Special Government Operations Center (SGOC), facility. This colocation</p>
<p align="left">provides the survivability of the conferencing capability during natural and manmade</p>
<p align="left">disasters. The SGOC at Waldorf is a secure facility with access to backup power</p>
<p align="left">and AT&amp;T maintenance personnel 24-hours a day. The co-location of the CJCSAN</p>
<p align="left">network with AT&amp;T maintenance personnel enables circuit and conference problems to</p>
<p align="left">be quickly resolved. Access to maintenance support is a key factor in achieving a high</p>
<p align="left">level of service availability and reliability required for this mission. This co-location</p>
<p align="left">would not be possible if another vendor is awarded circuit contracts. This co-location</p>
<p align="left">alleviates duplication cost for additional secure facility. Also, the government is not</p>
<p align="left">responsible for configuration management, documentation or schematics required for</p>
<p align="left">fault identification or repair; a service AT&amp;T provides at no additional cost.</p>
<p align="left">B. For over forty years the current contractor has provided the functionality and features</p>
<p align="left">the operators require to effectively manage time sensitive conferences between the NCA</p>
<p align="left">and strategic military forces. The contractor provided a zero threat network configuration</p>
<p align="left">using non-IP based primary and backup switch systems along with legacy transport</p>
<p align="left">circuits and network central office equipment (NCOE). The use of leased circuits along</p>
<p align="left">with the military features of Multilevel Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) ensures the</p>
<p align="left">zero threat environment is carried end-to-end. An award to any contractor other than</p>
<p align="left">AT&amp;T would result in loss of system survivability, security, operation performance and</p>
<p align="left">access to round the clock maintenance. This would result in increased cost associated</p>
<p align="left">with the ability of a vendor having to provide multiple survivable, secure, round the clock</p>
<p align="left">4</p>
<p align="left">maintenance supported locations to assure sustained bridge operation. To transition to a</p>
<p align="left">new vendor, dual operations would be required until the new vendors' system has</p>
<p align="left">achieved operational capability and mission certification. (REDACT)</p>
<p align="left">5</p>
<p align="left">C. As a component of national survival, the CJCSAN sytems requires positive assured</p>
<p align="left">conference connectivity in time of crisis. For another vendor to take over CJCSAN, they</p>
<p align="left">would have to:</p>
<p align="left">(1). Replace the 24 hours network control center at Waldorf, MD and replace the</p>
<p align="left">alternate location in Raleigh, NC for the secondary circuit connectivity.</p>
<p align="left">(2). Locate suitable secure, protected, and survivable locations for the conference</p>
<p align="left">bridges.</p>
<p align="left">(3). Find a conference bridge that can obtain JITC and operational mission certifications,</p>
<p align="left">and demonstrate the bridge will meet the mission requirements.</p>
<p align="left">(4). Obtain a suitable non-IP based replacement for W Switches.</p>
<p align="left">(5). Ensure bridge and circuit performance is monitored 24-hours a day to insure the</p>
<p align="left">availability of the conferencing capability to meet the needs of the NCA, JCS and</p>
<p align="left">Combatant Commanders during time of crisis.</p>
<p align="left">(6). Have personnel available on a 24-hour , seven days a week basis to perform end to</p>
<p align="left">end engineering support to the base level requirement and provide fault level isolation to</p>
<p align="left">ensure the service provides 99.99% availability.</p>
<p align="left">(7). Provide similar hardening and survivability of new conferencing locations. Today</p>
<p align="left">the secure, survivable facility is located at Waldorf, MD and houses numerous AT&amp;T</p>
<p align="left">programs supporting POTUS, USSTRATCOM and JCS. CJCSAN takes advantage of</p>
<p align="left">the facility constructed to meet multiple purposes. A new vendor, if the facility is not</p>
<p align="left">already existing, would require facility modifications to conform to DODI 8500.01A</p>
<p align="left">security standards and provide the ability to sustain operation during periods of high</p>
<p align="left">stress (capable to provide survivable and sustainable communications) in protecting the</p>
<p align="left">Nation.</p>
<p align="left">D. If the circuits were awarded to another vendor, the following "best scenario" delays</p>
<p align="left">could be encountered:</p>
<p align="left">(1). The contractor would be required to locate the conference bridges in protected,</p>
<p align="left">secure facilities with access to backup power and to their longhaul network and</p>
<p align="left">maintainers for sustained operation. The location must be approved by the JCS and</p>
<p align="left">Combatant Commanders.</p>
<p align="left">(2). A new contractor would be required to construct or purchase a new non-IP based,</p>
<p align="left">JITC certified conference bridges, and demonstrate the bridges and their longhaul</p>
<p align="left">network, meet the requirements of the NCA, JCS and Combat Commanders for the EAM</p>
<p align="left">mission. The estimated time required to have bridges approved by the Joint Staff and</p>
<p align="left">Combatant Commanders is 24-36 months. This does not include the time to develop a</p>
<p align="left">consolidated Performance Work Statement approved by all conference bridge users.</p>
<p align="left">(3). Circuits supporting CJCSAN must be replaced. Currently there are 30 circuits. The</p>
<p align="left">time for submitting Telecommunication Requests, contractor circuit engineering, testing,</p>
<p align="left">and delivery is estimated to be another 6-12 months. This does not include any time for</p>
<p align="left">contractor build-out work if facilities do not exist in the contractor's network.</p>
<p align="left">(4). This "best scenario" barring any unforeseen problems in establishing the network</p>
<p align="left">could result in the customer being without the CJCSAN network for at least 36 months</p>
<p align="left">resulting in grave impact on the mission or mission failures to include mass destruction or</p>
<p align="left">death. Divulgence of the grave mission impact would compromise tactics and procedures</p>
<p align="left">cited in classified Emergency Action procedure documents.</p>
<p align="left">6</p>
<p align="left">6. FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT/POTENTIAL SOURCES:</p>
<p align="left">A notice was published in the FedBizOpps 5 Dec 11 as required by FAR Subpart 5.2.</p>
<p align="left">The notice will state the U.S. Government intends to issue a sole source contract to</p>
<p align="left">AT&amp;T to operate and maintain the CJCSAN network to provide critical command and</p>
<p align="left">control communications. The CJCSAN network consists of multiple points located</p>
<p align="left">throughout the Unites States. No responses were received. Any future responses</p>
<p align="left">received in response to the FedBizOpps notice will be given due consideration by the</p>
<p align="left">contracting officer as required by law.</p>
<p align="left">7. DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:</p>
<p align="left">The contracting officer will make a determination that the anticipated cost of circuit</p>
<p align="left">connectivity is fair and reasonable based upon similar requirements of the same circuit</p>
<p align="left">size, installed in similar locations.</p>
<p align="left">8. MARKET RESEARCH:</p>
<p align="left">An 844 CS market survey was conducted by contacting Government and industry experts</p>
<p align="left">and research was conducted via fielding technical proposals to determine if there were</p>
<p align="left">any alternatives in the marketplace that could provide the unique communications</p>
<p align="left">capabilities provided by the CJCSAN network. The market analysis was conducted from</p>
<p align="left">March to October 2011 revealed that no other commercial or military service could</p>
<p align="left">provide the services CJCSAN currently delivers to DoD and Joint Staff senior leaders.</p>
<p align="left">One commercial vendor, Raytheon, could supply the conference switch infrastructure but</p>
<p align="left">could not supply or maintain the required dedicated circuit network. A single vendor</p>
<p align="left">needs to be responsible to provide equipment and longhaul connectivity. It's critical a</p>
<p align="left">single vendor or point of contact immediately respond in the event of outages or events</p>
<p align="left">involving equipment and longhaul connection failures. The current availability of other</p>
<p align="left">command and control conferencing networks does not exist primarily due to the expense</p>
<p align="left">necessary for creating and maintaining the infrastructure that has been created over the</p>
<p align="left">years and the exclusive nature of the CJCSAN design and equipment. To date, we have</p>
<p align="left">found no other provisioning solution utilizing market research.</p>
<p align="left">9. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS:</p>
<p align="left">Due to the criticality and sensitivity of the missions associated with CJCSAN, it is</p>
<p align="left">imperative a single contractor manage the system, controls the circuits and all CJCSAN</p>
<p align="left">equipment, and conducts maintenance. Circuit performance is currently being monitored</p>
<p align="left">by dedicated AT&amp;T personnel 24 hours a day, seven days-a-week 365 days-a-year.</p>
<p align="left">Trouble reporting is accomplished through the AT&amp;T SGOC at Waldorf MD. AT&amp;T's</p>
<p align="left">security policy prohibits non-AT&amp;T contractors from entering their facilities to conduct</p>
<p align="left">installation or maintenance on AT&amp;T proprietary equipment.</p>
<p align="left">7</p>
<p align="left">10. LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES:</p>
<p align="left">There has been a FedBizOpps posting 5 Dec 11 and the Contracting Officer will afford</p>
<p align="left">any potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond.</p>
<p align="left">11. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:</p>
<p align="left">As previously stated AT&amp;T provides the switch and longhaul connections to two control</p>
<p align="left">sites. In order to remove barriers to competition we plan to pursue removing the services</p>
<p align="left">from the vendor's facilities and housing the conference control sites in government</p>
<p align="left">facilities. This action will permit access to multiple vendors to the government's long</p>
<p align="left">haul infrastructure.</p>
<p align="left">The actions identified below show the user's intent to reach an optimal solution which</p>
<p align="left">maintains operational needs while removing barriers to competition. Some of the actions</p>
<p align="left">below are occurring at this time to provide opportunities to pursue alternate technical</p>
<p align="left">solutions. A solution to house the capability on a Military facility through its switch</p>
<p align="left">could utilize leased or DISN infrastructure. As part of the ongoing process, a solution</p>
<p align="left">reflecting these parameters has been developed and has been presented to the Joint Staff,</p>
<p align="left">STRATCOM/J6 and DISA.</p>
<p align="left">The optimal solution is a government owned conference bridge connected to control</p>
<p align="left">site(s) and using the DISN network. The user community (USSTRATCOM and the Joint</p>
<p align="left">Staff) intend to ratify their Conference Bridge requirements. The National Military</p>
<p align="left">Command System engineering community follows up by developing, collaboratively or</p>
<p align="left">separately, a technical approach meeting the user's requirements. The conference switch,</p>
<p align="left">currently the W-Switch, is integral to the operation of the system. This action should</p>
<p align="left">include a Defense Industry Solicitation to vendors. The solicitation is expected to meet</p>
<p align="left">the technical parameters to support the Joint Staff and USSTRATCOM, offer a zero risk</p>
<p align="left">solution, and include Emergency Action Message (EAM) certification. The next action</p>
<p align="left">should be to identify a conference bridge with preference to procurement versus setting</p>
<p align="left">up leased bridges with conference control from a long haul vendor. The conference</p>
<p align="left">bridge must be JITC certified prior to demonstration, be on the Unified Capabilities (UC)</p>
<p align="left">Approved Products List and be UC Certified. Additionally the bridges must have the</p>
<p align="left">ability to meet the mission technical performance criteria. Housing the equipment,</p>
<p align="left">especially the conference bridge and conference control switch, in a government facility</p>
<p align="left">enables more vendors to provide connectivity. Housing the conference control switches</p>
<p align="left">in government facilities also permits access to the government's long haul infrastructure,</p>
<p align="left">further reducing the cost while enhancing competition. The next action should be to</p>
<p align="left">request a lease versus purchase cost study for the conference system. The final</p>
<p align="left">configuration would only require long haul leases that could be delivered by any carrier.</p>
<p align="left">The past DISA Transport Service contract had the provision to acquire or lease</p>
<p align="left">equipment not associated with the long haul requirement. This process should lead to</p>
<p align="left">demonstrating a selected conference bridge solution. This includes confirming the</p>
<p align="left">network configuration meets EAM capability for certification.</p>
<p align="left">8</p>
<p align="left">Technology improvements and communications requirement changes will be evaluated</p>
<p align="left">by DISA/GE-242 (CJCSAN Systems Engineer) the requiring activities,</p>
<p align="left">USSTRATCOM J6 and Air Force Pentagon, 844 CG, on a continuing basis to determine</p>
<p align="left">if technology advances will eliminate existing barriers to competition. Our approach</p>
<p align="left">seeks convergence to DOD Unified Capabilities policy while meeting user requirements.</p>
<p align="left">When transitioning from the current system, individual CSAs include provisions that</p>
<p align="left">allow them to be disconnected on 30 day notice without penalty.</p>
