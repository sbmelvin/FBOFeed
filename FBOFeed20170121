<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a solicitation or request for quotes and no contract or purchase order will be awarded from this notice. There is no solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time.
<p>Military Sealift Command is seeking eligible businesses that can provide parts and services to support overhaul and repairs to the main propulsion diesel engines (MPDEs) installed aboard T-AKE class vessels. There are currently fourteen (14) active T-AKEs in the MSC fleet with two (2) MAN 8L 48/60 and two (2) 9L 48/60 four-stroke turbocharged diesel engines per vessel. The engine Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is MAN Diesel, Germany, for the T-AKE class ships. Proper refurbishment and maintenance of the engines are critical to the safe operation of the T-AKE vessels. The OEM parts and technical data/drawings from the original manufacturer are required by USCG and ABS regulations. This maintains all OEM warranties, ensures engine reliability and crew safety, therefore precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. The engineering, construction drawings and technical characteristics for the manufactured parts for these propulsion engines are proprietary to MAN Diesel, Germany and the US Government did not acquire rights in this data.</p>
<p>T-AKE engines require special tools, specialized repair parts, and technical expertise unique to these engines; only approved OEM parts are authorized to be installed on this highly sophisticated equipment. The OEM Representative has access to provide parts and technical data / drawings from the original manufacturer, as required to properly repair and maintain the equipment. All OEM repair parts are in compliance with USCG and ABS IMO regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>All businesses are encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought. The appropriate NAICS Code is 333618. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE OR PROPOSAL.

The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.</p>
<p>It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting officer a brief capabilities package demonstrating ability to provide the requested items. This document shall address, as a minimum the following: (1) Company Profile, office location(s), DUNS number, and CAGE Code; (2) Licensing Agreement with MAN Diesel for the specific engines.</p>
<p>RESPONSES ARE DUE on Monday, January 30, 2017 by 9:00 AM Eastern Standard Time. Responses shall be sent via e-mail to the following address john.harrison@navy.mil.
