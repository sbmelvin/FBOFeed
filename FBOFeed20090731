<p>(0007) Storm Drainage: The contractor shall design and construct a new storm drainage system that shall be located over an existing earthen channel located on the North West side of the runway. The upstream end of the new storm drainage system begins at the existing outfall at the east end of the channel. The contractor shall remove the existing headwall, and replace with a concrete junction box, either a cast-in-place or precast as appropriate to the design. The new junction box shall create a connection between the existing and new drainage system. The contractor shall size the concrete storm drain (box or RAP) to accommodate the 25 year ultimate developed flow both from the existing storm drain and from the overland flow adjacent to the channel. The drain shall extend at a minimum beyond the primary surface of the runway (about 625ft from the end of the existing system). The horizontal alignment of the drain shall remain as much as possible within the alignment of the existing channel. The inlets shall be sized accordingly and placed appropriately along the culvert to accept upstream overland flow. Minimal grading shall be required to direct overland flow to an inlet. The system shall have a minimal impact on downstream channels and structures. The contractor shall provide a design that includes all calculations for hydrology and hydraulics. These calculations along with a detailed analysis shall be included as a drainage report that shall be included with the set of drawings. The drawings shall include details and designs for all structures within the project. The contractor shall provide a plan and profile that shall be part of the design, and shall indicate both the HGL and EGL within the system. The coordinate systems for the drainage system shall be NAD83 for horizontal and NAUD 88 for vertical.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY

Using Recovery Act funding, the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Assisted Acquisition Service (AAS) intends to modify existing GSA Task Number ME758700T6, a competitively awarded, Time and Materials Task Order under GSA Millennia Lite GWAC for the Indian Health Service (IHS) Office of Information Technology (OIT) Enterprise Investment, Project Management and Documentation Support Services.  This action is created to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery and provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in science and health.  The current contractor is SI INTERNATIONAL INC. headquartered in Atlanta GA.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the Task Order.  

This existing contract must be used because the additional requirements are within the scope of the original award and for efficiency and economy the Governments best interest would be served.  

Specific requirements include:

Projects to be supported with this modification include:
a.	Health Information Technology (HIT) application development and enhancements
b.	HIT infrastructure

Objectives of these projects include:
a.	HIT applications
	RPMS Electronic Health Record (EHR) Modernization
	Personal Health Record Acquisition
	Population Health Application Enhancements
	Practice Management System Acquisition
	Behavioral Health EHR
	RPMS Architecture Enhancements

b.	HIT infrastructure
	Security Enhancements
	Network upgrades
	Digital Radiology and PACS systems 
	Video teleconferencing for healthcare delivery


The requirements of this modification are included in the Projects and Activities section of the IHS Health Information Technology Recovery Plan listed here:

1.	Expand Use of Certified Electronic Health Record
o	Comprehensive Health Information
Improving capabilities across the RPMS suite, including clinical care, support services, and practice management, including activities to address the ease of implementation, support, and usability of the system.
o	Provider Order Entry
Continued improvements to applications that support the communication of orders and consultations among members of the health care team both on site and remotely, including electronic prescribing.
o	Clinical Decision Support
Creating and acquiring clinical decision support tools that build additional intelligence into RPMS, supporting quality of care and patient safety.
o	Quality and Performance Reporting
Expanding existing quality and performance reporting capabilities, and ensuring that quality and performance data are transparent and accessible to consumers of IHS health care services.
o	Health Information Exchange
Activities to ensure that RPMS meets national interoperability standards, and that facilities using RPMS are positioned to participate in exchanges such as the Nationwide Health Information Network.
o	Certification
Ensuring that RPMS receives national certification as a qualified EHR for inpatient use and for behavioral health settings, and continued certification as an outpatient EHR solution.
o	Deployment
Intensive support for the deployment of RPMS EHR in all Federal and Tribal inpatient facilities, and optimization of implementation in outpatient settings as well.

2.	Personal Health Record Adoption   
Development and collaborations to create truly consumer-oriented tools for management and portability of personal health information.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act Funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and the maximum extent practicable, making Fixed Price (FP) awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although GSAs Task Order was not awarded as an FP contract, it was awarded competitively and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance given the specific requirements.  The existing contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Governments risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, modification of this existing Task order is the most appropriate method to accomplish the work anticipated.

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), will be seeking proposals from qualified organizations with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) capable of conducting all aspects (administrative guidance, oversight, and support) of a multi-center Randomized Evaluation of VAD InterVEntion before Inotropic Therapy (REVIVE-IT) feasibility clinical study. 

This acquisition has not been designated a type of set aside, this information will be available upon solicitation posting. It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement contract award for a period of five years will be made. THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals will be available on or about July 23, 2009. The estimated due date for proposals is December 9, 2009. 

Background

The purpose of this clinical feasibility study is to explore the potential benefit of mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices (VADs) in functionally-impaired advanced heart failure patients who have not yet developed serious consequences from their disease.  The study will serve to inform a pivotal trial directed at a large and growing patient population for whom VADs could offer substantial benefit beyond current medical therapies.  

Project Requirements

The clinical study to be developed will test the hypothesis that VAD therapy improves both survival and quality of life in those advanced heart failure patients who are neither inotrope-dependent nor exercise-intolerant and have not yet developed serious consequences such as malnourishment, end-organ damage, and immobility.  The recommendations made by the NHLBI Working Group on the Clinical Use of VADs are given below.  

 Study hypothesis: VAD therapy in the proposed patient population will improve functional status at 12 months post-randomization and all cause mortality will be no worse than that in the optimal medical management arm of the study. 
 Patients for the study should be ill enough to potentially experience both functional and survival benefits from the therapy without undue risk. 
 The estimated mortality rate for this group should be 20%- 30% at one year. 
 Patient Population Inclusion Criteria includes (1) hospitalization in past 6 months, (2) NYHA Class IV or Advanced Class III, (3) maximal evidence-based therapies for 3 months, (4) duration of heart failure of at least a year, and (5) no inotropic support for 30 days prior to enrollment.
 The study should be randomized between VAD and optimal medical management (OMM) arms
 The primary endpoint should be a composite of survival and functional status where the improvement in functional status would need to be substantial and assessed through objective metrics.
 Secondary endpoints are safety, secondary functional and physiologic markers, quality of life, neurocognition, and cost and cost effectiveness.
 Patients should be followed for at least two years.
 Substantial evidence of acceptable clinical performance is required for VADs to be used in the study. 

The DCC is expected to develop the clinical study plan (including specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and rationale, device(s) for the VAD therapy arm of the clinical study, adverse event definitions, and functional, quality of life, and neurocognitive measures), a draft protocol, negotiate and obtain signed contracts/agreements with clinical sites and industry partners. 

Required activities by the DCC include, but are not limited to, (1) finalizing all details of the clinical study to provide evidence for the proposed hypothesis and to assess recruitment and data quality; (2) finalizing the clinical protocol and protocol-related documents (e.g. informed consent form, case report forms, etc.); (3) implementation and conduct of the clinical study in accordance with all Federal requirements; (4) management and oversight of the conduct of the clinical study; (5) providing clinical research support services; (6) providing monitoring and safety oversight; (7) providing site training and support; (8) organizing investigator and DSMB meetings and teleconferences; (9) recruiting and randomizing patients; (10) organizing, conducting, and reimbursing for patient protocol evaluations and tests (including follow-up); and (11) analyzing the data and authoring and submitting papers on the study for publication.

The LVAC shall be an electric and self powered unit required to operate at shore facilities and remote sites.
	
Both ACs are to provide conditioned air at the end of a 30 ft duct at a temperature of 40 deg F, with variable pressure between 0-5.75 psig, and variable air flow between 25 - 87 pounds per minute (ppm).  The units shall be capable of operating as a dehumidifier delivering air at 90 deg F, 30% relative humidity, with an ambient temperature of 105 deg F and 50% relative humidity.  The units require a mobile platform, towable at 15 mph, capable of being lifted by forklift and/or sling, have a ground clearance of at least 7.5, and be transportable by truck, rail and air (C-5, C-17, C-130).  In addition, the SVACs size shall be limited to 98 L x 72 W x 42 H and 4,500 lbs; the LVACs width shall be no greater than 90 (smaller and lighter preferred).  The units shall be capable of operating in temperatures ranging from 0 deg F to 140 deg F (LVAC), and 0 deg F to 125 deg F (SVAC).  The units shall operate on electric power input of 440 VAC, 60 Hz, 100 AMP, 3 phase.  The units shall be of rugged design and shall meet environmental, EMI and mobility criteria.  The units shall be capable of being transported off-road by wheeled vehicles without sustaining damage.  The SVAC shall also meet vibration (per Mil-Std-167) and shock (per Mil-S-901) requirements.  As required for any typical Navy Support Equipment (SE), the units shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.  Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extent possible to make the new LVAC and SVAC a user friendly piece of support equipment.  It is anticipated that the contract will be fixed price, and the government intends to procure 4 pilot production units of each variant and the associated technical and logistics data and training as part of the basic quantity.  The pilot production units are to be used for pilot production testing and government suitability and supportability evaluation/approval testing.  There will be delivery orders for a total of up to 180 LVAC units and 60 SVAC units.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to award a contract to provide engineering and design services of a technical nature in the area of Mobile Cleaning, Recovery, and Reclaim System (MCRRS) Modernization.  The intended period of performance is from the date of award through 18 months thereafter.  NSWCCD intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Completion) type contract to Triverus, LLC of Palmer, AK.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
The MCRRS project is an ongoing Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) effort under Navy SBIR Topic No. NO2-079.  This procurement will provide required modernizations to the MCRRS in preparation for the demonstration and long term evaluation phase of the project.  It is not feasible to have another source provide these services because Triverus, LLC is the manufacturer of the prototype and has proprietary data required for the modernization of the system.  At this stage of the project award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.
The RFP will be issued on or about 14 August 2009 to Triverus, LLC, and the date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days thereafter.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by this agency.  See note (22).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>RECOVERY - BATTERY, LEAD ACID 12 VDC
The Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has a requirement for 12 VDC maintenance free lead acid batteries, marine deep cycle, or deep cycle.
The Government anticipates award of a commercial, Firm-Fixed Price type contract.  Battery deliveries will be variable depending on installation schedules, with the final deliveries anticipated to occur by September 30, 2011.  In accordance with the requirements of FAR 5.207(c)(11), a written request for quotation and any documents related to this acquisition will be issued in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13, and will be available on the internet on or about 14 August 2009. The offeror is responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the request for quotation and amendments (if any).  A formal request for quotation is not available for release at this time. 
This requirement is being issued as a total small business set-aside opportunity.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335911 and the size standard is 500 employees. There is an incumbent contractor, however, this is a competitive requirement.  In accordance with FAR 19.102(f)(4), the Small Business Administration has determined that there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market, and has granted a class waiver in effect as of April 23, 2009 so that a nonmanufacturer does not have to furnish the product of a small business. 
Full funding for requirements to be completed by resultant contract award(s) may utilize funds provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the 'Act'), Public Law 111-5.  Inclusion of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency requirements by the successful offeror(s), will be required in any resultant contract.
All questions and concerns may be submitted to the Contract Specialist, James R. Hall, via email at jrhall@usgs.gov.(ATN: SV0002M)

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate and award, on a sole source basis, a stand-alone, cost plus fixed fee contract for nine months with Fluor Intercontinental, Inc., Greenville, South Carolina. This action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, 'Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.' This action is required to allow for continuity of operations and maintenance services for the Gulf Region Division (GRD) in Iraq for nine months. The current period of performance ends 21 August 2009. Award to any source other than Fluor Intercontinental, Inc would result in unacceptable delays and substantial cost that are considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition. This action will be awarded via a nine-month stand-alone contract with a period of performance of 22 September 2009 through 30 June 2010. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed towards Fluor Intercontinental, Inc. This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available. All responses should be directed to Betty Rogers at betty.a.rogers@usace.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from publication of this synopsis.

<a href="mailto:ryan.jorgensen@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>This Performance Work Statement (PWS) covers the requirements of the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command's (USAMRMCs) Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) for research consultation, support and analysis for a TATRC based AAMTI project to be conduct at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) entitled A pilot study of store and forward telepsychiatry in military settings<BR>2.  	Background/Purpose<BR><BR>As part of TATRCs AMEDD Advanced Medical Technology Initiative (AAMTI) a demonstration trial entitled A pilot study of store and forward telepsychiatry in military settings is occurring in partnership with WRAMC.  A significant percentage of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom service members have mental health care needs including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse increasing the burden of the Department of Defenses system of mental health care.   A new model of remote care, store and forward telepsychiatry, holds promise to address work load burden on the current psychiatric work force as well as improve the quality of available psychiatric care.   In store and forward telepsychiatry initial psychiatric assessments are conducted either by a nurse practitioner or social worker and recorded using a high quality digital video camera.  The interview is tagged for clinically relevant material by the clinician using a clicker when they deem clinically relevant material is being discussed so that a later psychiatrist reviewer can know where in the interview to select sections to observe.  A summary of the patients history along with the recorded video interview is forwarded electronically to a psychiatrist who then reviews the material and provides an assessment and psychiatric treatment plan.  This plan is transmitted to the patients primary care provider.   The primary provider then manages the patients psychiatric conditions using the psychiatric consultation as well as email and phone follow-up consultation with the psychiatrist.  <BR>This demonstration trial will test this new modality of care using a randomized controlled design with 120 patients seeking psychiatric care in the Walter Reed Medical Center Tele-Behavioral Health Service. Outcomes measures will include measures of clinical symptoms, systems of care measurements and comparison of diagnoses given during store and forward assessments.  If this system proves feasible and reliable in its adaptation to the Department of Defense it could have significant benefits in providing remote care and consultation, amplifying the current psychiatric work force, addressing work load issues and improving the quantity and quality of psychiatric consultation available throughout the system.<BR>   	In order to carry-out this project consultation services are needed to appropriately design and adapt store and forward telepsychiatry for WRAMC.  Additional services are required for evaluation of this trial from those with expertise in store and forward telepsychiatry for project evaluation, statistical analysis and consultation and manuscript/report production.<BR><BR>3.  	Objective<BR><BR>Vendor shall advise and aid in the design and adaptation of store and forward telepsychiatry for WRAMC for the demonstration pilot.  The vendor shall also help to refine the planned evaluation of the pilot including data collection methods and sources.   Once data has been collected the vendor shall work with the Primary Investigator (PI) for the project (Dr. Jay Shore) to aid in the sorting and cleaning of the data, conduct the primary statistical analysis and evaluation of the data and work to create reports including submission of manuscripts for publication on the outcomes of the trial. <BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W9115U-09-R-1010.<br><br>The U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command intends to award a sole source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Task Order contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to SRI International, Menlo Park, CA who will provide technical support for the APLS.  The support includes depot level repair and refurbishment of 100 personnel units, 23 pallet units, 15 pallet units configured with ARINC 429, 3 GPS re-radiators, 2 rapid data download/charger rack and analysis workstations, software maintenance, periodic maintenance, training and upgrades, support and troubleshooting during field operations, and other defined support that may be needed due to mission and software upgrades.  The estimated minimum dollar amount is $99,000.00 and the maximum amount ceiling is $498,500.00.  The period of performance is a base year with four options. The contract type is Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort.  The Government has previously purchased the requested services under purchase order W9115U-08-P-0046.  The Airborne Position Location System (APLS) was produced for the U.S. Army Operational Test Command, Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate (ABNSOTD) under contract DATM01-01-C-0006 by SRI, Menlo Park, CA.  SRI is also currently upgrading and producing APLS Paratrooper units through contract W9115U-08-C-0008.  Because of the technical complexity, uniqueness, and the need to rapidly modify the APLS system to meet unique and ever changing test requirements, ABNSOTD recognized the need for a sustainment contract. SRI was awarded the original sustainment contract on 7 September 2004. SRI is the only known source that has the expertise, technical resource, and the capability to operate the APLS sustainment program at the present time.  ABNSOTD conducted market research in an attempt to find viable and capable business concerns capable of handling the sustainment program due to their expertise in either Inertial Measurement Systems or Global Positioning Systems.   Upon investigation of their capabilities, the identified companies were deemed unsuitable for the tasks required.  In addition, the ATEC Mission Support Contracting Activity conducted a Sources Sought on 02/18/2009 and received no expression of interest.  The NAICS code is 811213 with size standard of $6.5M. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will only consider the proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be used only for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may identify interest and capability by responding to this requirement or submit a proposal. All respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and have a valid DUNS number, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number. All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to amsca.atec@us.army.mil. Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 at http://cbdnet.gpo.gov/num-note.html apply. The point of the contact for this announcement is Angelic Hatcher, Contract Specialist or Patricia M. Cuff, Contracting Officer. <BR><BR>    <BR><BR> <BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is seeking interested contractors to provide a second SBSS Block 10 satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. The follow-on acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in late 3rd qtr FY10 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. The Government intends to use the responses to this synopsis to determine whether or not a sole source contract will be appropriate.
<p>All responsible sources that believe they are capable of fulfilling a Prime Contractor role for an operational satellite system shall submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) which shall be considered by SYSW. The SOC should identify concepts that leverage existing heritage space programs, minimize non-recurring development efforts, with high technology readiness levels (TRL). The candidate concepts must have a solution capable of meeting SBSS Follow-On requirements and delivering on the aforementioned launch schedule. Prime contractor SOCs should include the following information: Company name, address, primary POC including phone number; brief technical summary of TRL 8 or greater concepts to meet this need; evidence of ability to meet demanding schedule; evidence of optical payload, spacecraft and ground development and integration expertise for space programs; knowledge of Air Force Space Command SSA; evidence of capability to support operation and maintenance pertaining to space systems, description of facilities and equipment available for use in support of this effort; ability to obtain use of facilities for processing.</p>
<p>In order to receive a copy of the Secret collateral Technical Requirements Document (TRD), potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 07 August 2009 to Catherine Detro at catherine.detro.ctr@losangeles.af.mil who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret TRD to an authorized facility.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the review of the SOC, potential Prime Contractors will be invited to Industry Day. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to four (4) attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, and IAW JAFAN 6/0 and 6/4 which meets Tier 1 Standards. If a person is not currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, then an updated SF-86 signed within the last year must accompany the SAP Format 1. If the person is currently briefed to a SAP sponsored by SYSW, then only the SAP Format 1 is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Discussions". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one (1) or two (2) page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.</p>
<p>Requests for requirements documents or other inquiries must be submitted to the following email addresses: jason.holman@losangeles.af.mil, jon.hobart@losangeles.af.mil, william.caldwell@losangeles.af.mil and ted.sheope@losangeles.af.mil. Responses to this synopsis must be received via email to the addresses above by 1 September 2009 in electronic format (MS Word 2000 or newer, or PDF) and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font. Submittals must not exceed 20 pages in length. Submissions should include the following format: Executive Summary, Concept Description, TRL Assessment, Compliance w/ TRD Requirements, Schedule, Experience with Optical Space Surveillance Systems, Facilities and Equipment, Security, Logistics and Sustainment, and Summary. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with the points of contact listed above. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel. Response from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill, USAF AFSPC SMC/PK at (310) 653-1789.</p>

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbents actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to obtain data collection services. 

Background

In Fiscal Year 2001, the Center hired contractor to collect foreign aquaculture drug use information, develop a database to house the information and conduct food safety risk assessments using the available data.  The purpose of the contract was so FDA could gain the knowledge needed to ensure the safety of imported aquaculture seafood products.  Information was collected on the drugs and chemicals used worldwide.  We gave the contractor a list of countries which we knew imported the most seafood products into the United States.  The contractor was asked to gather data on the types, amounts, and use patterns of drugs and chemicals in aquaculture and provide the methods available to measure residues of the drugs and chemicals or their metabolites.  The contractor was also asked to gather available human food safety data including, but not limited to, toxicity, metabolism, and pharmacokinetics about the drugs and chemicals.  All of this information was entered into a database, AQRIS.  

Following the development of the database, the data was analyzed within a risk assessment framework to prioritize FDA concerns for exposures of U.S. consumers to unsafe residues in the edible tissue of imported aquaculture products.   The contractor created a Risk Assessment Tool, AQRRT, using Microsoft Access, so that the Agency could look at the data in different ways to determine the risk of a compound.  This tool provided flexibility when reviewing the data and the risk ranking of the individual data components.  

Initial project was completed in 2006 but the data was reviewed and obtained for 2001-2002 only.  Since the data used for this project is now over seven years old it needs to be updated.  The database needs to include new species that are being cultured in foreign countries such as bass, catfish, tilapia, and any other fish species that may be identified as being cultured, the drugs and chemicals used in the production of these species, and all the other data points that were reviewed for the original contract of foreign drug use information.

Scope of Work/Deliverables include:

The contractor shall provide the following: 
For each species listed in the database, the contractor shall provide, at a minimum, information on the types of drugs (including transgenics), chemicals, and conditions of use in each country as follows:

o	drug or chemical name/tradename 
o	chemical structure of drug/chemical
o	CAS (Chemical Abstract Society) number
o	dosage form(s)
o	dosages, frequency, duration of treatment
o	conditions/indications for use for each species; including lifestages 
o	any special conditions of use 
o	withdrawal times [if any] 
o	use of drug according to country's guidelines (state if drug/chemical is approved or not)
o	copy of label(s) 
o	extent of use of drug or chemical 

Any additional data collected that would be helpful for the evaluation and risk assessment of foreign drug use in aquaculture should also be included.

Contractors shall satisfy the following requirements.  Provide a detailed description of your companys (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one (address each separately) of the following requirements:

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses).  The NAICS Code is 541511.  The small business size standard is 25M. The U.S Food and Drug Administration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) worked in collaboration with Lincoln Technologies to develop a software tool called the Web Submissions Data Manager (WebSDM).  It was designed to provide a user-friendly environment for browsing and reviewing CDISC-compliant clinical trial data. WebSDM functionality includes the capability to: Load and validate data submitted in CDISC SDTM-formatted clinical trials data, including error-checking against SDTM specifications and the implementation guide. Checking includes structural and consistency errors; Integrate and analyze clinical trial data, including the pooling of data across studies; Browse data in a variety of tabular and graphical display formats; Drill down to individual subject data supported with graphical patient profiles using the integrated Data Montage graphs or with built-in links to PPD Patient Profiles. In addition, WebSDM is fully integrated with Lincolns Clinical Trial Signal Detection (CTSD) system, which comprises a set of graphical and analytical tools designed to help reviewers to access safety data during the product review.  CTSD integrates data from the WebSDM SDTM staging area and performs automated screening for safety issues.  CTSD features a graphical Sector Map that provides a big picture overview that highlights adverse event terms with higher than expected counts.  Terms are grouped according to the MedDRA hierarchy to support pattern recognition.  For patients treated with a study drug, terms that appear disproportionately more appear in red; terms more frequent in the comparator or placebo appear in green. FDAs is interested in techniques/tools that are capable of integrating the data with a comprehensive set of centrally programmed, automated analytical tools that facilitate the validation, management, integration, and analysis of clinical trials data in SDTM-compliant format, and the follow-up auditing of the analyses generated to perform a drug safety review.  These tools need to include analytical modules capable of generating adjusted and stable safety signals that are corrected for multiplicity and for small counts.  The integrated capability to interactively analyze safety signals in a graphical illustration of the data and the capability of moving quickly from the big picture to the fine details within individual patients adds a valuable input to the overall process of drug safety evaluation and auditing needed during the regulatory review process.  These adjusted and stable safety signals need to be carefully investigated to determine whether information needs to be added to the drug label or if risk mitigation programs are required before a product can be approved. Through its involvement in CRADA to develop this SDTM data management tool, FDA has helped create and test an integrated software tool that is well-suited to the import, validation, and review of clinical study data from new drug and therapeutic biologic product submissions.  To achieve the benefits of this tool in the review of standardized clinical trials data, it is necessary to take the next steps with a comprehensive roll-out plan and associated technical support.  The objectives of this project are to obtain services for the operation and maintenance of the WebSDM software and to expand use of the WebSDM software throughout FDA.   Specific objectives of this requirement are listed below: Project management to maintain and expand the use and functionality of the WebSDM data management software; Application support, including Oracle database maintenance, software upgrades and development support for new and advanced analytical features (such as the ones needed to automatically handle the different study designs in Clinical Trials, and to automatically handle new data domains in SDTM CDISC), and support for advanced and less advanced users; Software change management; Provide periodic on-site and remote training; this training shall include documentation of the statistical methodologies used in the tool for clinical trials safety analysis; Assist with production roll-out of WebSDM. It is anticipated that travel may be required to attend conferences and symposiums to provide interface and attain knowledge necessary for the performance of the requirements. Interested small business offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Response must directly demonstrate the companys capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform the requirement as described above in sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 (Limitations of  Subcontracting).  Failure to definitively address each aspect of the requirement will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work. Responses to this notice shall be limited to ten pages, and must include:

1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.

Introduction
This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541712 should not submit a response to this notice.

Background
The NHLBI is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) capable of conducting all aspects (administrative guidance, oversight, and support) of a multi-center Randomized Evaluation of VAD InterVEntion before Inotropic Therapy (REVIVE-IT) feasibility clinical study. 

Purpose and Objective
The purpose of this clinical feasibility study is to explore the potential benefit of mechanical circulatory support therapy using ventricular assist devices (VADs) in functionally-impaired advanced heart failure patients who have not yet developed serious consequences from their disease.  The study will serve to inform a pivotal trial directed at a large and growing patient population for whom VADs could offer substantial benefit beyond current medical therapies.  

Project Requirements
The clinical study to be developed will test the hypothesis that VAD therapy improves both survival and quality of life in those advanced heart failure patients who are neither inotrope-dependent nor exercise-intolerant and have not yet developed serious consequences such as malnourishment, end-organ damage, and immobility.  The recommendations made by the NHLBI Working Group on the Clinical Use of VADs are given below.  

 Study hypothesis: VAD therapy in the proposed patient population will improve functional 
  status at 12 months post-randomization and all cause mortality will be no worse than that in 
  the optimal medical management arm of the study. 

 Patients for the study should be ill enough to potentially experience both functional and
  survival benefits from the therapy without undue risk. 

 The estimated mortality rate for this group should be 20%- 30% at one year. 

 Patient Population Inclusion Criteria includes (1) hospitalization in past 6 months, (2) NYHA
  Class IV or Advanced Class III, (3) maximal evidence-based therapies for 3 months, (4) 
  duration of heart failure of at least a year, and (5) no inotropic support for 30 days prior to 
  enrollment.

 The study should be randomized between VAD and optimal medical management (OMM)
  arms.

 The primary endpoint should be a composite of survival and functional status where the
   improvement in functional status would need to be substantial and assessed through 
   objective metrics.

 Secondary endpoints are safety, secondary functional and physiologic markers, quality of
   life, neurocognition, and cost and cost effectiveness.

 Patients should be followed for at least two years.

 Substantial evidence of acceptable clinical performance is required for VADs to be used in
   the study. 

The DCC is expected to develop the clinical study plan (including specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and rationale, device(s) for the VAD therapy arm of the clinical study, adverse event definitions, and functional, quality of life, and neurocognitive measures), a draft protocol, negotiate and obtain signed contracts/agreements with clinical sites and industry partners. 

Required activities by the DCC include, but are not limited to, (1) finalizing all details of the clinical study to provide evidence for the proposed hypothesis and to assess recruitment and data quality; (2) finalizing the clinical protocol and protocol-related documents (e.g. informed consent form, case report forms, etc.); (3) implementation and conduct of the clinical study in accordance with all Federal requirements; (4) management and oversight of the conduct of the clinical study; (5) providing clinical research support services; (6) providing monitoring and safety oversight; (7) providing site training and support; (8) organizing investigator and DSMB meetings and teleconferences; (9) recruiting and randomizing patients; (10) organizing, conducting, and reimbursing for patient protocol evaluations and tests (including follow-up); and (11) analyzing the data and authoring and submitting papers on the study for publication. 

Anticipated Period of Performance
The solicitation release date is pending.  The Government intends to negotiate one (1) cost-reimbursement contract for a period of five years with an approximate award date of September 1, 2010.  

Capability Statement
Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contract  Specialist.  The capabilities statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts, and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of previous research projects in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program. The capability statement must not exceed 10 single sided or 5 double sided pages in length and using a 12-point font size minimum.

<p>SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
<p>The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified), to perform the following Statement of Work/Specifications.</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATION</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (Title III of Pub.L. 98-623, 16 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) Provides the legislative authority necessary to implement, with respect to the United States, the Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program. The AMLR Program, which is managed by the Antarctic Ecosystem Research Group (AERG) at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), provides information to the U.S. delegation to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), part of the Antarctic treaty system.</p>
<p>CCAMLR is an international treaty between 23 nations that seeks to manage Antarctic fisheries with the goal of preserving species diversity and stability of the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. In keeping with this objective, CCAMLR has designated areas of research that member nations are obligated to pursue. The AMLR Program has identified specific data sets that must be collected to respond to CCAMLR's research directives. In doing so, the AMLR Program supports the U.S. Government's commitment to CCAMLR.</p>
<p>In 1996/97, the AMLR Program, in cooperation with the NSF, began providing logistical support for the NSF field camp at Admiralty Bay, King George Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Within the vicinity of this study area, the AMLR program has a large-area survey grid. The NSF field camp and study area are adjacent to an area where reproductive success and feeding ecology of breeding penguins have been monitored since 1976. Dr Wayne Trivelpiece has directed the predator studies at this NSF site since its inception in 1976, together with Susan G. Trivelpiece, Co-PI. In October 1997, Dr Trivelpiece accepted a full time position with the NMFS in La Jolla, CA and the NSF transferred funding for the continuation of this study to the SWFSC.<br /><br />II. PURPOSE<br /><br />A. Overall Program Objectives</p>
<p>The NSF/AMLR cooperative program monitors a suite of predators, primarily penguins at the Copacabana field site and formulates management advice to CCAMLR. In addition, the Program conducts field research designed to describe the functional relationships between krill (Euphausia superba), their predators, and key environmental variables.</p>
<p>B. Specific Study Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of the research covered by this contract include the following:</p>
<p>(1) to participate in the data analysis and preparation of papers for scientific journals as assisted by the seabird biologist.</p>
<p>III. CONTRACT TASKS</p>
<p>A. Tasks</p>
<p>1. Data Analysis and Writing: The Contractor will analyze data and prepare papers ready for submission on penguin diets, and on penguin-krill interactions in the near-shore environment at Cape Shirreff, Antarctica.</p>
<p>B. GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED AND CONTRACTOR-PROVIDED PROPERTY</p>
<p>The Government will provide data and scientific equipment as needed to complete the specific tasks above.</p>
<p><br />IV. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:</p>
<p>The Contractor will complete and submit drafts of these papers, ready for submission to journals TBA.</p>
<p>V. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The Contractor will be assessed on technical skill, ability to complete the deliverables within the time frame of the contract, demonstrated ability to do the work, and price. More importance will be placed on technical skill and demonstrated ability than price when evaluating different contractors.</p>

<p><br />The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is collaborating with La Coordinacion de Investigacion y Conservacion de Mamiferos Marinos, Instituto Nacional de Ecologia (INE). The Vaquita Expedition 2008 collected acoustic recordings of the porpoise in order to develop the ability to monitor trends in abundance for vaquita using autonomous acoustic monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>Current acoustic and visual methods lack sufficient precision to monitor trends in the now very low abundance. Autonomous acoustic devices should increase precision because they can record for long periods of time, however, such devices have yet to be developed and characterized. To characterize the abilities of such devices to detect vaquita the initial research will require visual validation of porpoise densities that can best be attained with a large ship equipped with high power binoculars. There is also the question of how many devices are needed and where they should be placed that will require a better description of current vaquita distribution than now exists.</p>
<p>II. PURPOSE&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of the Vaquita Expedition 2008 was to develop a method to monitor trends in abundance using autonomous passive acoustics. Data gathered from the Vaquita Express, a 24' sailing vessel needs to be analyzed in order to create a detection function. The detection function will be used to determine the feasibility of using a sailing vessel to monitor vaquita acoustically. The specific objective of the research covered by this contract includes the following:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;To perform acoustic validation of porpoise densities attained using IFAW Rainbow Click software and other acoustic devices towed from the Vaquita Express, a sailing vessel. The data will be used to describe the vaquita demographic structure in the upper Gulf of California area during the Vaquita Expedition 2008 research cruise.</p>
<p>a. Reprocess recordings: Reprocess Vaquita 2008 high frequency (HF) recordings made in the field using a set of standard detection parameters for consistency. HF recordings need to be reprocessed using the vaquita detection software in a controlled office environment on a PC with greater processing power.</p>
<p>b. Noise analyses: Noise impairs the detection process and must be factored into calculations of relative and absolute abundance. For the analysis of the Vaquita 2008 data; the following need to be calculated: (i) the detection algorithm threshold level; (ii) trigger band noise levels and; (iii) 1/3rd octave noise levels for a random subset of files. The spatial and temporal distribution of the detection algorithm threshold level needs to be modeled and described to determine areas where detection thresholds may need to be adjusted during future surveys.</p>
<p>c. Reprocess click data: Click files generated from recordings made in the field need to be reprocessed using improved species classifiers and bearing and amplitude calculations.</p>
<p>d. Review reprocessed click files for detections: Reprocessed click files will then need to be reviewed for vaquita click trains to allow a final number of vaquita detections to be calculated. HF recordings associated with vaquita detections will need to be reprocessed using a series of increasing trigger thresholds to determine the impact of using different trigger levels on detection rates.</p>
<p>e. Prepare data for analysis: Data will be prepared in a format determined by the Vaquita Acoustics Team: transects need to be split into 0.1km effort segments and covariates will be assigned to each segment.</p>
<p>2) Training of staff from NOAA and CICESE in the analysis and reprocessing of high frequency click data using vaquita detection software. Training will take place at NOAA Fisheries, 3333 N. Torrey Pines Court, La Jolla, CA or CICESE, Km. 107 Carretera Ensenada-Tijuana, Ensenada, BC 22860 (actual location to be determined by 15 September 2009).</p>
<p>a. Introduction to the fundamentals and post processing using vaquita detection software: This training session would be open to a maximum of eight (8) persons with a basic knowledge of cetacean vocal behavior and how acoustic data is collected in the field; all must be computer literate. The teaching will allow participants access to the software and field data files to become familiar with them. Attendees will need to have access to a computer.</p>
<p>b. Advanced analysis of data in using vaquita detection software, Access, and MatLab: This course would be restricted to a maximum group size of 4. Those attending this module would then be able to train others, and could expect support by phone and email after finishing the course. This course will focus on analyzing data using a combination of software.</p>
<p>3) Deliverables: The Contractor will analyze recordings of vaquita made in the upper Gulf of California and produce a Summary Report of Vaquita Recordings and Analysis: The summary of the analysis will be produced in a white paper format for evaluation at the Vaquita Workshop in Ensenada, Mexico in October 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) Government-Provided and Contractor-Provided Property: The Contractor will provide the acoustic equipment, computer systems and all other equipment and supplies required for the contracted tasks above.</p>
<p>5) Reporting Requirements and Deliverables: The Contractor shall be required to complete and submit a summary report. The format of the report shall be white paper to allow for review.</p>
<p>6) Budget: The Government does not provide insurance to the Contractor and, under most circumstances, is not liable for injuries suffered by the Contractor during the performance of duties.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for travel. Travel shall include all costs associated with getting the Contractor from his/her home&nbsp;to San Diego, CA and return, including airfare, ground transportation, lodging, food, and miscellaneous expenses associated with this travel.</p>
<p>III. EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The Contractor will be assessed on technical skill, ability to complete the deliverables within the time frame of the contract, knowledge of relevant datasets, demonstrated ability to do the work, and price. More importance will be placed on technical skill and demonstrated ability than price when evaluating different contractors.</p>

In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control. <br />(c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered "issued" when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.</p>

The quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract. <br />(b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity designated in the Schedule as the "maximum." The Government shall order at least the quantity of supplies or services designated in the Schedule as the "minimum." <br />(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations. <br />(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after 12 months from contract award or option exercised.</p>

<p><br />52.216-2 Economic Price Adjustment-Standard Supplies. <br />As prescribed in 16.203-4(a), insert the following clause. The clause may be modified by increasing the 10 percent limit on aggregate increases specified in paragraph (c)(1), upon approval by the chief of the contracting office. <br />(a) The Contractor warrants that the unit price stated in the Schedule for (___________ ) [offeror insert Schedule line item number] is not in excess of the Contractor's applicable established price in effect on the contract date for like quantities of the same item. The term "unit price" excludes any part of the price directly resulting from requirements for preservation, packaging, or packing beyond standard commercial practice. The term "established price" means a price that- <br />(1) Is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public; and <br />(2) Is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. <br />(b) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the amount and effective date of each decrease in any applicable established price. Each corresponding contract unit price shall be decreased by the same percentage that the established price is decreased. The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor's established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly. <br />(c) If the Contractor's applicable established price is increased after the contract date, the corresponding contract unit price shall be increased, upon the Contractor's written request to the Contracting Officer, by the same percentage that the established price is increased, and the contract shall be modified accordingly, subject to the following limitations: <br />(1) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this clause shall not exceed 10 percent of the original contract unit price. <br />(2) The increased contract unit price shall be effective- <br />(i) On the effective date of the increase in the applicable established price if the Contracting Officer receives the Contractor's written request within 10 days thereafter; or <br />(ii) If the written request is received later, on the date the Contracting Officer receives the request. <br />(3) The increased contract unit price shall not apply to quantities scheduled under the contract for delivery before the effective date of the increased contract unit price, unless failure to deliver before that date results from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor, within the meaning of the Default clause. <br />(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price. <br />(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase. <br />(d) During the time allowed for the cancellation provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this clause, and thereafter if there is no cancellation, the Contractor shall continue deliveries according to the contract delivery schedule, and the Government shall pay for such deliveries at the contract unit price, increased to the extent provided by paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>
<p><br />52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. <br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 (years).</p>

<DESC><p>Insensitive Munition (IM), 105mm Cartridge for the PGU44/B-E1 on the AC 130 Gunship<br />The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Mac Dill AFB, Tampa Florida, is conducting a market survey for a manufacturer of a PGU44/B-E1, Insensitive Munitions (IM) cartridges for the AC 130 gunship. The PGU44/B-E1 is an improved version of the presently used PGU44/B in that the HE Comp B is being replaced by PBXN-109, an explosive with IM qualities. Venting holes are also being placed at the base of the cartridge case so that venting of the M67 propellant can take place during the IM thermal threats, i.e., Slow Cook Off and Fast Cook Off.<br />For use on the AC 130 aircraft, the projectile and the brass cartridge case, is crimped to the projectile so that the two travel together as one in the PA 71 container prior to installation onto the aircraft. <br />The manufacturer must have experience in filling M1 projectiles with IM Insensitive explosives. It must understand ullage space needed to accommodate expansion during temperature cycling. It must be familiar with means to line the interior walls of the projectile for adhesion of the explosive.<br />During this phase of the program, USSOCOM is interested in purchasing four hundred (400) cartridge cases fully assembled in a PA 71 container. No fuzes are required for these rounds. These rounds will be used to conduct a qualification of the round on a ground gun to insure that all safety requirements are met. The PGU44/B-E1 will later replace the standard PGU44/B in production.<br />All respondents must be able to demonstrate past performance as well as the capability to provide system engineering integration, manufacture vented cartridge cases, and experience to fill projectiles with insensitive explosives. Competence in these areas shall be demonstrated through written description of the vendors past and/or current experience of manufacturing similar systems. <br />Interested sources should submit their information no later than 14 August 2009 to the contracting officer, Ms. Verdetta Weaver at weaverv@socom.mil. Submittals should include the contractor's name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, and size of business. All submissions must be in electronic format. Questions of a technical nature should be submitted to Mr. William Andrews at william.andrews@socom.mil.
<p>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the result of this survey.</p>

<DESC><p>ULTRA PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. The solicitation number is FA8601-09-T-0068. The NAICS Code is 334516. The size standard is 500 employees. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). The proposed source is Waters Corporation. The purchase is for an Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) System. The requirement is only met with an ultra high pressure system inherent in UPLC instruments. Because of the highly complex test samples to be used, we have special requrements for sensitivity, resolutions, and speed. Additionally, the laboratory requires that the manufacturer provide prompt technical support with resppect to maintenance and applications. Because of its proprietary column and design, the Waters UPLC is able to achieve higher pressures than typical systems. As such, Waters UPLC system is the only known system that can meet requrements for sensitivity, resolutions, and speed with limited samples, and since they are the leader in UPLC systems, they are able to provide the best technical support including local academic resources for applications support. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, any quotation received within ten (10) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotations should be e-mailed to Shelley.Deardorff@wpafb.af.mil or faxed to Shelley Deardorff, 88 CONS/PKBB, 937-257-3926 no later than 10 August 2009. Only proposals received by this date will be considered. Any questions should be directed to Shelley Deardorff at 937-522-4525.</p>

<DESC><p>Small Business Size Standard - 1,000 employees</p>
<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing intends to award a Supplemental Agreement modification under Contract Number F04701-96-C-0025 to The Boeing Company incorporating the Estimated Labor Hours, and the estimated rates per hour (not to exceed a total price $550,000.00), for CY09 in Special Contract Requirements (SCR) H.4 and cost-plus fixed-fee CLIN 1600.</p>
<p>The purpose of these studies will be to conduct feasibility assessment and analysis to determine the validity, necessity, adequacy, impact, potential implementation, and cost of all proposed changes in requirements for the GPS system (including user equipment), and proposed changes to other GPS dependent systems (including military, civil, commercial, and international applications). Also, provide engineering and management support to prepare studies of solutions to operational, logistical, administrative, business, and technical problems (e.g. reducing operator workload through increased reliance on on-orbit autonomy).</p>
<p>The Government is on contract with Boeing to develop and produce GPS IIF satellites and to upgrade the existing GPS Operational Control Segment. The Government believes Boeing is uniquely qualified to provide these studies, as it will require systems and data that are proprietary to Boeing. Furthermore, the Government does not have exclusive rights to this data. These Studies will require extensive knowledge of Boeing's unique, proprietary design solution to the GPS IIF spacecraft. Additionally, these studies will include research of methods to maximize technical capability or extend the useable life of the GPS IIF satellite. Due to the aforementioned reasons, no other contractor would be able to adequately produce the Studies, which can only be accomplished with Boeing proprietary systems and data. As such, Boeing is considered the only responsible source that can perform the above stated Studies without the Government incurring substantial risk and duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).</p>
<p>All responsible sources, to include Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses, may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) which will be considered. Oral communication is not acceptable. The SOC must include the following information: 1) company name, mailing address, points of contract and telephone numbers; 2) business size classification (large, small, or other); 3) experience in GPS satellites or similar technologies; 4) ability to satisfy the government's performance as described above. Proprietary information must be expressly identified in the SOC. Only U.S. owned companies' resident within the continental United States or its territories will be considered.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in MS Word 2000 or newer format or PDF format to darin.huler@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to GPSW/PK, Attn: Darin Huler, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. All responses are due no later than 15 August 2009 and must conform to 8.5 x 11-inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point, with a maximum of 20 pages. Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. Submission of the firm's SOC will be for information purposes only. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information nor shall any costs be allowed on any Government contract.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentially as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill at (310) 653-1789.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division (ISD) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the University of Michigan, 2901 Baxter Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2150. By contractual agreement, The University of Michigan shall determine the relative technical and regulatory costs to develop and produce vaccines by utilizing economic analysis and data mining methods. The University of Michigan will submit a study design and a plan for completion of this project. Throughout the study, University of Michigan researchers will submit reports describing the data collected, interview progress, and preliminary analytic results. At the completion of data collection, the contractor will conduct a final economic analysis and submit a report detailing the analysis, and prepare a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. For further details, see the attached statement of work. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 6.302-1. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to match existing services of on-going studies being conducted by the CDC. Regents of the University of Michigan, is believed to be the only source available that possesses the intellectual property rights to proprietary information of the vaccine pricing model developed for the CDC through a cooperative agreement, reference: FOA #IP06_010, Industrial Costs of Commercializing and Vaccines, and CFR 45 74.36. Further, University of Michigan researchers have made unique use of the Pharmaprojects database to develop a vaccine production pricing model that is both unique and rare to the vaccine manufacturing industry. Failure to acquire services from the University of Michigan, will preclude the use of such proprietary information, thus will result in significant project delays, skewed results from the pricing model, and ultimately create a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Firms that believe they can provide the services, as listed in the attached Statement of Work, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)<br />Immunization Services Division (ISD)</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: 2009-N-11508</p>
<p><br />Project Title: Economics of Vaccines - Tracking Vaccines under Development to Determine Cost Drivers of the Vaccine Development and Approval Process</p>
<p>C.1 Background</p>
<p>This special studies requirement will address several objectives of the U.S. National Vaccine Plan: 1) encourage the development of new and improved vaccines; 2) ensure the stable supply of vaccines; and 3) conduct research into the economics of vaccines [http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/vacc_plan/vacc_planp25.pdf ].</p>
<p>Several times between 2000 and 2004, there were shortages of vaccines medically recommended for both children and adults in the US [Coleman, NVAC]. One of the concerns that arose out of the various stakeholder discussions regarding the reasons for the shortages was the increasing business-related costs of complying with FDA regulations in the development and production of vaccines [Coleman, IOM]. While it is true that regulatory costs of doing business have increased, there is also a potential argument to be made that the technical costs of developing and producing vaccines have also increased. Many of the vaccines that have been developed in recent years use expensive new technologies and adjuvant (to improve immune response). There is no research that separates development and production costs into regulatory and technical components. This research proposal will identify what portion of costs may be attributable to regulatory requirements, and what are attributable to technical requirements.</p>
<p><br />Since 2006, the University of Michigan has been funded by the CDC Immunization Services Division to develop a proprietary pricing model for new vaccines that is now the intellectual property of the University of Michigan, with rights of use granted to the CDC. With appropriated grants funding, the University of Michigan purchased the use of a proprietary database called Pharmaprojects. This database tracks the movement of vaccine products from their inception through licensure, through all clinical trial phases. University researchers have gained a significant amount of expertise at data mining in Pharmaprojects, a skill which took quite a bit of time as the data collection systems of Pharmaprojects are idiosyncratic The uniqueness of the University of Michigan use of the Pharmacoprojects database was to mine data for microeconomic analysis of specific vaccine and biologics products that have not been previously analyzed either in business or university research. In addition, researchers at the University of Michigan have developed other project-specific skills: extracting clinical trials data from FDA websites; interpreting FDA vaccine-specific data available from the agency; and building relationships with business and technical personnel working in vaccine-originating businesses or vaccine policy arenas (e.g., pharmaceutical consultants, biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical firms, and policy makers). In addition to becoming expert at extracting original data for microeconomic analysis of vaccines and biologics, the University of Michigan researchers have developed intellectual property in the form of a unique pricing model that incorporates: the time it takes vaccine products to work through all phases of development and post-licensure production; risk of vaccine product failures; and pricing options. This model provides a clear picture of the overall net return to businesses that invest in vaccine development and sales.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this CDC project will take advantage of the intellectual property and project-specific data collection and analytic skills and professional contacts of researchers at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p><br />C.2. Purpose<br /><br />1) Understand how the regulatory process affects the decision to engage in the development of new vaccines; and</p>
<p>2) Understand which costs are necessitated by the technical process of vaccine development and which costs are necessitated by the government regulatory process.<br /><br />The CDC requires this information because :<br />1. Understanding the interaction of regulation and the decision to produce vaccines will allow the government to create policies that retain current vaccine manufacturers in the business and attract potential new entrants to the market<br />2. Understanding the division of costs between regulation and technical processes will allow government to:<br />a. Streamline regulatory processes if they are found to be unnecessarily burdensome<br />b. Determine potential financial incentives to vaccine developers that might reduce prices of new vaccines which, in turn, would decrease vaccine program purchase costs<br />c. Hold data-informed discussions in venues where the U.S. Government is chastised for driving up research, development and manufacturing costs through unnecessary regulations.</p>
<p>C.3 Objectives</p>
<p>Specific objectives are to:<br />1. Update existing, proprietary pricing model that is the intellectual property of the Regents of the University of Michigan developed at the behest of CDC through a cooperative agreement with the Regents of the University of Michigan.<br />2. Follow a cohort of ~150 to 200 new vaccine products in Pharmaprojects, a proprietary database that tracks the time needed for new vaccine products to progress from inception to licensure,<br />3. Interview the vaccine originators of each product, using the contacts developed by Dr. Davis and his group at the University of Michigan, and, where there is more than one originator (e.g., where a manufacturer buys the rights to a product developed by a biotechnology firm), then interview all involved,<br />4. Track time and regulatory activity through requests to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and through web sites run by the FDA, and<br />5. Model and analyze the data to apportion costs between regulatory and technical requirements.</p>
<p>Through the use of quality health economic analysis and prevention effectiveness research, these data will be used to support the implementation of effective and sustainable immunization policies that ensure the supply of current and potential future vaccines.</p>

<p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<br />National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)<br />1600 Clifton Road, Mailstop E-52<br />Atlanta, GA 30333</p>
<p>C.5 Scope</p>
<p>The contractor will submit a study design and a plan for completion of the work.

<p>C.6 Place of Performance</p>
<p>All work, to exclude breifings or presentation of findings, will take place at the Contractors place of business. Briefings will take place at the Requesting Agency (See C.4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.7 Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 24 months from the date of award. The project will be funded in two (2) 12 month increments, to include one base year and one option year. Determination to continue the second 12 month increment (exercise the option year) will be made prior to the end of the intial 12-month period, and is dependent on contractor performance within the base period.</p>
<p><br />C.8 Continuity of Services.</p>
<p>The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are considered vital to the U.S. Government and must be continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the U.S. Government or another contractor, may continue these services. The contractor agrees to (1) furnish phase-in knowledge transfer and (2) exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.</p>
<p>C.9 Technical Services Required:</p>
<p>Use economic analysis and data mining methods to estimate the relative technical and regulatory costs to develop and produce vaccines, and report results of findings.</p>
<p>C.10 Tasks:</p>
<p>The contractor shall:</p>
<p>Task 1 Study design development</p>
<p>Within two weeks of award, the Contractor's Principal Investigator and Project Manager will, in person or by teleconference, confer with and receive advice from CDC Project Staff. Items to be discussed will include, but not be limited to, numbers of products to be followed in the cohort of vaccines, data mining methods, time table for key informant interviews, collection of secondary data from FDA and FDA websites, refinement of pricing model, and potential estimation techniques. After this meeting the contractor will incorporate the advice of the CDC Project Staff into a study work plan. This task is to receive 5% of total project effort.</p>
<p>Task 2 Submission of work plan</p>
<p>Within three weeks of receipt of the statement of work, the Contractor shall forward to the Project Officer the project work plan. The work plan shall include the Contractor's proposed methods to perform task order requirements within the stated time frames, management and staffing plan, and a budget reflecting estimated costs to accomplish the requirements. This task is to receive 5% of total project effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task 3 Develop vaccine cohort and report initial results</p>
<p>Within three months of award of the task order, the Contractor will identify and collect information on ~150-200 unique vaccine products (actual number to be determined in discussion). The data mining results will be compiled, including identification of all of the vaccine originators, and a report submitted. This report will be distributed to CDC Project Staff for review at a meeting convened by the Contractor either in Atlanta or by teleconference. At this meeting the views of the CDC Project Staff will be obtained on how to proceed with interviewing key personnel at each vaccine originator and identifying all of the costs, regulatory and technical, associated with each product. It is anticipated that there will be fewer vaccine originators than unique products on the assumption that the same originators will have multiple products in development. At this time, the number of originators to be interviewed will be decided in discussion between CDC Project Staff and the Contractor Research Staff. This task is to receive 15% of total project effort.</p>
<p><br />Task 4 Interview of vaccine originators and collection of secondary data</p>
<p>During the following 12 months, the Contractor shall interview the vaccine originators agreed upon to collect cost information. In addition, secondary data collection shall proceed for the vaccine product cohort. Secondary data collection shall include, but not be limited to, FOIA requests to the FDA and use of FDA-sponsored web sites. It is understood that some of the collection of secondary data may take longer than 12 months because much of this data collection is subject to the response times of the FDA, which are out of the Contractor's control. At the end of the 12 month period, the Contractor shall host a second meeting (by teleconference, in Atlanta, or at the University of Michigan) and distribute a report of the initial findings synthesizing original Pharmaprojects data, secondary data, and key informant interviews. Discussion between the Contractor and CDC Project Staff will occur regarding the final task of the project. This task is to receive 55% of the total project effort.</p>
<p><br />Task 5 Final economic analysis report submission</p>
<p>Within 18 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will conduct economic analyses using the final data set and submit a report outlining the methods, assumptions, and final results. The economic analysis will include an update of the original pricing model, and specific analysis of 3 to 5 unique products. This report will be distributed to CDC Project Staff for review at a meeting convened by the Contractor in Atlanta or by teleconference. At this meeting the views of the CDC Project Staff will be obtained on the report regarding methods, assumptions, final results and suggestions for publication venue. This task is to receive 15% of total project effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task 6 Manuscript for publication</p>
<p>Within 18 months of award of the task order the Contractor will deliver a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The final version will be sent by the Contractor to the CDC Project Officer for CDC clearance and submission to a peer-reviewed journal for publication pending CDC clearance. This task is to receive 10% total effort.</p>

Title:  Loran-C Mark II Microsondes
NAICS Code:  334519
Product Code:Loran-C Mark II Radiosondes (Sippican Part Number 1543-611) Qty: 1,000
Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Product shall be delivered to:U.S. DEPT. OF COMMERCE/NOAA/CASC   NAT'L LOGISTICS SUPPORT CNTR (NLSC)/CCX2 1510 BANNISTER ROAD   KANSAS CITY MO 64131
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  
Description:  The Government has a requirement for radiosondes for its upper air monitoring stations.  Currently, 2 of the 102 operational upper air stations are Loran-C systems used to ascertain the wind measurements.  These sites operate at the 403 MHz radio frequency.  They are located in Albany, New York, and Wallops Island, Virginia.  In order to continue service, NOAA requires additional stock of the above items to monitor atmospheric profiles.  The ground system in place at each of the two Loran-C sites is a W-9000 Meteorological Processing System manufactured by VIZ Manufacturing Company (VIZ).  The meteorological products portion of VIZ since has been acquired by Sippican, Inc., which now has been acquired by Lockheed Martin Corporation.  The company presently is referred to as Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc. (Sippican).  Lockheed Martin Sippican, Inc.is the sole manufacturer of the Mark II Loran-C Microsonde, which is the only Loran-C radiosonde known to be compatible with the W-9000 Meteorological Processing Systems in place at the two Loran-C upper air sites.  As the Government has no rights to the design of these radiosondes, it cannot fully specify the design to another manufacturer.  Any attempt to duplicate the design would be cost-prohibitive and infringe on the rights of the current owner.  Due to the unique physical characteristics and physical form of the assembly, there are no acceptable alternatives to the Mark II Microsondes.  
The period of performance for this effort is for 5 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by Thursday, August 13, 2009.   Communications may be directed to the CO, Ms. Tamia A. True at tamia.true@aqd.nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; THIS ACTION IS BEING PLACED AGAINST AN EXISTING EPA CONTRACT</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">. <br /></span></strong>The purpose of this Modification 34 is to obligate $250,000 in initial funding in support of Work Assignment (WA 2-200). The period of performance for this work assignment will be from July 27, 2009 though February 10, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 2-200 of Contract EP-C-05-046 will have the contractor support EPA in providing technical and engineering support to the state of West Virginia's Department of Health and Human Services in order to expedite State processing and review of infrastructure projects so that the projects meet ARRA requirements of being under contract or having construction initiated on or before February 17, 2010. Specific sites are not known, but rather the sites will be across the state of West Virginia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire services.  Response to this RFI will be treated as information only.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  The information provided may be used by the Social Security Administration in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work.  

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to exchange information with industry related to its efforts to acquire Information Technology Support services.  Contractor support is required to assist the Agency with the implementation of the Agency Strategic Plan (ASP) and IT Vision needed to maintain a strong level of performance on core workloads and works toward long term improvement of the services the Agency provides to the public by concentrating on eliminating its hearings backlogs and preventing its recurrence; improving the speed and quality of SSAs disability process; improving SSAs retiree and other core services; and preserving the publics trust in SSAs programs.  

BACKGROUND:  The SSA has a strategic plan to provide 21st century services to the American people by reshaping policies and procedures to take maximum advantage of information technology (IT).  The Agency is adopting a new business process that is dependent on a skilled workforce, effective use of technology, and streamlined policies and procedures.  As outlined in the IT Vision, SSA needs significant investments in IT in order to change how the Agency does business, build a stronger IT foundation, and revamp Agency software and databases.

The Agency Strategic Plan charts the course that will enable SSA to maintain a strong level of performance on core workloads and to work towards long-term improvement of the services the Agency provides to the public by concentrating on four goals:

1.	Eliminate our hearings backlog and prevent its recurrence,
2.	Improve the speed and quality of our disability process,
3.	Improve our retiree and other core services, and
4.	Preserve the publics trust in our programs

OBJECTIVE:  The objective is to establish a competitive, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) follow-on contract vehicle using the procedures of FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 15 for Information Technology Support Services to support existing programmatic and administrative systems within the Social Security Administration as well as new Agency strategic initiative, projects and functions.  These information technology support services will include all stages of the application software development lifecycle, with an emphasis on requirements analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, and support of the programmatic, administrative, and management information needs of the Agency.  

 
Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to gauge interest from industry who is willing to provide the Information Technology Support Services described in Section B of the attached draft solicitation.  SSA will also use the RFI responses to help develop a Request for Proposal that will lead to the award of a contract(s) for this effort.  

SSA seeks information from industry for preliminary planning purposes ONLY.  This RFI will allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the governments requirement and to affirm that there is a general understanding of the requirement.  This RFI is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or to award a contract.  The Government will not pay for information provided in response to this RFI or any follow-up information requests.  

A detailed description of the project is contained in the attached DRAFT RFP.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation.  

Questions pertaining to this RFI must be submitted via email to Kim.Stepney@ssa.gov by 10:30 a.m., est on August 14, 2009.   No phone calls will be accepted.  Responses to Questions will be posted via Federal Business Opportunities on August 24, 2009. We emphasize that this RFI is for planning and information purposes. No solicitation exists; therefore, requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS) has sought competition under the Federal Supply Schedule 520, Financial and Business Solutions (FABS), for Asset Management Support Services to conduct a Rent to Useable (R/U) study.   Attached for review and comments are the results of the study.  

Background:  Created by the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972, the purpose of the Federal Building Fund (codified at 40 U.S.C 592 a) is to provide a source of funds (rent) for GSA to manage its inventory.  The FBF is financed by revenue from rental charges assessed federal government occupants for space, which GSA is legally responsible to maintain.  The rental charges, by law (40 U.S.C. 586), are determined by the GSA Administrator and shall approximate commercial rental rates for comparable office space. 

Similar to the private sector, the rental charges for GSAs owned inventory is based upon the area that the tenant occupies with the rent charges determined by Fair Annual (FAR) Rent appraisal.  Each space assignment is documented in an Occupancy Agreement between GSA and the federal agency occupying the space.  The Agreement states the financial terms, the floor area and the conditions of occupancy.

GSA uses the Building Owners and Managers (BOMA) Standard Method for Measuring Floor Area in Office Buildings in its Federal buildings.  The Standard was originally created in 1915 as a means of measuring tenant space and has been updated over the years with the latest modification made in 1996.  
	
Previous versions only measured space on a floor-by-floor basis.  The latest one provides a building-wide method of measurement that allows spaces that benefit all the building occupants (the common area) to be apportioned to the tenants on a pro-rata basis. The revision produced new terms (floor useable area, floor rentable area, floor common area, and building common area) into the lexicon of commercial real estate, which GSA has since adapted to its Government buildings.  But the conversion has not been a simple process for GSA because its buildings are not easily adapted to private sector standards.  

Public spaces in Federal Buildings do not easily translate to the standard common area configuration in private sector office buildings where space is designed to be efficient and cost effective.  Tenants in the private sector typically pay a pro rata share of the cost to maintain the common areas.  If the common area comprises 15% of the building, the landlord will increase or load on a 1.15 factor to the tenants useable area.  Most leases are silent as to how this ratio is calculated and simply address the rentable square feet and the applicable rental rate.  So if the tenant occupies 1,000 useable square feet, it is charged rent on 1,115 rentable square feet.  This load factor can be influenced by market forces and the interaction of supply and demand, which will ultimately affect the final calculation that appears in the lease agreement.  

The Rentable to Useable (R/U) ratio in GSAs Federal buildings are often much higher than in private buildings.  Federal Buildings have large plazas, lobbies, atria and grounds that are significant public areas for the communities that they serve.  Hallways in Courthouses provide attorney-client conference areas.  Lobbies in the Federal Office Buildings provide gathering areas, cultural displays and agency information.  This common area space can be significant.  While a portion of the differential is often attributed to the difference in function, inefficiencies can exist in the layout of federal buildings; from the long double-loaded corridors to the expansive basements.  In the past, appraisers did sometimes adjust for building efficiency, but such adjustments were subjective and difficult to quantify.   

In an attempt to put the core factor for its Federal Buildings on par with private sector buildings, GSA adopted the Regional Appraisers Summary of Rates form (copy attached) in 2005 to further adjust its R/U ratio after it obtained its FAR (Fair Annual Rent) appraisal.  But the form has unintentionally introduced major concerns into the rent calculation process.

Request for Comments:  Please note that this Request for Comments (RFC) is in accordance with the terms and conditions under GSA Task Order GS-P-00-08-CY-0134 dated August 21, 2008.  

All comments should be address in writing no later than Friday, August 14, 2009, and submitted to General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Office of Organizational Resources, Center for Acquisitions (PGE), Ms. Paris N.

Summary of Architect-Engineer Project

The General Services Administration (GSA) is to procure Design/Build (D/B) services for the projects listed above as part of the American Reinvestment Recovery Act (ARRA) program for DC Service center, National Capitol Region (NCR).

1.	GSA requires an A/E Firm possessing the experience and skill sets to write the D/B Scopes of Work for the four projects listed above. One A/E firm will be selected to develop scope for all four projects. GSA has energy studies for all projects except for Marton Bostetter Building. Building description and system description for each project is also available to use while preparing re-commissioning/tune up task. The design-build contractor will ensure that all OPR outlined in these documents are being implemented and commissioned for the optimize performance.    

2.	The project manager shall generate a project team including architect, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, historic preservation, structural, lighting and roofing consultants etc. as needed to attend meetings with GSAs customer agency, survey the project site and develop a scope of work for the projects listed above. Life Safety, Fire Protection, Safety and Industrial Hygiene requirements developed in the Design/Built project will be reviewed for compliance by GSA WPYG group.
 
3.	The project team shall incorporate GSA requirements and customer agency requirements into the scope of work. Refer to GSA-PBS-P100 Design Criteria and requirements for details and include the requirements into the SOW where they apply.

4.	The A/E will be responsible to perform tune up per specification. The design/built scope should include the recommendations from the outcome of tune up performance. The Retro-Commissioning Study Report shall be prepared in the format per specification and the data shall be filled in the template per specification. Re-commissioning /Tune up is required to the extent A/E should be able to identify energy conservation opportunities such that a comprehensive design-build scope can be prepared. The intent of tune up is to use the control assessments associated with the retro-commissioning effort to primarily help identify work elements for the design-build RFP and also to make a minor control adjustment without major shutdown of the facility and to get equipment back on (control) schedules. The successful bidder will be doing all the field survey in addition to re-commissioning/tune up. It is recommended that to assure operational sequences work correctly, all control points virtually will be checked. ARRA Lighting Expert Consultant statement of Work is included to provide guidance about lighting options and recommendation through project delivery. The lighting report shall be prepared for the savings in energy and cost due to use of energy efficient fixtures/lamps and all types of sensors used for controlling the lighting fixtures similar to Retro-Commissioning Study Report. 

5.	Based on the SOW, provide a budget estimate for the project (construction cost), design man-hours estimate for each discipline and design fee estimate for the project.

6.	The project team shall develop the SOW by using GSAs generic format providing guideline for a design/build projects. The project team shall also provide requirements for each discipline as required.  After GSAs review and approval, GSAs Contracting Officer will request bids from Design/Build contractor.

<DESC><p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Services, National Capital Region, Washington, DC intends to&nbsp;award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for a 6-month performance period from August 1, 2009, through January 31, 2010, with two 3-month option periods. The current contract, expires July 31, 2009, provides Commercial Facility Management Services (CFM) for the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATFE) Building located at 99 New York Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20002. GSA has started the process of soliciting a replacement contract, but has encountered major human resource obstacles. As a result of AFTE's stringent security requirements, there is insufficient time for GSA to otherwise immediately procure these services without encountering a lapse and/or impairment of services. Therefore, this sole source extension is necessary to bridge the gap between the current contract and the new award, thereby ensuring the overlap of contract performance required for the achievement of a smooth transition and continuous high-level service.</p>
<p>Description of the work to be performed: The contractor is to furnish all material, labor, equipment, supervision and services necessary to perform full CFM for a&nbsp;twelve (12) month period, inclusive of the aforementioned options, for the ATFE Building. The contractor will be responsible for full building management services and is fully responsible for the management, customer service, operation, mechanical maintenance, janitorial services, elevator operations and maintenance, snow removal, energy management, management of parking facilities, loading dock, trash facilities, utility systems and quality control and engineering of the facility and of the associated grounds with all necessary labor, materials, supplies, technical support and value engineering.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>This extension is issued to facilitate continuation of services. A lapse in service will have a highly detrimental effect on the ability of the ATFE to provide its services to the public. This extension will provide services without disruption for the operation of the ATFE Building by a firm that holds current high-level security clearances and that is also familiar with the complexity of the facility and the equipment. Potomac Services, Inc. is the incumbent CFM contractor and is fully capable of continuing to perform for the additional 12-month performance period.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, as no solicitation package will be issued. However, if a firm believes it can meet these requirements within the prescribed time frame, it may give notification via e-mail to Jerome Lofton, Contract Officer, at jerome.lofton@gsa.gov. The Government will review all responses, without prejudice; whether or not the Government initially determines that another firm is fully qualified to fulfill the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Contracting Office Address: <br />General Services Administration <br />Public Buildings Service<br />National Capital Region<br />301 7th Street SW, Room 710 <br />Washington, DC 20407</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Savannah District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W912HN-09-C-0015, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, W Kerr Scott Reservoir, Wilkesboro, North Carolina, awarded to Re-Engineered Business Solutions of Frederick, Maryland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, this modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to renovate various campgrounds throughout the W Kerr Scott reservoir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing and water systems. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <br /><br />The existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources that are needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each area and at each camp site. 2) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of both of these campgrounds. 3) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 4) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year. <br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act. Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts. The Savannah District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements. Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as an 8(a) set aside. The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work. Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. </span></p>

The Government is not competing these items on the open market as they are a small, but integral part of a furniture package for the BEQ Located at Marine Corps Air Station Beaurfort, SC. To split this award to multiple vendors for the open market items would have a negative impact on the integrity of appearance and compatibility to the agencies existing packaged items.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04BC25C with Eloret Corporation on a sole-sourcebasis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of AmesResearch Center's (ARC) Code TS, Space Technology Division. The objective is to extendthe performance period for five months. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services underSpace Technology Research and Development (STRAD). The principal purpose of this contractis to support the Space Technology Division at NASA Ames Research Center to obtain theservices needed for the development of technologies for use in the design and fabricationof prototype vehicles that travel at hypervelocities in the atmosphere of Earth and otherbodies in the solar system. The Contractor provides support in the areas of Reacting FlowEnvironments, Nanotechnology, Thermo-Physics Facilities, and Thermal Protection Materialsand Systems. This extension will allow for a continuation of services to ensure programcontinuity and critical mission support and avoid significant technical impacts while acompetitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04BC25C,for a period of five months, from March 1, 2009, through July 31, 2009, and increase thecontract value for the period of the extension.   The current contractor, EloretCorporation, is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the shortperiod of performance for the extension. Awarding a five-month contract to anothersource, at the same time evaluations in support of the recompetition of the follow-oncontract is in process, would not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, therebyaffecting the seamless continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs requirements. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 PM PST onFebruary 9, 2009. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Lana Jones Clemon at Lana.Jones.Clemon@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact. Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary.  Provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status. During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.  Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours.  Replacement will be at the contractor's expense.

3. Descriptive Literature: The offeror shall provide descriptive literature that clearly demonstrates that the product offered meets the Governments minimum physical, functional and performance requirements. Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the product offered. Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

FAR 13.106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers  The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this quotation and will award one firm-fixed price contract to the  responsible offeror whose quote is the lowest price, technically acceptable offer.  Technical acceptability will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis based on the descriptive literature demonstrating that the vehicle offered meets the salient characteristics of the brand name item.

FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addenda to 52.212-4; the following clauses apply:

(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items within 30 days after date of contract award. 
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offerors proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Governments required delivery schedule as follows:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items within 60 days after date of contract award. 
Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.
OFFERORS PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: All items within _____ days after date of contract award. 

(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractors date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

<DESC>Synopsis: 

The USPFO for Colorado requires Architect-Engineer (A&E) Services and intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Statewide for the Colorado Army and Air National Guard. However, the primary purpose of this A/E selection is to acquire Master Planning, Design, and Construction Purview services for the Colorado Springs Armory located at the U.S. Air Force Academy.  Therefore, the Government requests that firms provide their SF330 package for each of these two requirements (one for the Master Planning, Design and Construction Purview of the Colorado Springs Readiness Center, and one for the IDIQ contract).  It will NOT diminish the firms opportunity to be selected if they provide a package for the Colorado Springs Armory project only or for the IDIQ only.  If you believe one submittal suffices for both requirements, please note this on your transmittal letter.  The Government reserves the right to contract for BOTH requirements in a single IDIQ contract if the selection process outcome for both of these requirements supports this.  Although there is not a limitation on the total dollar amount of awarded Task Order, it is estimated the total yearly award amount will not exceed $2 million. The ID/IQ contact will be awarded for one (1) base year and will contain an option to extend the contract for four (4) additional one year periods. Should the option be executed, the total contract period would be five (5) years and the total contract amount will not exceed $10/million. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders will be awarded. In the unlikely event that a task order is not awarded under the contract and option period if executed, a guaranteed one-time fee of $1,000 will be paid under the contract. Upon completion of the selection process, negotiations will be conducted to establish desired Architect-Engineering disciplines hourly rates, direct, indirect and general and administrative overhead rates, profit and other cost elements (Geotechnical and Topographical  Services) or in the case of the Armory project a firm fixed price contract will be award after completion of the Project Criteria Review Conference and negotiations. Upon establishment of the loaded hourly rates, Task Orders hours based on the level of effort required to provide complete design services will be established for the project. The scope of design services may include, but may not be limited to; architectural, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, LEED Accredited Professional, geotechnical, topographical, facility commissioning services, environmental for design of new construction and repair and alteration of multi-use facilities,  utilities, pavements etc.  Expected A&E services may require any combination of the following: Type A /investigative, project concept development, studies etc.; Type B design (B services shall not exceed the 6% statutory fee limitation); Type C, professional inspection, construction surveillance support services, on-site construction inspection, and code and criteria review. The ID/IQ contract may require the preparation of engineering type studies, facility project books, Operation & Maintenance Manuals and/or design-build performance statements of work. Interested A/E Firms shall be evaluated on the following evaluation factors and selection criteria, included in descending order of importance; (1) Previous satisfactory performance (quality, time, and budget); (2) Specialized experience with administrative, education, and warehouse facilities and experience in energy efficiencies and recovered materials; (3) Availability of key personnel throughout project master planning, design and construction; (4) Location of office that would provide the predominant percentage of design services and work history in the Colorado Springs area (this factor would not apply to the ID/IQ selection) (5) Capacity to meet schedule; (6) Experience with National Guard Readiness Centers (this would not apply for the ID/IQ contract) rather (6) Location in the general geographical area of Denver and Colorado Springs CO. and knowledge of the locality market conditions; (7) volume of work awarded by DoD during the previous 12 months. Failure of a firm to address its specified qualifications will result in the incontrovertible determination that the submittal will be considered non-responsive. This acquisition is restricted to small businesses. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. The Small Business size standard is $4,500,000. Cover letters and extraneous materials ARE NOT desired and WILL NOT be considered by the selection boards.

This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5. This solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.</p>
<p>All offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential quoter to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to keith.bubar@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>

<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519, with the exception provided for Information Technology Value Added Resellers with a size standard of 150 employees.

<p>52.204-11 AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT-REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2009) <br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Contract", as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. "First-tier subcontract" means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act.<br />"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. <br />"Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. "Total compensation" means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractor's past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c) (2)): <br />(1) Salary and bonus. <br />(2) Awards of stock, stock options, and stock appreciation rights. Use the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004) (FAS 123R), Shared Based Payments. <br />(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. (4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. <br />(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified. <br />(6) Other compensation. For example, severance, termination payments, value of life insurance paid on behalf of the employee, perquisites or property if the value for the executive exceeds $10,000.<br />(b) This contract requires the contractor to provide products and/or services that are funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Section 1512(c) of the Recovery Act requires each contractor to report on its use of Recovery Act funds under this contract. These reports will be made available to the public. <br />(c) Reports from contractors for all work funded, in whole or in part, by the Recovery Act, and for which an invoice is submitted prior to June 30, 2009, are due no later than July 10, 2009. Thereafter, reports shall be submitted no later than the 10th day after the end of each calendar quarter. <br />(d) The Contractor shall report the following information, using the online reporting tool available at www.FederalReporting.gov. <br />(1) The Government contract and order number, as applicable. <br />(2) The amount of Recovery Act funds invoiced by the contractor for the reporting period. A cumulative amount from all the reports submitted for this action will be maintained by the government's on-line reporting tool.<br />(3) A list of all significant services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor invoiced in this calendar quarter. <br />(4) Program or project title, if any. <br />(5) A description of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract, including significant deliverables and, if appropriate, associated units of measure. <br />(6) An assessment of the contractor's progress towards the completion of the overall purpose and expected outcomes or results of the contract (i.e., not started, less than 50 percent completed, completed 50 percent or more, or fully completed). This covers the contract (or portion thereof) funded by the Recovery Act. <br />(7) A narrative description of the employment impact of work funded by the Recovery Act. This narrative should be cumulative for each calendar quarter and only address the impact on the contractor's workforce. At a minimum, the contractor shall provide- <br />(i) A brief description of the types of jobs created and jobs retained in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). This description may rely on job titles, broader labor categories, or the contractor's existing practice for describing jobs as long as the terms used are widely understood and describe the general nature of the work; and <br />(ii) An estimate of the number of jobs created and jobs retained by the prime contractor, in the United States and outlying areas. A job cannot be reported as both created and retained. <br />(8) Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers of the Contractor for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded if- <br />(i) In the Contractor's preceding fiscal year, the Contractor received- <br />(A) 80 percent or more of its annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(B) $25,000,000 or more in annual gross revenues from Federal contracts (and subcontracts), loans, grants (and subgrants) and cooperative agreements; and <br />(ii) The public does not have access to information about the compensation of the senior executives through periodic reports filed under section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a), 78o(d)) or section 6104 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. <br />(9) For subcontracts valued at less than $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual, or subcontracts awarded to a subcontractor that in the previous tax year had gross income under $300,000, the Contractor shall only report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded in the quarter and their aggregate total dollar amount. <br />(10) For any first-tier subcontract funded in whole or in part under the Recovery Act, that is over $25,000 and not subject to reporting under paragraph 9, the contractor shall require the subcontractor to provide the information described in (i), (ix), (x), and (xi) below to the contractor for the purposes of the quarterly report.

</p>
<p>52.217-6,&nbsp;Option for Increased Quantity (Mar 1989)
<p>The Government may increase the quantity of supplies called for in the Schedule at the unit price specified. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within [insert in the clause the period of time in which the Contracting Officer has to exercise the option]. Delivery of the added items shall continue at the same rate as the like items called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>The CheckPoint items required by NIST are proprietary and available from only CheckPoint authorized resellers and no other types of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The manufacturer, CheckPoint, is the only manufacturer of products that will meet the agency's needs.<br />This procurement is for eight pairs of CheckPoint firewall appliances and three CheckPoint manager appliances. These appliances will be used within the NIST IT network security infrastructure to upgrade six of the existing firewall pairs, upgrade three of the firewall managers, and extend the infrastructure by adding two new pairs of firewalls. This network security infrastructure includes both the NIST Gaithersburg, MD and Boulder, CO campuses.</p>
</p>
<p>Firewalls are highly customized devices that are integrated into a network infrastructure with extensive security policies defined for each pair. Replacing some of the existing firewall appliances with another vendor's appliances would add significant costs and complexity to the existing infrastructure and be disruptive to productivity during the transition process. Specifically:<br />- Firewall policies, once defined by NIST staff and authorized by NIST management, are translated from descriptive text into CheckPoint firewall objects, services, and rules prior to being deployed to the corresponding firewall(s). To date, the firewall team has over 1,900 policies deployed across all firewalls. These firewall policies are defined and deployed using integrated firewall policy managers. NIST has two policy managers which are synchronized and, due to their critical nature, are located at both NIST sites and an additional backup manager. The procurement of another vendor's firewall appliances would result in a major firewall conversion process for the appliances being replaced, a complex and extensive redeployment of the corresponding firewall policies, ongoing complexity with NIST having to maintain multiple independent firewall policy managers (disrupting the integrate policy management environment in place today), a requirement for multiple policy managers located at each site, and a more complex and costly environment to maintain in the future.
<p>NIST also has nearly 1,000 users of the CheckPoint remote access application known as SecureClient which is integrated with the CheckPoint firewalls. These users have installed the SecureClient software on their remote computers and use it to access NIST when off-site. Any other firewall vendor's product would have a different remote access application that would need to be configured, tested, and provided to these users who would then need to uninstall SecureClient and install the replacement product. This change could not be done gradually due to the need for the hardware change.</p>
<p>NIST has several site-to-site Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with other government agencies based on CheckPoint firewalls at both the NIST and other agency end of the VPN. The impact of replacing some of the NIST firewall appliances with another vendor's firewall appliances on these established VPNs is unknown.</p>
<p>NIST staff is trained and certified on CheckPoint firewalls and has extensive experience with its deployment, operation, and maintenance. Having consistent firewall hardware and software is essential to the efficient and effective management of the NIST Network Security Service. In addition, having like hardware and software enhances NIST's ability to provide Continuation of Operations (COOP) and Disaster Recovery in a consistent and cost-effective manner across both campuses.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>This item is particular to one manufacturer, CheckPoint. The specifications of CheckPoint's products are essential to the Government's requirements, and recent market research indicates that other companies with&nbsp;similar products do not meet the agency's needs. CheckPoint products, maintenance, and support are available through CheckPoint authorized resellers only. According to the CheckPoint website, there are 686 resellers in the United States.<br />All authorized, responsible resellers of CheckPoint products are encouraged to provide a quotation for the requested items, and all quotes received from CheckPoint authorized, responsible resellers will be considered.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include-</p>
<p>(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Terms of any expressed warranty; <br />(4) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price for each item in the attached Microsoft Excel document and discount terms; <br />(5) Evidence that the Offeror is authorized by CheckPoint to sell CheckPoint products; and <br />(6) If the quotation is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. <br />(c)Period of acceptance of Offers. The offeror agrees to hold the price in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the dates specified for receipt of offers. All quotes shall be received not later than 3:00 PM Eastern Time on August 10, 2009 at keith.bubar@nist.gov. Faxed quotes will not be accepted.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a purchase order to the responsible, and CheckPoint authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation represents the lowest price to the Government. Only quotations that fully address and meet the technical requirements of all required contract line items in the attached Microsoft Excel document will be considered for award.</p>
<p>The following clauses will be included in the resultant purchase order: <br />52.212-4 <br />52.212-5 Alternate II, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3 and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a) (1) and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.203-15 (see full text above), 52.204-11 (see full text above), 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, and 52.232-33.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quote Q9504090004 is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a RFQ.  Submit written quotations only; oral quotations will not be accepted.  This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far.   This proposed procurement is unrestricted; all responsible sources may submit a quotation that shall be considered by the agency.  The North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 334419, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation will result in award of a firm, fixed-price contract.
The National Park Service has a requirement for delivery of GPS telemetry collars that will allow researchers to remotely download GPS telemetry data from free-ranging elk, and gather data on sightability of elk during aerial surveys for use in designing elk monitoring protocols.  The objective of this project is to determine population distribution of Roosevelt elk during times of the year that the National Park Service conducts aerial surveys of abundance.   To meet that project objective, specialized GPS telemetry equipment is required that allows the researchers to communicate with radio collars remotely.  Bidirectional communication with the GPS collar (i.e. researcher to collar AND collar to researcher) is required so that researchers may remotely and on-demand both retrieve data that is stored aboard the GPS collars and to change the scheduling of GPS radio-collars.  The GPS collars shall be delivered no later than September 8, 2009.  The collars are needed for air surveys scheduled to start September 15, 2009.  
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY:  The government already has on hand 3 radio-receivers in the specified frequency range and two handheld terminals for UHF radio communication with Vectronic Aeropace GPS Plus series radio-collars.  If the contractor's proposed collars are not immediately compatible with the existing Vectronic Aeropace GPS Plus hand-held UHF communications terminals, then contractors shall specify in quote the type of software and hardware needed to program collars, retrieve data, process data, and reschedule radio-collars.  The collars need to be able to collect and transmit data for greater than 5 years. The GPS collars must be less than approximately 1200g and have sufficient battery capacity to acquire at least 9000 telemetry locations under less than ideal conditions (eg. Terrain and vegetation interferes with GPS reception and the unit searches for satellites for 180 seconds).  The GPS collars must have bi-directional remote communications systems so that 1) data may be downloaded from the collars remotely on demand  2) there is built in error checking so that we can be assured that we are getting the complete and accurate dataset, and 3) data remains stored in the collar until it is retrieved.  In addition the communication device must allow new telemetry schedules to be uploaded to the collars remotely.  This is a long term study, therefore it is required that the radio-collars function reliably for no less than 5 years.  
SPECIFICATIONS :  1) Mortality sensor 2) Long range Bi-directional communication-	Ability to download data with error checking function in data transmission-	Complete and accurate data downloads-	Ability to reschedule radio-collars on demand-	Data includes: animal location , fix date and time, fix accuracy-	Transmitted data not erased from collar memory3) Multiple color, high visibility, radio collars for use in re-sight surveys (eg yellow, blue, white, orange).4) Battery life for no less than 5 years with schedule of 4 fixes per day and no less than 180 seconds for fix acquisition at 0C.5) Software to enable easy translation of data into ASCII, Google Earth, and spreadsheet or relational database (DBASE) formats

Written Technical Submission:  Each vendor shall provide one (1) original and three (3) copies in hard copy or an electronic version of the following:A written narrative demonstrating the capability of the company and/or its subcontractors to meet or exceed the minimum requirements listed in this scope of work.  The written technical submission is limited to a total of twenty-five (25) pages(includes corporate experience and technical approach), excluding the resume for the Program/Project manager, single sided, twelve (12) pitch, one inch borders on all sides.
Factor 1:  CORPORATE EXPERIENCECorporate experience refers to the experience acquired by a corporation as a whole, as opposed to the experience of individual firm members. The offeror shall demonstrate relevant corporate experience.  Relevant corporate experience is experience, which, either individually or in the aggregate, (within the past five years) is directly related to or similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the PWS attached hereto  For purposes of this evaluation, relevancy in scope, magnitude and complexity are measured by the following: 
Scope:  Experience in the areas defined in the Performance Work Statement (performing facility condition assessments (FCA) in a hospital environment identifying and prioritizing facility maintenance and repair requirements.	
Magnitude and complexity  Is the measure of similarity of technical and managerial intricacy and required coordination of efforts and disciplines that exists between the PWS/SOW and the vendor's performance on other contracts.  For complexity, not only will the tasks performed be considered, but also the vendor's ability to coordinate the tasks (e.g. concurrent facility assessments at multiple sites and geographical locations.)
Vendors shall provide up to THREE (3) specific projects performed by their firm, or a critical subcontractor or teaming contractor, completed within the past five (5) years (yet to be performed work or experience prior to the last five years will not be considered) that are most relevant to performing facility condition assessments (FCA) in a hospital environment identifying and prioritizing facility maintenance and repair requirements, as set forth in the attached PWS, as follows: 
a.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience developing specific solutions for defective conditions identified during assessments with regard to Joint Commission Environment of Care standards.b.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience in prioritizing maintenance and repair work based on the assessments and understanding of facility equipment and component failure rates and the risk associated with deficiencies identified in assessments.c.	The vendor shall demonstrate experience in providing data management, detailed reports, recommendations and estimates based on those assessments.
Vendors shall provide the following information for each specific example listed:
1.	Contract number and title2.	Brief description of work performed including type of facilities assessed and required reports.3.	Period of performance4.	Total size (in SF/SM of area) of facilities assessed5.	Dollar value (per year)6.	Location7.	References (Name, Current telephone)8.	Detailed explanation demonstrating s how the listed contract examples are relevant in experience to the requested work.
Note: If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the relevant reference, the percentage of work to be performed by the referenced subcontractor under this contract shall be provided.  Subcontractor experience will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the quote submitted.  It is also noted that the references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow vendors who may not have the same scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual project to still be considered acceptable if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references above. 

Factor 2:  TECHNICAL APPROACH
This factor considers the effectiveness of the vendor's organization and approach that will satisfy all of the requirements of the contract, including Quality Control.  The Government seeks a comprehensive and effective approach that will maximize quality, be cost effective, and result in identifying, prioritizing and estimating facility maintenance and repair requirements for BUMED assets.  The vendor shall submit a detailed work plan  describing their technical approach, work plan and contract management strategy, which addresses the following:
a.	Provide a proposed organizational chart that demonstrates the flow of authority, responsibility, and communication between home office staff, the on site personnel providing the assessments, and organizational relationships with any proposed subcontractors.b.	Indicate how you will plan, schedule, coordinate, monitor and perform worldwide assessments.c.	Provide job descriptions for personnel you plan on using to perform assessments and a resume for the proposed Program/Project Manager.  Based on your proposed schedule, provide the number and type of personnel you will use during the period of performance for the assessments.  Describe how you will provide the staffing and equipment needed to perform this contract.  Describe your ability to maintain program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional employees worldwide.d.	Indicate how you will assure quality assessments, accurate estimates, etc.  Submit a separate document \, outlining your firms internal quality assurance / quality control procedures for both technical / field work and report production.e.	List any subcontractors you plan to use, the estimated percentage of work they will perform, and indicate to what extent your firm has worked with the proposed subcontractors in the past. f.	Discuss how you intend to train personnel to use the VFA Facility software.  As part of the pre proposal conference the Government will provide a demonstration of the VFA Facility software on August 18, 2009.  Contact Ann Hager, Email: anne.hager@navy.mil to reserve a spot for the demonstration.g.	Discuss how you will ensure timely and accurate data entry into the VFA program database. h.	Provide an example of strategic and tactical estimates required in the solicitation.
PART II- PRICE
Vendors shall submit a completed Price Schedule (Attachment J-0200000-04), executed Representations and Certifications, and if applicable, executed copies of all Amendments,  Price quotes shall be held firm for sixty (60) days after the closing of this combined synopsis/solicitation.
PART III.  PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Attachment I, Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire shall be submitted for each project included under Factor 1, Corporate experience.  Ensure that correct phone numbers and e-mail addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed Past Performance Questionnaires are to be sent from the client via e-mail or fax directly to the Government, and shall not be submitted via the vendor or its team members. Completed questionnaires shall be emailed to jean.1.mann@navy.mil or faxed to (757)322-4166. 
EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following criteria shall be used to evaluate quotes: Corporate Experience, Technical Approach, Price and Past Performance.
(b) A written order in response to the vendor's quotation will be e-mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful vendor.  The Contracting Officer may ask the vendor to provide written acceptance of an order.  In other circumstances the vendor may indicate acceptance by proceeding with the services ordered.
Quotations will be evaluated in two Phases as follows:
a) In Phase I, Part I, Factor I, Corporate Experience shall be evaluated.  The Government will evaluate corporate experience to determine if the vendor has demonstrated relevant experience in performing facility condition assessments in acute care hospital/clinic/medical research facilities similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to the work in the PWS.  
If Corporate Experience is found to be unacceptable, the quote will be determined to be technically unacceptable and will no longer be considered for further evaluation or award.
b) In Phase II, the vendor's Technical Approach, Price submission, and Past Performance will be evaluated.
PART I -Factor 2:  TECHNICAL APPROACH
The Government will evaluate the vendor's technical approach to rate the vendor's understanding of the work to be performed, and their ability to staff, plan, schedule and coordinate worldwide assessments, and to maintain the facility software database in accordance with the requirements of the PWS.  
Note:  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to exclude vendors whose technical submittals have been determined to be unacceptable from further evaluation of price and past performance. 
PART II:  PRICE
The vendor's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3.  
Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.  
Note: In the event a vendor submits a technically acceptable quotation with a non-competitive, high price when compared to the government estimate and/or other technically acceptable quotations, the Government, at its discretion, may not evaluate that vendor's past performance submission and eliminate that vendor's quotation from further evaluation and consideration for award.  
PART III:  PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance will be evaluated after the Contracting Officer has completed the technical and price evaluation.  The Government will determine whether the vendor's past performance submissions are, in order of preference, relevant, somewhat relevant or not-relevant projects, based on three factors: scope, complexity and magnitude.  
Relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of all three factors.Somewhat relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of some of the three factors.Not-relevant - the past performance submission fails to meet the criteria of all three factors.For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the vendor on the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The vendor acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the vendor fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Vendors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government, including Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS).
The Government will evaluate the vendor's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a vendor's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  
The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.
SELECTION
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Subpart 13.1.  The Government shall select the vendor whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other criteria (technical submission and past performance) when compared to other quotations.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced vendor.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government. 
Please direct questions to Jean Mann at (757) 322-4662 or jean.l.mann@navy.mil
Vendor(s) must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.

<p>(I) this is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation document is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). Submit written proposals for RFQ number DOL099QP20757.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35.</p>
<p>(IV) This acquisition is set aside 100% for Small Businesses. The associated NAICS code is 541512. The small business size standard is $25M.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services:</p>
<p>01. Create a Web Site entitled, "National Non-Traditional Occupations (NTO) for Women", in accordance with the Statement of Work identified in Paragraph VI below:</p>
<p>The period of performance will be for a period of one year from the date of award.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>I. Background</p>
<p>The Women's Bureau (WB) continues to carry out its responsibilities under Public Law 66-259; 29 U.S.C. 11-16.29 (1920) to formulate standards and policies that promote the welfare of wage-earning women, improve their working conditions, increase their efficiency, and advance their opportunities for profitable employment. It is the only Federal agency mandated to represent the needs of wage-earning women in the public policy process.</p>
<p>The Women's Bureau is interested in assisting women in achieving greater economic independence through increasing their wages. One of the primary employment sectors that can provide such economic self-sufficiency is in non-traditional occupations (NTO). The U.S. Department of Labor defines a non-traditional occupation for women as one in which less than 25% of those employed in the field are women. In 2008, there were 4.2 million women in NTO which was just 7% of all employed women. Women are under-represented in many occupations, including those in the trades, technology, and science fields, which typically pay well.</p>
<p>Women employed in non-traditional jobs earn higher wages than women employed in traditionally female occupations. According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, in 2008 the median weekly earnings of women who worked full-time were only 78% of men's weekly earnings. Research has shown that part of the overall reason statistics show women generally earn less than men is because they aren't typically employed in occupations that pay better, such as in the non-traditional occupations. When choosing a career, women, as well as men, should consider all the options available to them.</p>
<p>The WB outlines its current initiatives under the theme "Better Jobs! Better Earnings! Better Living!" In carrying out its initiatives, the WB often works with entities that share its goals and priorities pertaining to America's working women.</p>
<p>This project was created, in part, as a response to one of the WB's constituent populations, those who work, train, and employ women in the non-traditional occupations for women sector. This sector requested that the WB create a national Web site devoted to the issues, concerns, and information needs surrounding NTO and the particular needs of women who desire to work in these fields.</p>
<p>II. Purposes/Objectives</p>
<p>This project supports the Secretary's vision of "Good Jobs for Everyone," as it will give women the "opportunity to build a better life for their family and live the American Dream," as well as help them "acquire the skills and knowledge needed to become or remain employable in middle-class jobs." The primary objectives of this contract align with the WB's "Better Jobs!" Initiative, which is part of its 2007-2015 Strategic and Performance Plan.</p>
<p>The primary goals of this project are: 1) to create and maintain an innovative Web site entitled, "National Non-Traditional Occupations (NTO) for Women," that shall provide information and resources to entities and individuals interested in, or connected to, non-traditional occupations for women; 2) to provide a means of increasing women's interest in, and awareness of, employment in non-traditional occupations, that can lead them to achieving greater economic independence; and 3) to provide a unique and interactive Internet forum in which non-traditional workforce development professionals, employers, and unions can communicate, access, and share information and resources, including NTO employment availability within specific sectors across the country. This forum shall also provide a means to gather and analyze data submitted by registered users pertaining to the usefulness of the site.</p>
<p>III. Scope</p>
<p>Under this project, the contractor shall provide a creative and innovative Web site offering timely and relevant information on non-traditional occupations for women across the country. It is critical that the contractor have a proven record of established relationships with entities whose mission is to provide training and/or services to working-women interested in non-traditional occupations. This is important, as the Web site shall also serve as a national networking tool for entities employing or training women in NTO, women interested in NTO, and current DOL and other Federal grantees involved with NTO for women. The Web site shall provide links to pertinent information, resources and other Federal agencies. This information shall include available DOL and other Federal grants or contracts related to NTO for women, current NTO employment and training opportunities, best practices and lessons learned from DOL and other Federal grantees that train and educate women in NTO; and other resources and information that would prove helpful to women and NTO entities.</p>
<p>This Web site shall provide community-based organizations (CBOs), workforce development professionals, employers, and unions with a unique means to network and improve their outreach efforts and services to women, and assist them in increasing the number of women who successfully enter NTO training and employment opportunities. It shall also assist women by connecting them to relevant and helpful supportive services.</p>
<p>The National Non-Traditional Occupations (NTO) Web site shall offer, in part:<br />&bull; A clearinghouse of news, information, best practices, and free online resources related to non-traditional employment and training;<br />&bull; Interactive non-traditional career exploration activities for women;<br />&bull; Specific information on various non-traditional occupations;<br />&bull; NTO Tool Kits;<br />&bull; Information on women's rights in the workplace;<br />&bull; Internal/external links to:<br />o NTO training providers and employers;<br />o NTO legislation, including legislative analysis and guidance;<br />o Federal and state resources, such as descriptions of programs and projects funded through Federal and State legislation;<br />o NTO advocacy organizations;<br />o Research papers and books; <br />o A downloadable version of the Women's Bureau's "A Woman's Guide to Green Jobs;" <br />o A resources network (publications, links, employment information, referrals and best practices)<br />o Interactive blog site;<br />o Videos;<br />o New and existing non-traditional occupations programs.</p>
<p>Visitors to the Non-Traditional Occupations Web site shall be able to link directly to the client page that most appeals to their needs and interests. Each client page shall feature ongoing and "rotating" free resources, many of which could be customized and downloaded by visitors. There shall be a "best practices" link to other resources and a forum for users to share information. The site shall also provide a comprehensive online publications database for locating and ordering available printed resources. All online resources shall be available as "text only" and with or without sound cards, to ensure that the site is accessible to an audience with a broad range of technological capacities. An online feedback mechanism shall also be included to ensure that the Web site meets the needs of clients.</p>
<p>The Web site shall be created with future expansion in mind.</p>
<p>IV. Tasks</p>

<p>1. Prepare a detailed Performance and Technical Assistance Plan, with a timeline, to show the planned design and development of the Web site.

(See 29 CFR 4174)<BR><BR><BR><BR>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1)  Does not apply to employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative,<BR>or professional capacity as defined and delineated in 29 CFR 541.  (See CFR 4.156)<BR><BR>2)  APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL:  An employee is<BR>entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.<BR>at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of<BR>the rate of basic pay.<BR><BR>3)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<BR>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<BR>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<BR> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<BR>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<BR>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<BR>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<BR>overtime work).<BR><BR><BR>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<BR>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<BR>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<BR>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<BR>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<BR>and photoflash powder.

These differentials<BR>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<BR>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<BR><BR>UNIFORM ALLOWANCE <BR><BR>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<BR>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<BR>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<BR>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<BR>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<BR>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<BR>following standards as compliance:<BR><BR>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<BR>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<BR>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<BR>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<BR>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<BR>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<BR>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<BR>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<BR>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear<BR>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<BR>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<BR>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<BR>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<BR>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<BR><BR>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<BR>Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, Fifth Edition, April 2006,<BR>unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<BR>links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<BR>gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<BR>http://wdol.gov/.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<BR>1444 (SF 1444)}<BR><BR>Conformance Process:<BR><BR>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<BR>not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<BR>be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<BR>determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<BR>relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<BR>classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such<BR>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<BR>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<BR>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<BR>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<BR>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<BR>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<BR>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<BR>conformed.<BR><BR>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<BR><BR>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<BR>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<BR><BR>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<BR>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<BR>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<BR>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<BR>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<BR>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<BR>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<BR>performs any contract work.<BR><BR>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<BR>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<BR>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<BR>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<BR>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<BR><BR>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<BR>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<BR>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<BR>the request.<BR><BR>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<BR><BR>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<BR><BR>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<BR><BR>When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of<BR>Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<BR>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<BR>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<BR>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<BR>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<BR>classifications listed in the wage determination.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><p>Clarifying some questions recently recieved: <br />"11 Pallets (Max 10,500lbs ea)" refers to weight concerns. In the furture our customer may need to store 11 Pallets (108" x 98") with a max expected weight of 10.5k lbs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Does the mezzanine need to be clear span underneath or can there be a few support columns?<br />A: there can be some supports</p>
<p>Q: The 12' that you have distinguished as the height of the mezzanine, is that under steel or is that top of deck?<br />A: 12 feet to the bottom of the under floor support</p>
<p>Q: Do you want a stair access system for the mezzanine?<br />A: yes</p>
<p>Q: Are we to supply the conveyor and, if so, is there a layout?<br />A: Yes, and the layout would be rolling from front (the 28 foot end) to the back (there is, however, no drawn layout)</p>
<p>Q: Are we responsible for bringing power from the main to the mezzanine? If so, what is the distance from the main to the mezzanine?<br />A: Yes, it is approx. 45 ft.</p>
<p>Q: For the conveyor - is the conveyor powered or gravity?<br />A: Gravity</p>
<p>Q: Why is it necessary to be able to remove the floor? Why can't the pallets be stored on a solid floor?<br />A: The floor will be a basic resindeck or plywood that is layed over the rollers. The pallets cannot be stored on the ground due to not being able to get a forklift on the mezzanine. The floor will later be removed by the customer when they are ready to store pallets. For the time being it will used to store lockers.</p>
<p>Q: Do the rollers/temporary flooring need to cover the entire floor?<br />A: It is preferred that the rollers cover the entire floor as well as the temporary flooring.</p>

<DESC><p>Modification #3 is to post received questions and responses.</p>
<p>Question #1: Is there a particular form or format you would like quotations to conform to?<br />Answer: There is no standard format in which we require vendor quotes to be based on. We do, however, require that the quote comes in on company letterhead.</p>
<p>Question #2: The RFQ is titled "Vertex Encryption Software," but it appears that the Bureau does, indeed, require the entire radio with the encryption capabilities installed. Is that correct?<br />Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>Question #3: You are requesting twenty (20) firmware options (999-8750), but only nineteen (19) VX-7200 mobile radios (100-5625), and nineteen (19) AES/DES Encryption Software (400-0996.) Is that correct or should the radio and encryption lines also read twenty (20) each, so that they match the firmware quantity?<br />Answer: The quantity has been corrected and should read:<br />-Seventeen (17) each Firmware Z545-M, Special Feature Set, Preloaded into Units (999-8750)<br />-Seventeen (17) each Vertex VX-7200-DO-50, 134-1774MHz VHF, 50W, 501Ch Grp, P25 Digital Mobile Radio with Display Screen and MH-25A8J Mic (100-5625)<br />-Seventeen (17) each Vertex VX-7200-DO-50, 134-1774MHz VHF, 50W, 501Ch Grp, P25 Digital Mobile Radio with Display Screen and MH-25A8J Mic (100-5625)<br />-Seventeen (17) each Vertex VX-AES/DES-M Encryption Software Option for VX-7100/VX-7200 P25 Digital Mobile Radios (400-0996)</p>
<p>Question #4: The FBI has obtained more information on the radios. Requested items in this RFQ MUST have:<br />-Encryption key Selection via the Portable Radio's Keypad. This feature will give the user the capability to select, on a per channel basis via the radio DTMP keypad, any of up to sixteen encryption keys that have been pre-loaded into the radio.<br />-Unencrypted Channel Alert Tone. This feature will enable user to activate, on a per channel basis, an audible alert tone that will sound when the PTT button is depressed in "clear mode" (i.e. unencrypted channel) to alert the user that his transmission is unencrypted. In addition, the LED on the radio front panel will change in color.<br />-Increased Alias Table Capacity. This feature will increase the capacity of the current alias table from fifty-six names or tags to more than two hundred-fifty names or tags.<br />-Zeroize Feature. Using a sequence of keys on the radio keypad, user will be able to remove all encryption keys on a unit without the use of a computer, thus allowing easy, in-the-field transfer of unit to the other user unauthorized to use encryption.<br />-Radio-to-radio clone function will allow transfer of the "Encryption Keys Index." While the keys themselves will not transfer during cloning for security purposes, the "pointers" showing which keys apply to what channels will transfer. Once keys are loaded using a KVL-3000, the keys will become active per channel.</p>
<p>Question #5: This RFQ is no longer on hold, and has been extended through 08/13/2009 at 11:00am EDT. Please submit quotes to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Theresa Powell, via email at Theresa.Powell@ic.fbi.gov. If you have previously submitted a quote and would like to replace the original with an updated quote, please specify this in your email. Thank you.</p>

Solicitation Number:  FDA1060796

Response Date: 14 August 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541910 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following data and service: 

Medical Device Exposure Dataset Identification and Evaluation

Background:

FDA routinely obtains reports of adverse events occurring throughout the life-cycle of medical devices.  These reports come from the sponsor in the IDE prior to device marketing.  Upon clearance/approval of the device, reports may come from a post-approval study (PAS) or through medical device reports (MDRs).  As opposed to the well documented exposure information in the IDE study, post-marketing exposure to medical devices is difficult to ascertain.  It is often limited to information from passive surveillance or from single-institution case series analysis.

Knowing the number of individuals exposed to a medical device is key to many of FDAs post-marketing efforts to determine whether public safety is maintained throughout the device life-cycle.  Use of exposure data would allow FDA to know the proportion of device users reporting adverse events via MDRs.  It would also allow FDA to determine whether post approval studies have difficulty recruiting due to slow device uptake.  In the event of potential safety signals for a medical device, exposure data would allow FDA to determine the number of people potentially affected by the adverse event as well as whether adequate substitutes for a medical device are present in the marketplace in the event of a recall.

Representative, nationwide data for medical device utilization at the manufacturer and device-specific levels would offer the opportunity to derive more accurate rates of outcomes.  To address this need for better information, FDA is asking for identification and evaluation of potential data sources for exposure to medical devices in the United States.  For this initial assessment, data focused in on of three areas is requested.  The areas of specific interest are gastroenterology/urology/renal, infection control/dental/general hospital/infusion pumps, or neurology/anesthesia/respiratory.

Objectives:

By the end of this evaluation of potential data sources, our objective is to identify the most appropriate medical device exposure dataset(s) available for purchase by or collaboration with FDA to assist with ongoing post-market device safety evaluation.

Scope of Work:

The scope of work of this project is the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. data measuring exposure to commercial medical devices.  Data evaluated in this project should be representative of the population exposed to the devices or able to be extrapolated to represent use in the U.S. population. 

This project shall require a thorough analysis of each set of identified data: (1) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (2) method of data collection and extrapolation to US population; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up (if any) and capture of care across all settings; (4) plans for further enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of data compilers or investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of data, including HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of data; (7) cost of data and updates; and (8) potential barriers that exist to government use of data.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

(ii) The solicitation number is FDA-SOL-09-1056133 and is being issued as a "Brand Name or Equal To" Request for Quotation (RFQ).  

(iii) This solicitation and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-35.  

(iv) The NAICS code is 541511 and the small business size standard is $25M.  The Government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order for a base plus two option years and reserves the right to issue an award without discussions.  

(v) & (vi):  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)  Center for Food and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is seeking Advanced Signal Detection Software that can detect potential food or cosmetic safety signals in CFSAN's Adverse Event Reporting System database (CAERs) and Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of the Advance Signal Detection Software.  Please see the attached Statement of Work for more detail on this requirement.

(viii)   The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

1)Technical Understanding and Approach. The proposed content will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in part V of the SOW.  Contractors shall furnish as part of their quotation all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether their service meets the technical requirements. The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Minimally Acceptable", "Acceptable", or "Exceptional". A score of "Minimally Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology minimally met the requirements and demonstrated to be difficult to implement. A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed technology fully met the requirements and demonstrated its ability to be implemented. A score of "Exceptional" would mean that the proposed technology exceeded the requirements and would be easy to implement. 
2) Past Performance: Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed with other federal agencies during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offer or has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services. This is a matter of judgment. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's past performance record. Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance. Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.

3) Small Business Subcontracting Plan: (Applies to large businesses only in the event the total proposed cost inclusive of all options exceeds $550,000) Offerors will be required to demonstrate the extent of their small business participation through the submission of a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with the criteria set forth in FAR 19.704 Subcontracting Plan Requirements and 52.219-9 Small Business Subcontracting Plans".  The Offeror shall use the template in Attachment 3 to develop its small business subcontracting plan.   

4) Price. The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a 12 month base period plus two option period. Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

 (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition. 

(xii) The clause FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUN 2009), applies to this acquisition as well as the following clauses cited therein:

Requirements and specifications that shall be met by the purchase:  

A.  General Requirements:  The systems that FDA requires shall use an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach.  It shall use robotics to extract and isolate DNA from samples, followed by transfer to a PCR thermal cycler to amplify the DNA after introduction of particular, and specifically chosen, primers.  Once the amplification has been completed, the sample will be robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry.  A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms.  The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps.  By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices.  The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.

f.  Braking time from max. speed: <25 s
4. Biosensor requirements
a.  PCR-based amplification of DNA from samples to produce amplicons of 100-120 base pair length, using carefully selected primers that can classify organisms generally or specifically.
i.   PCR Assay and clean-up kit:  This kit contains ten 96-well plates with pre-selected PCR primers that amplify carefully selected regions of DNA to produce products in the size range compatible with the mass range and resolving power of the mass spectrometer.  These PCR primers are selected based on the target study and can provide general or specific information about the nature of the organisms in question.   The primers are specifically designed by IBIS.  Internal standards are also included in the kits.
b.  Robotic cleanup of PCR amplicons.
i.   Automated desalting and cleanup module:  This component consists of a robotic heat sealer which seals the 96-well plates so that they cannot be contaminated, followed by robotic desalting and clean-up of the PCR amplicons.  Desalting is done on magnetic beads.  This system is designed to minimize the possibility of sample contamination.
ii.   Robotics handles up to 15 plates at one time, and contains reagents to handle all 15 plates
iii.   Processing rate:  30 seconds per well 
c.  Sample injection fluidics module:  A custom fluidics module is designed to sample each purified mixture with minimal cross contamination and introduce it into a liquid stream at a carefully controlled flow rate for subsequent ESI-MS analysis.  The system alternates between high flow rates (for cleaning between samples) and lower flow rates (200 microliters per minute) for the analytical steps.  The module precisely controls injection volumes as well.  The injection system controls the voltages on the electrospray source so that the system is not electrospraying while higher cleaning flow rates are being used between samples.
d.  Electrospray TOF-MS analysis of amplicons at high mass accuracy (<20 ppm).
i.   Mass spectrometer system for DNA detection:  This component consists of an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF) for analysis of PCR products introduced by the sample injection fluidics module.  This instrument consists of an orthogonal injection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an off-axis sprayer.  The orthogonal injection source allows for ion accumulation prior to MS analysis to improve sensitivity.  The TOF contains a reflectron to insure high mass resolution.  The mass spectrometer is controlled software that is integrated into IBIS Control software.  The instrument has the following specifications:
1. Standard mass range 500  2,000 m/z
2. Mass resolution 10,000 FWHM or greater in standard configuration at m/z 1034
3. Mass accuracy of 3 ppm (RMS) error with internal calibration in negative polarity
4. Mass accuracy of 20 ppm or less (RMS) error with external calibration
5. ESI orthogonal electrospray source (1l 1 ml/min)
6. Instrument control software
e.  High throughput analysis capability of over 1500 PCR products per day.
f.  Control and Analysis Software
1. Robotics Software:  controls and coordinates the sample handling and sample injection processes by controlling the robotic components of the system.  This includes the cleanup and injection portion of the analysis.
2. Control software:  This component manages the liquid flow system and the mass spectrometer (by interfacing with the mass spectrometer software), as well as integrates the total operation of the system
3. Sample tracking software
4. Relational database:  Curated database of genomics information that contains base counts (composition) for primer pairs for microorganisms.  This database contains sequences generated by known primers for a large number of microorganisms.  The information is maintained for primers that are designed to differentiate at the family level (e.g. enterobacter) and at the species and strain level.  This database is a unique and indispensable part of the system, since base compositions stored in this database will be compared with those generated experimentally.  This component is critical for rapid detection and proper identification of bacteria.  
5. Analysis of the masses of complementary DNA strands to identify unique composition (based on DNA strand complements) of bases in strand.
6. Comparison of base composition to library of known base compositions (for given primers) for known organisms
7. Data Processor:  Analyzes mass spectrometry data from both forward and reverse strands of amplified DNA to generate the unique base composition for the sequence in question.  It function is to then compare the generated base composition to a database of known base compositions that would be generated from sequences produced for a given set of primers.

<DESC>DWI sanctions have generally focused on punishing, rehabilitating, or incapacitating the drinking driver.  Recently, the use of the ignition interlock devices has emerged as part of a comprehensive treatment program as an effective means for addressing DWI offenders.  Several research studies show that ignition interlock has been effective in decreasing repeat offenses.
	
Ignition interlocks are alcohol breath-testing devices installed in vehicles that require the operator to blow in order to start or maintain the vehicles engine operating.  If the breath sample provided by the driver contains more than a predetermined blood alcohol concentration, the ignition interlock device prevents the vehicle from being started.  To meet the model specifications set by NHTSA, the ignition interlock device must not only require a breath test to start the vehicle, but it must also require a subsequent rolling or running retest to prevent another person from starting the vehicle and then allowing an impaired driver to take over the wheel.  The ignition interlock system records the results of all breath tests, as well as all attempts to circumvent or tamper with the device. With modern safeguards, these devices are extremely difficult to circumvent when properly installed and monitored.

To prevent a convicted DWI offender from driving while intoxicated, courts or the state department of motor vehicles (DMV) or motor vehicle association (MVA) may require the installation of an ignition interlock device on the offenders vehicle.  An ignition interlock program can serve as a deterrent to DWI and protect public safety while allowing DWI offenders to maintain their responsibilities such as driving to and from work.  NHTSA recognizes that ignition interlock devices must be part of a comprehensive program that includes, but is not limited to, sound legislation, enforcement, treatment for alcohol misuse, monitoring, and reporting.

Laws, programs, and use of the ignition interlock vary from state to state.  While there are studies on the effectiveness of its use and compilations of information related to state laws and the latest technology, there is little written guidance on implementing and developing ignition interlock programs.  A program guide of case studies that highlight successful ignition interlock programs currently being operated by States, courts or communities is needed to assist and encourage others to replicate or enhance these types of programs.  The final product of this effort is intended for use by State highway safety office representatives, program managers, program practitioners, court administrators, department of motor vehicle representatives, policymakers, or others who are interested in developing and implementing or enhancing ignition interlock programs to reduce
In the body of this solicitation it say's that this is full and open, This is a 8(a) set aside.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Request for Quote Q9504090004 is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a RFQ.  Submit written quotations only; oral quotations will not be accepted.  This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  Clauses and provisions can be found at http://www.arnet.gov/far.   This proposed procurement is unrestricted; all responsible sources may submit a quotation that shall be considered by the agency.  The North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code is 334419, with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation will result in award of a firm, fixed-price contract.
The National Park Service has a requirement for delivery of GPS telemetry collars that will allow researchers to remotely download GPS telemetry data from free-ranging elk, and gather data on sightability of elk during aerial surveys for use in designing elk monitoring protocols.  The objective of this project is to determine population distribution of Roosevelt elk during times of the year that the National Park Service conducts aerial surveys of abundance.   To meet that project objective, specialized GPS telemetry equipment is required that allows the researchers to communicate with radio collars remotely.  Bidirectional communication with the GPS collar (i.e. researcher to collar AND collar to researcher) is required so that researchers may remotely and on-demand both retrieve data that is stored aboard the GPS collars and to change the scheduling of GPS radio-collars.  The GPS collars shall be delivered no later than September 8, 2009.  The collars are needed for air surveys scheduled to start September 15, 2009.  
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY:  The government already has on hand 3 radio-receivers in the specified frequency range and two handheld terminals for UHF radio communication with Vectronic Aeropace GPS Plus series radio-collars.  If the contractor's proposed collars are not immediately compatible with the existing Vectronic Aeropace GPS Plus hand-held UHF communications terminals, then contractors shall specify in quote the type of software and hardware needed to program collars, retrieve data, process data, and reschedule radio-collars.  The collars need to be able to collect and transmit data for greater than 5 years. The GPS collars must be less than approximately 1200g and have sufficient battery capacity to acquire at least 9000 telemetry locations under less than ideal conditions (eg. Terrain and vegetation interferes with GPS reception and the unit searches for satellites for 180 seconds).  The GPS collars must have bi-directional remote communications systems so that 1) data may be downloaded from the collars remotely on demand  2) there is built in error checking so that we can be assured that we are getting the complete and accurate dataset, and 3) data remains stored in the collar until it is retrieved.  In addition the communication device must allow new telemetry schedules to be uploaded to the collars remotely.  This is a long term study, therefore it is required that the radio-collars function reliably for no less than 5 years.  
SPECIFICATIONS :  1) Mortality sensor 2) Long range Bi-directional communication-	Ability to download data with error checking function in data transmission-	Complete and accurate data downloads-	Ability to reschedule radio-collars on demand-	Data includes: animal location , fix date and time, fix accuracy-	Transmitted data not erased from collar memory3) Multiple color, high visibility, radio collars for use in re-sight surveys (eg yellow, blue, white, orange).4) Battery life for no less than 5 years with schedule of 4 fixes per day and no less than 180 seconds for fix acquisition at 0C.5) Software to enable easy translation of data into ASCII, Google Earth, and spreadsheet or relational database (DBASE) formats  
PRICE SCHEDULE:  Provide price quote that includes 1) the GPS collars (price per each and any quantity discounts available, including delivery F.O.B. Destination), and 2) all other software and hardware needed to program collars, retrieve data, process data, and reschedule radio-collars.  If the contractor's proposed collars are not immediately compatible with the existing Vectronic Aeropace hand-held UHF communications terminals, then contractors shall specify in quote the type of software and hardware needed to program collars, retrieve data, process data, and reschedule radio-collars.  The Government will purchase as many collars as funds will allow, estimated quantity ranging from five to ten each, or more, depending upon the unit price quoted per collar and the required delivery date of September 8, 2009.  
DELIVERY:  The GPS collars shall be delivered no later than September 8, 2009.  Delivery of the collars shall be arranged by the contractor and shall be F.O.B. Destination to Olympic National Park, 600 East Park Avenue, Port Angeles, Washington 98362-6757
CLAUSES & PROVISIONS:  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this solicitation.  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, in descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) price, and (2) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement, and (3) delivery lead time.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post the questions and subsequent answers to this solicitation.  Contractors should be reminded that evaluation of quotes will be based on strengths and weaknesses identified within the quote and the award will be given to the vendor who represents the best value to the government.Question 1: Any confirmation of the TGA-MS that is being targeted for purchase uses a sniffer system would be of interest and if it does not, we will look to see if we can provide a MS that has a range to 1000 AMU.Question 2. It states the analyzer can go up to 1100 ? C. Does this mean it must go up to 1100 deg C, or would 1000 deg C suffice? If 1100 is a ?hard? spec, our entire system, which is the only real one-company, integrated TGA/MS, or TGA/GC/MS available from anyone.Question 3. It states that it ?should include a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample crucible?. Our experience is that if a system can do this, the volume of the TGA is such that it will adversely affect the MS or GC/MS analysis.Answers:  The Mass spectrometer of the TGA-MS system should be capable of high mass ranges, high unit resolution at throughout the mass range, and high sensitivity.The specification number 11 states that  the mass spectrometer shall have  mass range up to 1000 AMU,  The higher AMU is desired but the value is not critical, which means if the system does not meet this criteria it will not be rejected from consideration. 
The TGA furnace should heat up to 1000 deg C.  The 1100 deg C in the spec is a "soft" target.  However, EPA  intends to make sure that the furnace should heat to 1000 deg C.  
Exact measurement of the sample temperature is critical for these tests. There could me different ways of ascertaining that this specification is met.  In that case the vendor can state if it has a system that can measure sample temperature in more exact way.   Thermogravimetric Analyzer with Emitting Gas Analyzer using Mass SpectroscopyThis is a combined solicitation/synopsis for a commercially available bench scale thermogravimeteric system coupled with emitting gas analyzer with mass spectroscopy.  This solicitation/synopsis is for commercial items exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, although prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.  This requirement is being solicited on a full and open competition basis.  A firm fixed price contract award is anticipated.  The NAICS code is 334516 with the small business size standard of 500 employees.  Award will be made to the offer that represents the best value, i.e., the offer that is most advantageous to the Government, considering both technical and price.  For this requirement, price may not be the deciding factor.  Each offeror shall provide a technical proposal that demonstrates it?s equipment meets or exceeds each of the below specifications as provides past performance.  Offers shall provide a firm fixed price for the system. Technical Specifications include:  1.The system should be used for compositional qualitative and quantitative analysis of various samples, for thermal stability, and oxidative stability. 2.The thermal gravimeteric analyzer can go up to 1100?C in almost any atmosphere with a heating from room temperature to maximum at in less than 10 min. 3. The temperature measurements of the samples should include a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample crucible and have high accuracy: ?0.25 ?C / ? 0.5 ?C (up to 1100 ?C) with a wide linear heating rate. 4. The forced cooling rate for1000? C to 50 ?C will be in less than 15 min. 5.Temperature calibration can be made with either electromagnetic coil or cuie point standards. The TGA should allow that the calibration is independent of heating rate, purge gas and pan type or provide an easy way to correct this without the need to recalibrate the instrument or manually change calibration factor. 6. TGA should include an automatic gas controller that allows for switching and mass flow control of up to four gases. 7. The TGA should have an internal balance with a capacity of up to 1000mg sample although a typical sample size for the analysis will be around 10 milligrams with balance resolves to 1 microgram or 0.1 %. The base line dynamic drift is less than 10 micro gram. 8. System has high sensitivity and allows the analysis of a wide range of polar and non-polar components samples. 9. The evolved gas can be routed to the mass spectrometer for identification. 10. The system can have the option of gas chromatograph for trapping the evolved gas and resolving the mixture before routed to the mass spectrometer though low volume, heated transfer lines to avoid condensation. 11. The Quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) can measure the gas evolved from the thermal decomposition of the sample integer mass unit up to 1000 AMU. The MS will have a very low detection limit, typically picking up materials in the PPB range, with high signal resolution. 12. The sample chamber in the furnace should be tightly sealed to allow full control of the atmosphere to which the sample is exposed. The active part of this chamber will made of fused silica, so that samples can be exposed to many reactive gasses. The system is equipped with an easy selection and precise control the gases. 13.This TGA-MS system is flexible, robust, and very easy to use. The temperature ramp is fully and easily programmable with both dynamic and isothermal base line stability. 14.Both the TGA -MS include hardware / software that allow controlling the system, collection and analysis of data and the transfer of the data in different program formats.  The following clauses apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commerical Items; FAR 52.212-2 evaluation-Commercial Items; 9See below technical Evaluation Criteria).

<CONTACT>Jason M. Holman, Contract Manager, Phone (310)416-1634, Email jason.holman@losangeles.af.mil - Jon L. Hobart, Procurement Contracting Officer, Phone 310-416-1778, Email jon.hobart@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is seeking interested contractors to provide a second SBSS Block 10 satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. The follow-on acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in late 3rd qtr FY10 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. The Government intends to use the responses to this synopsis to determine whether or not a sole source contract will be appropriate.
<p>All responsible sources that believe they are capable of fulfilling a Prime Contractor role for an operational satellite system shall submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) which shall be considered by SYSW. The SOC should identify concepts that leverage existing heritage space programs, minimize non-recurring development efforts, with high technology readiness levels (TRL). The candidate concepts must have a solution capable of meeting SBSS Follow-On requirements and delivering on the aforementioned launch schedule. Prime contractor SOCs should include the following information: Company name, address, primary POC including phone number; brief technical summary of TRL 8 or greater concepts to meet this need; evidence of ability to meet demanding schedule; evidence of optical payload, spacecraft and ground development and integration expertise for space programs; knowledge of Air Force Space Command SSA; evidence of capability to support operation and maintenance pertaining to space systems, description of facilities and equipment available for use in support of this effort; ability to obtain use of facilities for processing.</p>
<p>In order to receive a copy of the Secret collateral Technical Requirements Document (TRD), potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 07 August 2009 to Catherine Detro at catherine.detro.ctr@losangeles.af.mil who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret TRD to an authorized facility.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the review of the SOC, potential Prime Contractors will be invited to Industry Day. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to four (4) attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, and IAW JAFAN 6/0 and 6/4 which meets Tier 1 Standards. If a person is not currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, then an updated SF-86 signed within the last year must accompany the SAP Format 1. If the person is currently briefed to a SAP sponsored by SYSW, then only the SAP Format 1 is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Discussions". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one (1) or two (2) page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.</p>
<p>Requests for requirements documents or other inquiries must be submitted to the following email addresses: jason.holman@losangeles.af.mil, jon.hobart@losangeles.af.mil, william.caldwell@losangeles.af.mil and <a href="mailto:ted.shoepe@losangeles.af.mil">ted.shoepe@losangeles.af.mil</a>. Responses to this synopsis must be received via email to the addresses above by 1 September 2009 in electronic format (MS Word 2000 or newer, or PDF) and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font. Submittals must not exceed 20 pages in length. Submissions should include the following format: Executive Summary, Concept Description, TRL Assessment, Compliance w/ TRD Requirements, Schedule, Experience with Optical Space Surveillance Systems, Facilities and Equipment, Security, Logistics and Sustainment, and Summary. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with the points of contact listed above. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel. Response from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill, USAF AFSPC SMC/PK at (310) 653-1789.</p>

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Tongass National Forest (the Tongass) recently finished its Forest Plan Amendment. To implement the amendment, the Tongass needs to develop project plans that allow implementation of the Forest Plan (the Plan) (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/2008_Forest_Plan.pdf) as described in the Record of Decision (ROD) (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Record_of_Decision.pdf). The complexity of the management situation requires a vegetation model to help implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy (http://tongass-fpadjust.net/Documents/Media_Files/Timber-AdaptiveMgmtStrategy_887040_300dpi.pdf). The model is needed to assist in the designing management strategies for actual on-the-ground projects that meet Forest Plan direction and display progress towards the forests desired condition. The model should have the ability to: analyze large inventory data sets and complex rules; calculate timber harvest level considering the Plan management goals, objectives, and constraints; project effects of management on wildlife habitats; perform financial efficiency analyses; and assist in the development of a road building and maintenance strategy.

A primary purpose of this acquisition is to train Tongass staff in using a vegetation model and to help develop a range of alternatives for feasible land management projects for a pilot project. The Tongass will select an initial project to evaluate a watershed (or perhaps a slightly larger area such as a Wildlife Analysis Area) with land management issues and objectives representative of the Tongass National Forest. Alternatives developed to implement the Tongass Adaptive Management Strategy will need to project the development of forest conditions over time, quantify the effects on wildlife habitat, and determine a harvest level that meets the objectives of the Plan. Wildlife habitat will be evaluated with incorporating deer habitat models such as Hanleys FRESH Deer Model (http://cervid.uaa.alaska.edu/deer/).  This acquisition also allows for any needed modifications to the vegetation model which are learned during the initial project and a full site license if the Tongass decides to adopt the model.

The model will be utilized to project the forest conditions over time by simulating the land allocations and management action of the alternatives.  The extent of this modeling effort when looked at from an entire plan revision perspective can seem large and complex. It is easier to understand the modeling by looking at the major components used in the model formulation. These major components  include; the GIS data which defines the land allocations and spatial representation of numerous  resources, the forest inventory data, growth and yield projections, road networks, the definitions of habitats and structural stages, the assumptions on habitat and structural stage development, and management assumptions to simulate the alternatives.

All arrangements for Contractor personnel travel, including airline reservations and motel accommodations, will be the responsibility of the Contractor.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY ACTION: The scope of the current task order is to obtain all services for deactivation, demolition, and removal of the Separations Process Research Unit (SPRU) nuclear facilities (Building G2, Building H2 and Tank Enclosures); cleanup and environmental restoration of the underlying and surrounding contaminated soil; and decontamination of piping tunnel connecting the SPRU facilities to other operating facilities. SPRU is located at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, in Niskayuna, New York. The completion date of the SPRU task order is changed from December 20, 2011 to September 30, 2011. Additionally, Recovery Act funds will be used for:
<p>a) The Temporary Access Road which includes the retaining wall, relocation of two utilities, grading, gravel road surface, and an access gate.</p>
<p>b) Building G2 and Pipe Tunnel - The G2 and Pipe Tunnel scope of work includes all activities associated with deactivation, decontamination, and demolition of the G2 building and demolition of the portion of the tunnel system below Building G2 and connecting Building G2 and H2. This includes incidental soil removal required for the D&amp;D, and restoration of the wall interface between buildings G1 and G2. The activity also includes the removal, packaging, transportation, and disposal of low-level radioactive waste and non-radioactive waste, and removal only for mixed low-level waste and transuranic waste, if present.</p>
<p>c) Building H2 and Tank Enclosures - The Building H2 and Tank Enclosure scope of work includes all activities associated with deactivation, decontamination, and demolition of the H2 building and demolition of the tank enclosures. The scope also includes incidental soil removal required for the D&amp;D of the H2 and tank enclosure.</p>
<p>The activity also includes the removal, packaging, transportation, and disposal of low-level radioactive waste and non-radioactive waste, and removal only for mixed low-level waste and transuranic waste, if present.</p>
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>The work discussed herein is the same work that is currently required in the original task order statement of work as awarded. Therefore, additional competition was not required. The original task order is a CPIF contract. Modifying this task order to utilize Recovery Act funds does not reduce the risk assessment of the work, so maintaining a CPIF type is appropriate. The contractor will be encouraged wherever possible to award subcontracts.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding in the amount of $27,920,000.00 is added to&nbsp;contract DE-AC30-06EW05001&nbsp;for infrastructure removal and structural demolition of the C-410/420 Complex, the C-340 Complex, and the C-746-A East End Smelter at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant site in Paducah, Kentucky.&nbsp; Contract DE-AC30-06EW05001 is a Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF) Small Business Set-Aside contract awarded to Paducah Remediation Services, LLC. The contract has been modified to extend the period of performance by nine months to June 30, 2010 and adds work scope for the continuation of environmental remediation activities including but not limited to remediation and disposition of specific areas on the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Site (land sites and groundwater) by removing legacy waste, performing facility decontamination and decommissioning, and operating the site waste storage facilities.
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Use of fixed price contracting is not feasible because the risk involved in environmental remediation work is high and cannot be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. Performance uncertainties cannot be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impacts cannot be made.</p>
<p>A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) was approved on July 24, 2009 by the DOE Senior Procurement Executive pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The contract extension will allow for continuation of the environmental remediation activities at the Paducah site until completion of the on-going competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.   DUNS 175252894.  The modification addresses the following work: Advance funding for the PHENIX Project Forward Vertex Detector MIE.  This project will thereby reduce the cost risk and schedule risk.  Specifically, this funding is provided to optimize project execution by advancing the schedule for some tasks as compared to the previously approved plan.  

The action is other than fixed price because this was awarded as a Cost-Reimbursement Type because of uncertainties in contract performance.  Costs cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  This is a collaboration between the Laboratories and a university for this project.  The work is described but not defined and is very complex in nature.  The modification was awarded under a Cost-reimbursable type contract and is other than fixed price.  LANS was selected by DOE to participate in this ARRA work as part of a Laboratory-University Collaboration due to LANLs expertise in the subject matter. The funds will now allow design, procurement, and testing and assembly of vital components for the PHENIX Detector, which is being installed at BNL.  The work falls within the Nuclear Physics Program of the Office of Science, which is allowed under the prime contract Section J, Appendix B. Statement of Work Section 3.3 entitled High Energy and Nuclear Physics of the current Contract based on the following paragraph:

The Contractor shall conduct high energy and nuclear physics research involving experimental and theoretical programs in nuclear and particle physics. 
  
NOTE:  This action is Modification A085 that recognizes Work Authorization No. KB/AL03/9/ARRA-2 (LASO # RA-09-009) issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC52-06NA25396.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding in the amount of $54,000,000.00 is added to contract DE-AC24-05OH20192 for demolition of the X-533, X-633, and X-760 inactive facilities including soil characterization and remediation, removal of source contamination at the X-701B groundwater plume, packaging and disposition of approximately 8 lots of uranium material, and treatment and disposition of approximately 72 large low enriched uranium LEU) cylinders at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant site. Contract DE-AC24-05OH20192 is a Cost-Plus-Incentive Fee (CPIF) Small Business Set-Aside contract awarded to LATA/Parallax Portsmouth, LLC (LPP). The contract has been modified to extend the period of performance through June 30, 2010 and adds work scope for the continuation of environmental remediation activities at the Portsmouth site. Remediation activities include, but are not limited to the following: demolition of the X-633 RCW, X-533 Switchyard, and X-760 Chemical Engineering Building; source contaminant removal at the X-701B Groundwater Plume; and disposition of material in the Uranium Management Center (UMC).
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Use of fixed price contracting is not feasible because the risk involved in environmental remediation work is high and cannot be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. Performance uncertainties cannot be identified and reasonable estimates of their cost impacts cannot be made.</p>
<p>A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) was approved by the DOE Senior Procurement Official July 24, 2009 pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The contract extension will allow continuation of the environmental remediation activities at the Portsmouth site until completion of the on-going decontamination and decommissioning (D&amp;D) competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - AJXF 069112 - ANGRC OPERATIONS CENTER. The Type "C" Construction Management Services for this project have been awarded on 31 JUL 09, and are funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Award is a Firm Fixed Price task order, W9133L-05-D-0001-9005, against a current multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Architect/Engineering (A/E) Services. Award was made to CH2M Hill, Incorporated, 11818 Rock Landing Drive, Suite 200, Newport News, VA 23606-4230 on 31 JUL 09. The amount of the task order is $449,951.83. The work includes Type "C" Construction Management Services, which consist of inspection services, the oversight of sustainable design requirements, responses to requests for information concerning plans and specifications, and reviews of submittal documents related to the construction of RECOVERY - AJXF 069112 - ANGRC OPERATIONS CENTER project on the ANGRC Campus, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because this is a task/delivery order where an exception to fair opportunity requirements was approved as this is a follow-on order to a competitive initial order (FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) or 16.505(b)(2)(iii)). This contractor designed the project and is managing other components of the Campus expansion and will bring continuity to the project. This task order is against the current pre-priced contract. The NAICS Code is 541310. Any questions regarding this award must be submitted in writing or via email to the point of contact contained in this announcement.</p>

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>53-7482-5-466
<DESC>This is a sources sought notice.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED AT A LATER DATE.  It is the intent of USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to award a sole source contract under the statutory authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 603-2-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplier or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract to Dartmouth University due to the very specialized skills deemed necessary to the successful continuation and completion of the project.   Dartmouth University has the background, skills and expert knowledge in the development of ArcSIE and its application to producing soil survey information.  This legacy best allows Dartmouth University to effectively and efficiently continue the development of the application.  Attempting to change developers at this stage would create vast inefficiencies not only in the development of the software, but also in the completion of the Essex County Soil Survey Project.  

The NRCS-NGDC is proposing to continue the development of the ARC Soil Inference Engine software (ArcSIE) developed at Dartmouth by hiring the only contractor with extensive direct experience in the programming and development of the SIE software.  
This award will: 1) Continue the development, enhancement and testing the ARC Soil Inference Engine (ArcSIE) software developed at Dartmouth University, 2) Continue to provide support to the Essex County, Vermont Initial Soil Survey project using ArcSIE as the principle modeling software to complete the initial mapping of the county including the following: a. Provide technical assistance on an as-needed basis (via telephone, e-mail, on-site visits, etc.) for the duration of the soil survey project, b. continue the development of the ArcSIE software for use in the Essex County Initial Soil Survey project, c. continue the development of training materials for the use of SIE in projects, around the country, 3) Facilitate the expansion of ArcSIE to other soil survey projects, 
4) Develop the Knowledge Discoverer module for ArcSIE which takes the polygons in an existing soil map and the user-specified environmental data layers as inputs, builds and displays the relationships between those polygons and the environmental factors (in the form of relationship curve), allowing the user to visualize, examine, evaluate, and modify these relationships in both graphical and statistical way, and finally output the updated relationships into a new knowledgebase, 5) Continue development of the ArcPen toolbox to directly modify polygon boundaries in a graphical way for viewing, digitizing, and editing vector features (points, lines, and polygons) over a 3D view of the landscape. The toolbox is created as an Extension of ESRIs ArcScene to take advantage of its powerful 3D functionality.

This is not a request for proposals or quotations and there will not be a solicitation issued for the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered. Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating an offeror's bona fide capability to provide the above services.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Such responses must be received on or before 2:00 PM, Central Standard Time, Wednesday, August 12, 2009.  E-mails will NOT be accepted and the Government will not pay for information solicited.  The estimated period for completion is December 31, 2010.

<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting<br />Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10<br />U.S.C. 2304(c).</p>

<p><br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority:<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description</p>
<p>5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications:<br />This procurement is for a CISCO Load Balancer which balances the loads on switches. Load balancing prevents network switches from being overwhelmed and thereby message traffic is balanced and speed is optimized. Operators, and users are currently trained to operate and maintain CISCO therefore USEUCOM has base lines it's network configuration with CISCO products. Cisco can provide a network load balancer that can be feasibly managed without increasing administrative overhead and hardware maintenance cost. Enterprise management tools, hardware maintenance, security update tools &amp; processes, auditing tools, and asset management of network devices are designed to support Cisco. Any other brand of network component would increase the Total Cost of Ownership by introducing a device that would require additional administrative overhead to manage/maintain. Currently USEUCOM has approximately $ invested in CISCO hardware, using another hardware element could potentially triple our investment since new accreditation, training, and replacement of all hardware would be required. The use of another brand name would introduce an unacceptable level of risk to the USEUCOM network since our network operations rely on seamless hardware compatibility. We can not jeopardize on-line collaboration, VTC capability, and command and control of forces by purchasing incompatible equipment. The purchase of a CISCO load balancer provides the most cost effective technology that meets the needs of USEUCOM, by not increasing administrative overhead and hardware maintenance cost; thus, maximizing the value and minimizing risks of this IT investment.</p>
<p>6. FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources:<br />The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12. All responsive offerors will be considered.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:<br />The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of Symantec software to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research:<br />The market research consisted of our technical experts speaking with different vendors that support this particular product and requesting cost estimates.</p>
<p>9. Any Other Supporting Facts:<br />None.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Interested Sources:<br />There are multiple resellers of Cisco Load Balancers to include CISCO, and IDI and INX.</p>
<p>11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition:<br />United States European Command J6 Directorate in Stuttgart must remain with the Cisco product line to ensure continuity, compatibility, reliability, and consistency. Competition is limited to multiple resellers of Cisco hardware.</p>
<p>12. Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule: <br />Anticipated delivery time is 30 days.</p>
<p>13. Reference to the Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)<br />N/A. AP not required.</p>
