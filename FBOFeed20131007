The estimated value of the contract is $361,702.70.</p>
<p>The Malaria FCC processes a large volume of blood and tissue samples (pre-clinical animal and clinical human) by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry allows simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of physical and/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second. Specifically, the Malaria FCC requires a Multi-Parameter High Throughput System Flow Cytometer comprising of 5 lasers capable of detecting light emitted at wavelengths of 355nm (Ultraviolet), 488nm (Blue), 405nm (Violet), 561nm (Yellow/Green), and 640nm (Red) from reagents in experimental studies in conjunction with the ability to detect other fluorochomes for multi-parameter analysis and identification. Additionally, the Malaria FCC requires a 640nm (Red) laser output of 100 watts. Furthermore, the Malaria FCC requires a Multi-Parameter High Throughput System Flow Cytometer that is compatible with the current LSRII flow cytometer unit and current workstation software utilized at the Malaria FCC. The Malaria FCC has established analysis panels for the simultaneous detection of 18 parameters.</p>
<p>Becton, Dickinson and Company is the sole manufacturer and supplier of the Fortessa. The Fortessa is capable of evaluating 20 parameters with the capability of expanding beyond a 5-laser/20- parameter system to a 9-laser/20+ parameter system. Becton, Dickinson and Company offers a 640nm (Red) laser output of 100 watts for the Fortessa. Furthermore, the Fortessa is compatible with the current LSRII flow cytometer unit and current workstation software utilized at the Malaria FCC. Becton, Dickinson and Company is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability. All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All capability statements received by 3:00 PM local time, 20 September 2013 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the St Louis, Missouri area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA St. Louis Health Care System, is composed of two divisions:  1) John Cochran Division, 915 North Grand Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63106, and 2) Jefferson Barracks  Division, 1 Jefferson Barracks Dr., St. Louis, MO 63125 (see map:  http://www.visn15.va.gov/v15/sites_cboc_map.asp)

The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about June 30, 2013, with a closing date for proposals on or about July 15, 2013.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide housing, care, treatment and rehabilitative services to homeless veterans, who may also be suffering from serious mental illness.  These community-based treatment facilities should offer a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

NAICS Code is 624221 with a small business size standard of $10M.  The solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, Required Central Contractor Registration and in accordance with FAR 2.101, Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 802.101, VetBiz Registration, prospective contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in VetBiz databases under the applicable NAICS.  Firms may obtain CCR information under the System for Awards Management (www.sam.gov) and Vet Biz information at http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov .  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) data base at www.sam.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit the website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Telephone requests for information or questions will NOT be accepted.  Please email requests or questions to dennis.putman@va.gov and ensure that the subject line includes: VA-255-13-R-0726.

Awards to responsive and responsible offerors will be made on the basis of best value to the Government using the following criteria:

"	Ability to provide requested services.
"	Assessment of need with consideration of relevant veteran population in specific areas.
"	Distance of contract facility from area of consideration
"	Number of available beds (male and/or female)
"	Current State License or Certification
"	Prospective Contractor must have current registration in SAM.
"	Prospective Contractor must have a current professional liability policy in the amount of $1,000,000 prior to award
"	Prospective Contractor must pass a VA exclusion review (fire safety, general safety, and compliance review conducted by VA personnel) prior to award

Placements will be made in contract facilities based on availability of facilities and the needs of the veterans.  Because it is impossible to determine actual delivery or quantify need for any day, the VA uses Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts with a guaranteed minimum of 1 veteran bed day of care for 30 days.

<DESC>Request for Information for Signal Enhancement in Collections (SEC)<br /><br /><br /><strong>1.0 Description</strong>
<p>1.1 The Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC) in support of its nuclear treaty monitoring mission is conducting market research on enhancing meteorological and transport &amp; dispersion modeling capabilities through methods for extracting more usable information from existing effluent observations.</p>
<p>1.2 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY</span>. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, 213AFTAC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background:</strong> Air samplers are commonly used to measure the airborne emissions from nuclear tests. When measuring trace quantities from low release rates or sources located at long distances, these samples tend to be taken over a long period of time. Often the material being measured is ubiquitous in the atmosphere and the concentrations can be highly variable making it difficult to determine the emission location and quantity that was emitted. Only measured samples that are significantly elevated relative to the background can be used to estimate the emission rates. A methodology is needed that can leverage current information to identify additional "collections of interest", thereby increasing the accuracy of the subsequent analyses. The methodology must be consistent with AFTAC's operational Ensemble Weather Research Forecast (E-WRF) system.</p>
<p>2.1 Technical Capabilities: This request for information is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of various companies to provide support. The contractor must demonstrate the capability to provide the following:</p>
<p>- Enhancements in identification of measured airborne emissions which are&nbsp;elevated relative to background for Transport and Dispersion Modeling.<br />- Utilization of mesoscale ensemble model uncertainty to extract more usable information from low trace quantity observations with smaller signal to noise ratio (must have experience with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model).<br />- Utilization of coupled atmospheric and transport and dispersion model to provide ensemble of reanalysis solutions to ultimately increase confidence of measured observations (must have experience using inline tracer capability in WRF).</p>
<p>2.2 Security Requirements: The contractor shall comply with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Procedures Manual (NISPOM) DOD 5220.22M. The classification of work, reports, and meetings may be up to the SECRET level. Management personnel, along with all technical personnel performing classified work, shall possess at least a SECRET clearance. The contractor shall establish and maintain a SECRET facility security clearance, and establish procedures for receipt, storage, and generation of classified material in accordance with DODD 5220.22.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Requested Information</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.0 Responses</strong></p>
<p>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI submit a Statement of Capabilities; the capabilities packages should be brief and concise, yet should clearly demonstrate the abilitiy to meet the stated requirements.</p>
<p>4.2 Capabilities Packages are <strong>due no later than 21 October 2013, 5:00pm EST</strong>. Responses shall be limited to 10 pages and submitted via e-mail only to [<strong>michelle.raines@us.af.mil</strong>]. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>4.3 Business type: Large Business (LB), Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), HUBZone Small Business (HSB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Business (EDWOSB) Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), an 8(a) firm, an Indian Tribe or Alaskan Native Corporation, based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541990, Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services . "Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than $14.0 million dollars in annual receipts. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years. Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52. Respondees are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards. The FAR is available at http://www.arnet.gov.</p>
<p><strong>5.0 Industry Discussions</strong></p>
<p>AFTAC representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks. Industry discussions requests will be considered until 16 Oct 2013.</p>
<p><strong>6.0 Ombudsman Clause, Nov 2012</strong></p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Ms. Veronica Solis, AF ISR Agency/A4-7, 102 Hall Street, Ste 258, San Antonio, TX 78243-7091 (P) 210-977-4505, (F) 210-977-6414, e-mail: veronica.solis@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p><strong>7.0 Questions</strong></p>
<p>Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to the Contracting Officer, email address. Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions will be answered by posting answers in the FedBizOpps; accordingly, questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 21 October 2013 5:00pm EST will be answered.</p>
<p><strong>8.0 Summary</strong></p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide Signal Enhancement in Collection (SEC). The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. AFTAC has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely to gather information for planning and market research purposes, and will not be publicly released.  In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e) and FAR 52.215-3, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated or paid for information solicited by it.  This is not a request for proposals; and therefore the Government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice. All information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.  Proprietary information should be clearly marked, and respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information furnished must comply with the Security Exchange Commission's confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review of the information provided, but may be contacted for additional information for clarification.   <br>  <br> The AN/MSQ-135 Mobile Tower System (MOTS) is a highly mobile tactical system designed to rapidly set-up and quickly establish air traffic services (ATS) during the initial phases of deployment, and sustain those services throughout operation and redeployment. The services provided by the MOTS include: sequencing and separating both arriving and departing aircraft; coordinating instrument meteorological condition (IMC) recovery of aircraft; and coordinating in-flight emergencies and personnel recovery actions. The MOTS is also tasked with the rapid restoration of terminal Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations during missions such as disaster relief or other Defense in Support of Civil Authority operations. The system is mounted on a Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV). The system is air deployable by C-17 and larger aircraft, is CH-47 lift-capable (when separated from the MTV), and meets international Air Traffic Control (ATC) standards with modernized, digital jam-resistant, and cryptographic secured communications.  MOTS will utilize the Tactical Operation Center Inter Communication System (TOCNET) software. The MOTS provides secure, jam-resistant radio communication capabilities using 10 multi-function very high frequency (VHF) / ultra high frequency (UHF) radios and associated antenna systems that can be selected for operation in either the VHF or UHF bands. The system includes and interfaces with an AN/ARC-220 radio to transmit and receive ground-to-ground and ground-to-air voice. The MOTS includes cables, masts, and antenna mounting hardware to remote RF antennas up to 80 feet from the shelter. The system also includes meteorological sensors and the capability to locate these sensors a minimum of 3,000 feet from the shelter to provide measurements of conditions where the aircraft will actually take off and land. The MOTS is able to interface with the Airfield Lighting System (ALS). A climate control system with Environmental Control Units (ECUs) is required for the shelter. The shelter provides room to allow four soldiers in the target audience (5th percentile female to 95th percentile male Soldiers) to move within the shelter without stooping or bending to avoid overhead obstacles and not come into contact with other personnel and equipment, while wearing combat and protective gear ECW, CW, or MOPP 4 clothing. The MOTS provides an operator console for a minimum of three operators that includes touch-screen, flat panel displays for data display. The shelter has a modular platform with stairs, or stair ladder, and handrail to allow safe entry and exit through the shelter door. The MOTS will provide an intermediate platform area with ladder, appropriate guardrails and toe board, suitable for allowing safe installation and removal of communication and collision avoidance equipment on top of the shelter. The shelter has a platform area with ladder, suitable for allowing safe maintenance of the shelter roadside windows. The windows of the shelter, except for the window located on the door, have a 15 degree slant preventing any reflectivity issues. The MOTS shelter is capable of dismounted (stand-alone) operations when the MTV is disabled, requires maintenance, is used for other transport, or the system is to be semi-permanently emplaced.  The MOTS will be fielded on the basis of one MOTS, per ATS Company, in each Airfield Operation Battalion and General Support Aviation Battalion.  Each ATS company provides terminal ATC for one fully instrumented airfield (MOTS, Ground-Controlled Approach RADAR/Air Traffic Navigation Integration Control/Coordination System (ATNAVICS), and a non-directional beacon) in theater.  These assets support main logistics bases that require airspace deconfliction and synchronization of a high density of fixed and rotary wing air traffic that is associated with high OPTEMPO operations.  The MOTS, when collocated with ATNAVICS, provides a near all-weather precision and non-precision approach, and instrument meteorological conditions recovery capability to aircraft operating within airspace designated for air traffic movement.  It also serves as the localized hub for communicating with combat search and rescue aircraft, medical evacuation aircraft, and provides current airspace/weather information to arriving and departing aircraft operating in the vicinity of its airspace.  The MOTS provides a capability to remote and operate the three operator positions at least 300 feet from the tower cab shelter, so that the operators can operate from a fixed based facility using MOTS system components.  <br>  <br> In responding to this RFI, please adhere to the areas of concentration and their numbering.

 6.  SECURING SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS:  Forms and other types of printed output produced by any computer system will be evaluated by the responsible staff member for data sensitivity.  Printed output containing sensitive data should be labeled as such, stored in locked cabinets or desks, and disposed of properly by shredding or placement in specially marked containers.  All employees are responsible for retrieving all printed outputs they request from printers or facsimile machines.  Data files, documentation, and other back-up materials will be stored in areas controlled by locks or personnel to prevent unauthorized access. 

Although all patient files are electronic, the contractor will receive various reports that require scanning.  After scanning of the documents, the following procedure shall be utilized at all times to ensure proper disposal of all patient data:

	(a) To ensure strict compliance with the VHA shredding and records disposal directive, the contractor shall provide shredders/lockboxes at the site.  If shredding is the final process utilized the contractor must meet National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for shredded material cut size.  However, if shredding is not the final destruction method but it is only an interim step in the destruction process, then shredding by NIST standards is not required.  However, the contractor must protect the shredded material until it is no longer readable or reconstructable, which means it must be pulverized, bleached, pulped or other means that fully destroys it and makes it unreadable.  If the contractor has a recycling vendor who performs any part of this process, the process of protecting this shredded material must be clearly specified - i.e. the material that is not shredded to NIST standards and is awaiting final recycle.  Also, specifying the means of recycling such as pulverizing, bleaching or pulping must all be clearly stated in any subcontract that the contractor may have for this service.  The contract shall state how such shredded materials (which are not in its final stage) will be protected until such time that the final recycle process is completed.  This information should be provided with the contractor's proposal.  The contractor shall protect and recycle in a manner that fully destroys the material.

         (b)  When a determination is made to dispose of any paper record containing PII or sensitive information, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) rules and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization will be followed. NARA's rules are not shredder specific, but the rules are nevertheless applicable, in particular where paper records are to be disposed. NIST 800-88 guidelines are shredder specific. (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).

         (c)  If shredding is chosen as the method of destruction, the following parameters will be applicable. The chosen shredder device must have a crosscutting capability which produces particles that are 1 X 5 millimeters in size or that will pulverize/disintegrate paper material using disintegrator devices with a 3/32 inch security screen.

Contractors may obtain current VA policy on shredders and destruction of temporary paper records at the following URL:  "Destruction of Temporary Paper Records", VA Directive 6371 http://vaww1.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=523&FType=2.  This directive establishes VA policy to ensure that Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive agency information contained in paper records is disposed of properly.  Shredders that are compliant with this directive are specified in the National Security Agency (NSA) Central Security Service (CSS) Evaluated Products List EPL-02-01-V http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/Government/MDG/NSA_CSS-EPL-02-01-AA.pdf .   All Administrations and Staff Offices should begin the process of eliminating non-compliant shredders and replacing them with shredders that are compliant with this directive.  

7. CONFIDENTIALITY OF PATIENT RECORDS:
The contractor understands and agrees that the information in the medical records of all patients is confidential.  Strict confidentiality is to be maintained.  Rules of Confidentiality expected to be conformed with are delineated in 38 U.S.C. 3301, 38 U.S.C. 4132, 5 U.S.C. 552 (1) et. Seq.

The contractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements.  VA directives are available on the VA directives Web site at http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/   

All contractors and subcontractors working with VA Sensitive Information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of regular VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.  The level of background security investigation will be in accordance with VA Directive 0710, Handbook 0710, which are available at:  http://www1.va.gov/vapubs/  and VHA Directive 0710 and implementing Handbook 0710.01 which are available at: 
http://www1.va.gov/vhapublications/ViewPublication.asp?pub_ID=1569
Contractors are responsible for screening their employees.  

"	Contract personnel with limited and intermittent access to equipment connected to facility networks on which limited VA sensitive information may reside, including medical equipment contractors who install, maintain, and repair networked medical equipment such as CT scanners, EKG systems, ICU monitoring, etc.  In this case, Veterans Health Administration facilities must have a duly executed VA business associate agreement (BAA) in place with the vendor in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associates, to assure compliance with the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in addition to the contract.  Contract personnel, if on site, should be escorted by VA IT staff.

Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.  National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry safeguards the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts.  Defense Security Service (DSS) administers the NISP on behalf of the Department of Defense and 23 other federal agencies within the Executive Branch.  VA will verify clearance through DSS.

Contractor(s) shall insure the confidentiality of all patient and employee information and shall be held liable in the event of breach of confidentiality according to federal regulations contained in HIPPA and any other applicable law,

However, like other components of the Department, and not withstanding any other provisions of the contract, the Contractor is restricted from making disclosures of VA records, or information contained in such records, to which it may have access, except to the extent that explicit disclosure authority from VA has been received.  The Contractor is subject to the same penalties and liabilities for unauthorized disclosures of such records as VA.

The records referred to above shall be and remain the property of VA and shall not be removed or transferred from VA except in accordance with U.S.C.551a (Privacy Act), 38 U.S.C. 5701 (Confidentiality of claimants records), 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), 38 U.S.C. 5705 (Confidentiality of Medical Quality Assurance Records) 38 U.S.C. 7332 (Confidentiality of certain medical records) and federal laws, rules and regulations.

As such, the Contractor is considered Part of the Department health activity for purposes of the following statutes and the VA regulations implementing these statutes: The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552A AND 38 U.S.C. sections 5701, 7705, and 7332.  Contractor and its employees may have access to the VA patient medical records to the extent necessary for the contractor to perform the contract, notwithstanding patient treatment records only pursuant to explicit disclosure authority from VA.

<DESC>The following notice is a Sources Sought in accordance with FAR 5.201(c). This is an information gathering stage of the Market Research process.  The Government is attempting to find prospective businesses (Large, or Small Firms) who may be interested in competing for a Firm Fixed Price service contract with a base twelve month period of performance, and three one-year option periods to investigate technology and methodology for specific enrichment, library preparation and subsequent detection of low copy number pathogen and vector targets.  This technology involves a nucleic acid template detection assay called Heterologus Elongation Ligation Reaction and Sequencing (HELSR) which combines a unique library preparation technology with detection capabilities.  Specific hybridization probes are designed that are compatible with the HELSR assay.  If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then the competition will be conducted as a small business set-aside.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, VA Northern Indiana Health Care System - Fort Wayne Campus.  Transaction#:  610-14-1-082-0001

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:   Purchase of blood and blood products as well as performance of specialized transfusion service testing such as antibody identification, unit antigen typing, and other complex test procedures not performed by the VA Northern Indiana Health Care System laboratory.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Blood and blood products will be requested and purchased on an as-needed basis dependent upon the clinical needs of our patients. Complex testing will be requested when necessary to support the need for blood and blood products and is required in order to obtain compatible product.  Blood, Blood products and reference lab services must be available to the VANIHCS in a timely manner to support the needs of our patients.

3.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

4.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
The American Red Cross (ARC) - Indiana Ohio Region Blood Services is the only blood/blood product distribution service within a reasonable distance to the VANIHCS that can provide products on an as needed basis in a timely manner ranging from routine requests (1-2 days) to STAT requests (1-2 hours).  Additionally, the ARC has reference lab services on site to provide non-routine testing of complex patient samples 24/7.  They are able to screen units for complex patients and provide suitable blood products for transfusion to the VANIHCS in a timely manner to support patient care.  	
 


5.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Locations of other blood suppliers was investigated and this contractor was the only one identified that was capable of providing the STAT services within the required time frames due to the physical location of the distribution center.  The only other blood distribution center and transfusion service reference lab identified had a distance of 84 miles per Mapquest.

6.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  American Red Cross pricing is reasonable based on comparison with other blood suppliers.  Additionally, they support a transfer program that allows us to recover costs on products that potentially would not be used by transferring them to an alternate facility before they expire.

7.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted to determine if any other blood distribution centers would be able to meet the needs of our facility, in particular the time constraints required for STAT testing and STAT provision of blood and blood products.  No other blood distribution facilities were identified that could meet these requirements due to their physical locations.

8.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The American Red Cross is a nationally known and respected supplier of blood and blood products.  They comply with all federal and state regulations related to the procurement, processing and distribution of blood and blood products.  They comply with all regulatory requirements related to reference lab services for the scope of testing offered. 

9.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

10.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: 
None.

11.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>Synopsis:<br />Request for Information (RFI): Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) Cockpit Upgrade</p>
<p>1.0 - SUMMARY:<br />1.1 - The Government has a requirement for the sustainment, modernization and enhancement of the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) avionics cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2 - To fulfill this requirement, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), is investigating alternative acquisition approaches, identifying the feasibility and practicality of each in order to select the most favorable course of action. One alternative under consideration is a hardware and software, "total avionics cockpit", solution. To that end, the Government is seeking interested industry organizations that can furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materiel necessary to develop an integrated avionics system cockpit for the A/MH-6 platform with the potential for follow-on avionics systems life-cycle sustainment and support thru 2030. Additionally, as a follow-up to receipt of RFI responses, a Market Research Interchange Meeting (MRIM) may be held for this requirement, tentatively scheduled for 12/03/13. The Industry Day date to be finalized and location will be released on/about 11/04/13.</p>
<p>1.3 - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI.

<p>2.0 - BACKGROUND:<br />2.1 - Since the baseline A/MH-6M began fielding in November 2003, the MELB Program Management Office (PMO) has conducted a series of modification (preplanned and unplanned) programs to keep the aircraft updated with customer requirements and modernized mission equipment. The preplanned Block 3.0 configuration is the continuation of a block upgrade strategy designed to extend the service life of the A/MH-6M while long-term alternatives for aircraft replacement are analyzed. Part of the Block 3.0 program includes a digital cockpit upgrade for a digital moving map (DigMap), battle field networking, and interfaces for rapid insertion planned technology upgrades.<br />2.2 - Weight discipline is a critical element of this program. The end state of the Block 3.0 modification is successful implementation of the identified level of engineering, performance, and cognizance without increasing the basic empty weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 - DESCRIPTION OF NEED: Objectives for the MELB Block 3.0 Cockpit Avionics Integration Program and vendor capabilities/qualifications include:</p>
<p>3.1 - Cockpit Avionics Functionality: The following provides a high-level list of the required MELB Block 3.0 system avionics capabilities:<br />3.1.1 - Avionics System Management/Data Load/Maintenance <br />3.1.2 - Aircraft Systems State Display<br />3.1.3 - Navigation <br />3.1.4 - Flight Management <br />3.1.5 - Communications Management <br />3.1.5.1 - Two-channel data-capable radio in conjunction with existing communications equipment (see Section 3.3 - Hardware below).<br />3.1.6 - Weapons Management <br />3.1.7 - Mission Sensor Management <br />3.1.8 - Tactical Situation Management</p>
<p>3.2 - Avionics Systems Integration:<br />3.2.1 - Interested parties should consider solutions that provide existing and desired capabilities including the functionality stated above and that follow the guidance below regarding hardware components with Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) considerations.<br />3.2.2 - Interface. Any proposed integrated avionics cockpit will be required to interface with a multitude of onboard systems and have the ability to easily integrate new aircraft systems. Integration of cockpit avionics into the aircraft will be performed by a third party vendor. Coordination with this third party will be necessary for full platform integration considerations such as installation, weight, power, cooling, data, and data interface requirements.<br />3.2.3 - A current and notional console layout is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).<br />3.3 - Hardware:<br />3.3.1 - Overall considerations for hardware includes:<br />3.3.1.1 - Cube. Space is extremely limited in the A/MH-6 series of aircraft for cockpit displays, cabin Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and wire runs. In general, available space for avionics includes areas behind and beneath the consoles, area directly forward of the center console, under the pilot/copilot floorboards, and avionics racks behind the pilot seats (Diagrams with approximate dimensions are available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).)<br />3.3.1.2 - Weight. As previously mentioned, weight is a critical element of this program. The weight of the cockpit trade space is estimated to be 120 pounds. (additional information regarding candidate core avionics components for removal/replacement is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).) This weight value is only an estimate to be used for preliminary planning. <br />3.3.1.3 - Power. The A/MH-6 cockpit must operate on 28VDC power. The aircraft does not contain an AC generator. Additionally, aircraft start must be performed on battery power. As a result, critical aircraft state information must be displayed during the start sequence.<br />3.3.1.4 - Environment. The A/MH-6 cockpit will be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as sand, dirt, debris, and moisture due to frequent open cockpit operations.<br />3.3.1.5 - Night Operation. The A/MH-6 cockpit must be compatible with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.<br />3.3.1.6 - The avionics system equipment will be of the manufacturer's current design (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 7 or higher desired), military and/or civil qualified, and capable of performing its intended function in accordance with the operation and performance requirements specified herein. <br />3.3.2 - Upon request, a list of some of the avionics LRUs planned to be retained as a part of the aircraft configuration may be provided (reference paragraph 3.7). These LRUs, including Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF), radios, Tactical Airborne Navigation (TACAN), Air Data Computer (ADC), and Radar Altimeter, must integrate with any proposed cockpit design.<br />3.3.3 - Mission-specific equipment and functionality, such as Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), may also be integrated into this platform as a part of the cockpit avionics integration effort. The Government's primary intent for this RFI is the investigation of candidate cockpit solutions with a focus on reduction in weight attributed to core equipment.</p>

<DESC>The essence of this arrangement is that a contractor will be awarded a SPQ and will provide the subject NSN to satisfy the requirements for the SOP direct delivery program.  Orders are expected to ship to any location within the continental US.  Note that orders that are expected to be shipped to an ultimate destination overseas will be first shipped to a distribution center in the US by the awarded vendor.  The period of the SPQ will not exceed a one year time frame.  There is no guarantee of orders and the SPQ can be cancelled at any time. Previous provider for subject NSN and previous price are attached.  The Government will make award to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the request for quote will be most advantageous to the Government. 

Award evaluation factors include Price and days after receipt of order (DARO) to ship the direct delivery orders. Award will be made to the low priced quote who quotes an acceptable shipment time frame of 30 days or less to ship.  The average of the three prices based upon the price break quantities specified (1, 2-9, 10+) will be utilized to evaluate low price.  By signing the 1449 signature document contractor verifies that the item they are quoting meets the Item Purchase Description as well as any applicable clauses.

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

<p>This Request for Proposal solicits offers from industry to provide a Common Data Link (CDL) system for communication of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Command/Control (C2) data for Group 2-3 Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) platforms.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Recent enhancements to the Common Data Link could lead to significant growth in the portfolio of CDL platforms through integration of the mandated, standardized and interoperable CDL communications capability into smaller UAS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Greater flexibility in data rates, frequency bands, and improved spectral efficiency offer the opportunity to expand the use of CDL into Group 1-3 UAS platforms, for example, the Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) currently under development for the Navy and Marine Corps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CDL employment was previously precluded for use in many of these UAS groups due to the limited Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) budgets of the platforms.</span></p>

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Sierra Nevada Corporation operating in Sparks, NV. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541330.

<DESC>The proposed source is Kodak or one of their resellers with a GSA Schedule. Kodak product support is the only maintenance support that can satisfy the Government's requirements and uniquely meet the Government's requirements in terms of image quality, image processing, and the capability to output simultaneously a bitonal TIFF and Color PDF version of DTIC's technical reports. DTIC procured two (2) Kodak i640 scanners; one in 2004 and the other in 2006 that require annual maintenance. These scanners are critical for DTIC to convert paper technical reports to image files to satisfy the requirements for DoD's Technical Report (TR) Database.

<DESC>Mindjet MindManager software is used to develop new business process maps, in addition to, organizing the responsibilities of individual divisions. This product will assist in developing the work breakdown structure of each division assigning their personnel into each area of responsibility. Additionally, this product has cleared all Information Assurance and Enterprise Network reviews and will be immediately useable once procured. Therefore, any cost savings that might be obtained through the procurement of other software would be countered by the cost to certify new software through the IA and Enterprise Network review process.

<p>Not purchasing this support would jeopardize the integrity and maintenance of this proprietary TRIM system and hinder the processing, approval, publication, and distribution of these documents DoD requesters. Extensive market research validated that HP can only satisfy the specifications/capabilities. HP has not authorized ANY of its resellers to offer HP Maintenance renewals on a partner held GSA Schedule. Any reseller that is offering Maintenance Renewal Pricing (to be delivered by HP directly) off of their own GSA Schedule, would be violating their Reseller Agreement with HP.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District has a requirement for two (2) multibeam sonar systems with the following capabilities: (1) capable of self-tuning and automatically adjusting all the sonar settings for optimal performance in any given environment; (2) provides visual displays that indicate the quality of data being collected to ensure survey accuracy and minimize post-processing editing time; (3) performs a self diagnostic test which summarizes the overall condition of the system; (4) displays real-time imagery, in the user interface, with adequate resolution and on-screen history to aid in search, location, identification, and recovery applications; (5) capable of maintaining IHO accuracy within the full swath by producing enough beams to ensure equidistant and equiangular spacing; (6) capable of electronic beam steering of swath to aid in surveying channel banks and structures; and (7) capable of forming a steerable high density swath sector within a wider low density swath sector to aid in pipeline crossing/tracking surveys. The Reson SeaBat 7125-SV2 is the only multibeam sonar system able to meet the above capabilities.
