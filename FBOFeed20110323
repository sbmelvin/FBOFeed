<p>Electronic submission to Michelle.Grieco@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which Criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than Criteria (1) through (3), will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology which will include the layout, soundness and clarity of the technical plan, clearly outlined scope, metrics used to evaluate success and how it will improve upon current state-of-the-art technology developments, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Application &amp; Maturity of Approach - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness and how well it fits tactical audio, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees to the extent appropriate. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html .</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia-Cascade Area Office, Yakima WA will be issuing an RFQ (R11PS1C210) for the following services involoving fish entrainment on or about March 28, 2011.  Firms with the capabilities to perform this job are required to provide a qualification statement with their proposal. Contractor Qualifications:To qualify for award, prospective contractors must be able to show that they have experience in maintaining and operating rotary screw traps and have performed similar studies in rivers with rapidly changing flow rates.  Contractors must also have experience in identifying and handling bull trout populations in the Pacific Northwest. 
Information and interest requests can be sent to:Bureau of Reclamation Connie Morgan, Purchasing Agent1917 Marsh RoadYakima WA 98901or electronically to cmorgan@usbr.gov....no faxes pleaseThe Statement of Work for this service is as follows:Purpose for Cost Estimate Request:The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is proposing to conduct a fish entrainment study at its Kachess Dam facility located near the town of Easton in central Washington State.  For this study, a single rotary screw trap (RST) and split-beam hydroacoustic array will be operated for a 5-month period at the outlet of Kachess Dam between May 16th, 2011 and October 14th, 2011.  Reclamation is seeking qualified Fisheries Consultants to provide field data collection and technical oversight for field data collection activities for this sampling effort.
A Scope of Work outlining the required work tasks and project deliverables to be included in the cost estimate is provided below.
Background:Fish entrainment, defined as fish movement out of storage reservoirs and into downstream waterbodies, is known to occur at Reclamation operated storage dams in the Yakima River Basin.  Outlet structures for the five Yakima Project storage dams are not screened to prevent fish entrainment when water releases are made at these facilities.  Past fish entrainment investigations by Reclamation at Tieton Dam (a Yakima Project storage facility on the Tieton River) have shown that the amount of fish entrainment can be substantial during period when high flows are released.  Furthermore, studies at Tieton Dam have also shown that a variety of highly valued species are being entrained, including bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) which is a listed species under the Endangered Species Act.
Although fish entrainment is likely occurring at other Yakima Project storage dams, the extent or magnitude of fish entrainment is not well known and estimates of total fish entrainment as well as the composition of species being entrained at these facilities has become a matter of speculation.  Current estimates of entrainment at these facilities is based on the rates of entrainment obtained from the study at Tieton Dam.  However, the outlet work configuration and water release patterns at other Yakima Project storage dams are different than those at Tieton Dam.  As a result, entrainment rates for other Yakima Project reservoirs may not be similar to those reported for Tieton Dam which may lead to inaccurate assumptions about entrainment rates at other reservoirs.  Because listed bull trout populations exist in the upper Yakima River basin, and Reclamation operations may affect this species, Reclamation would like to investigate the amount, timing, and composition of species being entrained at other Reclamation storage dams in the Yakima basin. Reclamation is proposing to investigate the total amount of fish entrainment, including the rate and timing of entrainment, as well as the species composition of fish being entrained at Kachess Dam on the Upper Yakima River. Timing of the proposed entrainment study would encompass the period when the majority of the summer high flows are released from Kachess Dam.  This time period would be approximately 5-months in duration and would occur from approximately May 16th, 2011 to October 14th, 2011.  This time period encompasses the rising limb, peak flow, and rescinding limb of the hydrograph at Kachess Dam as well as the period with the highest and lowest annual water surface elevations in Kachess Reservoir (see Figure 1 below). Reclamation Responsibilities:Reclamation personnel will be responsible for overall project oversight for this study.  Reclamation will also ensure that the rotary screw trap (RST) equipment and associated installation materials are acquired and within satisfactory working order before the start of the sampling period.  Furthermore, Reclamation personnel will oversee delivery of the RST to the work site, and assist with the installation and anchoring of the RST at the eventual location of trap operation (after consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)).  Reclamation will provide an electric hook-up to power the hydroacoustic array.
Reclamation will also be responsible for obtaining scientific collectors permits from both the FWS and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for the capture and handling of fish, including ESA listed bull trout prior to the initiation of field sampling.  Finally, Reclamation will be responsible for completing initial written drafts of project results, soliciting review and comments of draft documents, and preparation of the final report for the entrainment monitoring study. 

Physical Facilities at Kachess Dam and Equipment Proposed for Fish Sampling:Kachess Dam is located near the town of Easton, in central Washington State (Kittitas County).  It is approximately 70 miles southeast of Seattle, WA and is 75 miles northwest of the city of Yakima, WA along Interstate-90 near Snoqualmie Pass (See Vicinity Map, Figure 2)).
The outlet works of Kachess Dam emerge from a gated penstock and water released from the dam flows through a straight outlet channel that is concrete-lined for a short distance and then lined with rip-rap bank armoring before flowing into a more natural vegetated stream channel downstream of the dam.  Figures 3 - 6 show the outlet channel configuration where the rotary screw trap will likely be located during the entrainment study field sampling.As part of this field sampling work the selected contractor will have access to Reclamation owned facilities at the Kachess Dam work location.  The Kachess Dam site has facilities available for fish processing and a restroom that will be available for contractor use.  Note: because this facility is a secure site, all personnel employed by the selected contractor for use on this project will be required to undergo a Reclamation background security check prior to being allowed on site and before they are issued Reclamation gate keys to this facility.
As discussed above, the rotary screw trap (RST) that will be used for this fish monitoring effort will be delivered and installed on site by Reclamation.  The RST that Reclamation has acquired for sampling has an 8-ft diameter drum and has been modified by removing the aluminum center shaft which was replaced with a stainless steel center shaft to reduce wear and to provide for extended life over long periods of use.  Contractor Responsibilities and Tasks:
General Sampling SchemeReclamation envisions that the fisheries sampling will occur over a 5-month duration between May 16th and October 14th, 2011.  Hydroacoustic monitoring should provide 24-hour coverage. The rotary screw trap (RST) will need to be checked for proper operation and processing of fish catches at a minimum frequency of once per day, 3-times per week while the trap is in operation.  Frequency of RST checks will depend on requirements of permitting agencies, debris load (which should be minimal) and amount of fish being caught (which also is expected to be minimal) and may need to be increased if observed fish capture or debris loading is higher than expected.  In order to meet budget requirements, the RST may not be operated over the entire 5-month sampling season.  Proposals should include several options of varying sample effort of the RST, both in terms of duration of screw trap operation and frequency of screw trap checks.     
Provided below are the required tasks expected to be completed by the Fisheries Contractor and the project deliverables for this work.

Task 1:  Project Administration, RST and hydroacoustic array installation, and Field Technician Set-upThe contractor will determine the most effective installation and anchoring set up for the RST and work with a Reclamation crew to install and anchor the RST.  The contractor will be responsible for installing the hydroacoustic array and providing a secure storage space for computer and hydroacoustic data storage equipment near the RST sampling equipment.
The selected contractor will be responsible for the hiring and training of qualified field leaders and field technicians.  For this project Reclamation will require a minimum of 2 field technicians who will be responsible for maintaining, operating, and data recording for the duration of the sampling effort.  The contractor will need to provide qualified technicians that are capable of reliably working under typical field sampling conditions and who can accurately identify and carry out the required fish reporting duties for this effort.  It is critical that the technicians are able to accurately identify fish to species, especially threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus).  Field technicians must be able to take all required measurements of fish captured, take detailed notes, and must be able to release fish alive and unharmed when appropriate.  Field technicians must also be able to collect genetic samples and follow a detailed protocol on fish handling when dealing with any bull trout samples that are collected.
A trained and senior fisheries biologist should be available to provide on site technician training and coordination and to ensure that fish sampling will occur according to schedule and according to specifications for this project.   
Note: As discussed above, all personnel that are selected for work on this project, including field technicians and field leaders, must have a Reclamation background security check prior to being allowed on site at this secure Reclamation facility.  Reclamation will provide the selected contractor with the appropriate paperwork for submission to Reclamation.  Reclamation will also cover the cost of the background checks.

Task 2:  Monitoring of Screw TrapsThe selected contractor will provide 2 field technicians to maintain and operate the RST for a minimum of 48 total work days over approximately 5 months: May 16th - October 14th, 2011.  The sampling schedule will require a minimum of one check per day, 3 days per week while the RST is in operation (Monday through Friday).  Fish capture rates or debris loading that is higher than expected may necessitate more frequent trap checks. In order to meet budget requirements, the RST may not be operated over the entire 5-month sampling season.  Proposals should include several options of varying sample effort of the RST, both in terms of duration of screw trap operation and frequency of screw trap checks.     
A field check of the equipment will consist of checking the RST to ensure that it is operating properly (rotating at proper speeds and fishing according to trap design) and to remove any debris as well as cleaning the drum at each visit.  A field check will also consist of checking the RST livewell for fish.  Any fish captured will be removed from the livewell, processed according to conventional fish measurements including; identification of all fish to species, enumeration of all fish by species, and measurement of fish length and condition of all fish captured.  The contractor will record all information on standardized data forms that will be provided by the contractor.
Any bull trout captured will be sampled using a defined protocol which will involve anesthetizing, measuring, photographing, collecting a genetic sample, and releasing live fish back to Kachess Reservoir according to specifications of the scientific collectors permit for the project.  Reclamation will provide the contractor with genetic testing kits and will train the contractor provided technicians on the field protocol required for bull trout samples that are collected.  
Task 3:  Trap Efficiency TestingThe contractor will be responsible for performing several RST capture efficiency estimates over the duration of the entrainment sampling.
Efficiency estimates are periodically required to determine the proportion of fish that are effectively being sampled by the RST.  Efficiency estimates will be used to extrapolate the total number of fish being entrained at the dam based on the number of fish actually captured by the RST.  Multiple efficiency estimates will need to be made to determine the relationship of capture efficiency with flow rates out of the dam.
For this project, a minimum of 10 efficiency estimates will be required.  These should occur approximately every two weeks of sampling.  This schedule should result in an accurate representation of trap capture efficiency over a wide range of flows at the dam.
The contractor should plan on using equal numbers of both live and dead fish for each capture efficiency test.  These fish will primarily be obtained from the livewell of the RST and should consist of the predominant species being entrained out of the dam which most likely will be kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka).  Live fish should be held in aerated holding tanks that are sufficient to keep the fish healthy until time of release for each efficiency test.  The contractor will provide tanks for holding the fish and will be required to mark the fish by any non-lethal means of the contractor's choosing (e.g. simple identifiable fin clip, dye marks, etc.).  During trap capture efficiency testing, marked fish (both live and dead) should be released at the farthest upstream extent of the outlet works at Kachess Dam to allow for adequate dispersal in the channel prior to encountering the RST.
The contractor may use hatchery fish for conducting efficiency estimates if and when available.  The WDFW will be stocking hatchery kokanee into Kachess Reservoir during the months of May and June.  These kokanee may serve as adequate surrogates for fish that are likely to be entrained at the dam.  The contractor can work with both Reclamation and the WDFW to obtain hatchery fish for these efficiency tests if they are available.
Task 4:  Hydroacoustic Monitoring 
The contractor must reliably collect continuous daily 24-hour/day 7-days/week hydroacoustic data at the outlet channel of Kachess Dam at a variety of streamflows expected to occur during the period of study (expected streamflows are in the range of 200 to 1200 cfs).  Hydroacoustic data should be collected during the entire 5 month monitoring period from May 16th, 2011 to October 14th, 2011.
The data must be analyzed to provide summaries of daily total entrainment over the study period (broken down by species when compared to fish composition data caught in the RST), entrainment occurring over an average 24-hour diel period (broken down into 2 hour intervals), and total fish entrainment over the entire study period by species, with variability and confidence estimates.

Task 5:  DeliverablesThe contractor will be required to produce a brief technical memorandum for delivery to Reclamation which outlines the methods used for RST maintenance, protocols for sampling the RST, and methods used for efficiency testing.  The technical memorandum will also describe any unusual events that occurred during the sample collection period, including periods when the trap was not functioning properly and any unusual or uncertain occurrences concerning fish identification. 
The contractor will also deliver a copy of all data sheets used for recording daily catch data for the RST as well as data sheets for all efficiency estimate tests conducted during the study period.  Also, the contractor will deliver copies of all data sheets, photographs, and genetic samples collected from any bull trout captured during the sampling period. 
The contractor will provide all hydroacoustic summary data in hard copy and electronic form (CD storage) and will provide a write-up of the hydroacoustic methods used and results obtained from hydroacoustic data obtained from this project.  The write-up will be included as an appendix and be suitable for incorporation into Reclamation's final report for this project.  In addition the contractor will archive all hydroacoustic data collected during the study period and provide such data to Reclamation in an electronic format that is suitable for further analysis if Reclamation chooses to perform additional data analysis.

Contractor Qualifications:To qualify for submitting cost estimates for this scope of work, prospective contractors must be able to show that they have experience in maintaining and operating rotary screw traps and have performed similar studies in rivers with rapidly changing flow rates.  Contractors must also have experience in identifying and handling bull trout populations in the Pacific Northwest.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Education Division has a requirement to provide preschool classrooms with materials that support intentional teaching and purposeful learning of the DoDEA Science Content Standards within a problem-based, project-oriented environment using a Firm-Fixed-Price contract on a sole source basis with Teaching Strategies,7101 Wisconsin Avenue Suite 700, Bethesda Maryland 20814, under the authority of FAR 6.302. DoDEA has a requirement to provide all prekindergarten (PK) students with a quality integrated science program that is consistent with the PK curriculum and assessment system currently utilized in its classrooms. Currently, DoDEA uses Creative Curriculum&reg; for Preschool, and its associated digital assessment system, Creative Curriculum.net. The updated Creative Curriculum&reg; for Preschool, Creative Curriculum&reg; System 5 for Preschool, is a research-based system that uses the studies approach as a method of integrating content learning through children's in-depth investigation of meaningful topics. The program focuses on science and social studies topics while promoting skills in language and literacy, mathematics, technology, and the arts. Teaching Strategies is the sole provider for Creative Curriculum. In order to have consistency in curriculum, instruction, and assessment, the PK integrated science materials must align directly with the current curriculum framework and assessment system utilized in DoDEA preschool classrooms. DoDEA PK classrooms are designed and supported by the Creative Curriculum&reg; framework. Further, Creative Curriculum.net is the assessment system used in DoDEA PK Classrooms. This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, any party that believes it is capable of meeting DoDEA's requirement as stated herein may submit a written capability statement that clearly supports and demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement. All submissions must be received by the response date and time of this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5. The Department of Defense requires all contractors to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to receive any contract award or payment. The CCR website is:http://www.ccr.gov. All comments and questions regarding the solicitation/RFP shall be submitted in writing and sent to the following e-mail address: Hector.vega@hq.dodea.edu

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES FOR INSPECTORS TRAINING.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611519, Other Technical and Trade Schools. Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify
    a.  Type of services provided by your firm 
    b.  Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance) 
    c.  Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned, and 8(a) certified businesses.
Attached is a draft performance work statement.  Respondents are encouraged to review the performance work statement and provide comments.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source bases with the University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Dr., UIHC, Iowa City, IA 52242 for laboratory testing for GBV-C Infection &amp; Risk of the NHL in the PLCO Cohort.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $12M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award with one twelve month option period.</p>
<p>To investigate the association between GB virus C (GBV-C) and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), NCI investigators are conducting a nested case-control study of GBV-C and NHL in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) study population. The purpose of the procurement is to provide laboratory testing for GBV-C to support NCI's case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study has three aims: 1) to evaluate whether the prevalence of active GBV-C infection, as indicated by detection of circulating RNA, is greater in cases compared to controls; 2) to evaluate persistence of GBV-C infection in cases and controls; and 3) to evaluate whether the prevalence of past GBV-C infection, as indicated by the detection of GBV-C antibody, is greater in cases than in controls.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform: 1) GBV-C RNA testing in serum samples using RT-PCR; 2) E2 antibody testing in serum samples using ELISA; and 3) HCV and HIV antibody testing in serum samples using ELISA.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of an approved or commercial test for GBV-C RNA and E2 antibody, it is necessary for NCI to purchase testing from a research laboratory. The Stapleton laboratory at the University of Iowa has developed and optimized RT-PCR methods for GB virus type C, as well as an antibody capture ELISA method based on a recombinant GBV-C E2 protein expression system. Since 1999, this laboratory has tested more than 8,000 samples from 18 cohorts including several large multicenter study groups. No other known laboratory has developed and validated GBV-C tests.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 6, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, atwardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-110049-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Xenotransplant section of the Cardiac Surgery Branch, intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis for the purchase of Transgenic Services.</p>
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-128-DDC.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Xenotransplant section of the Cardiac Surgery Branch of NHLBI is involved in the development of pigs that some day may provide transplant organs that can be used in humans. Transgenic pigs are needed for the study of how these transplanted organs might be rejected in humans. In normal animals, various sugars are produced by the body and these sugars are attached to its organs. Each of these sugars has a role in the organ rejection process. These transgenic pigs do not produce certain types of these sugars and therefore their organs are not rejected as quickly. If each of these sugars can be identified and removed from transplant organs, we may one day have an unlimited supply for people who need transplants.</p>
<p>Statement of Work:<br />Contractor task:<br />The contractor is required to provide healthy transgenic pigs for the xeno-transplant program for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The animals produced need to be of the genetic lines GTKO/CD46, GTKO/CD46/DAF, GTKO/CD46/TM, or GTKO/CD46/CD39. The contractor is expected to deliver twelve animals per year.</p>
<p>Health Status of Animals: Animals will be from a SPF (specific pathogen free) herd and shall not exhibit any signs of current or past illness. <br />&bull; Animals will be screened for their suitability as heart donors via cardiac ultrasound.<br />&bull; Animals will be shipped with a state health certificate.<br />&bull; Any abnormal animals that are detected will be rejected at the time of delivery. <br />&bull; Weights of piglet will vary from 10 - 20 Kg. They will be shipped at the appropriate weight to match the organ recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transportation: <br />Deliveries will occur approximately monthly. The vendor shall be no more than seven hours driving distance away from the NIH main campus or Poolesville quarantine facility. Vehicles used to transport shall be appropriate for the species and weather conditions. Transportation costs shall be included in the price of the transgenic services. <br />Deliveries: Deliveries shall be made on Monday - Friday between 8am and 3pm to:<br />Animals shall be delivered one or two at a time.</p>
<p>National Institutes of Health<br />14 Service Rd. West<br /><br />Bldg. 14E, Rm. 106B <br />Bethesda, Md. 20892</p>
<p>Delivery is not authorized on Government holidays; arrangements will be made for the next business day.</p>
<p>Period of performance is for one year after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that Revivicor Incorporated is currently the only vendor in the United States that can produce the required genetic lines. These pigs shall be shipped at three to four weeks of age and the relatively close proximity (6 hours) to NIH minimizes the stress that these very young pigs must endure during shipping. Young animals are subject to shipping fever (a respiratory infection) and the chances of infection increases with the level of stress. Any animals that become sick after reaching NIH cannot be used for transplant because of their rapid growth rate. Any pigs that have to be medicated would be too large by the time they were well. Revivicor also has a close relationship with the Virginia Tech Veterinary School. Their pigs are checked by veterinary cardiologists before shipment. This ensures that these animals are excellent candidates for organ donation prior to shipping to NIH.</p>
<p>The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-50 (March 16, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by March 27, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>NSWC Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Advance Machine & Laser, 1010 Aberdeen Loop, Panama City, FL 32405-6417 on a sole-source basis for the fabrication of items needed to complete the Phoenix program.  They have specialized equipment needed to manufacture these engine components.  Advanced Machine and Laser has machined the engine components for the Non-gasoline Burning Outboard Engine (NBOE) that NSWC PCD engineers have been testing for the past 2 years.  They have the expertise to produce the Mod 0 engine, which is an advanced version of the NBOE.  Advance Machine and Laser LLC already has many of the required numeric controlled (NC) machine code for the original versions of the required parts on file.
  This will significantly reduce the time and cost needed to produce the engine parts, as it will take substantially less time to make the changes to the existing NC machine code than it would for any other company to produce these parts from "scratch".  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a sole source contract to Creare Incorporated, 16 Great Hollow Road, Hanover, NH 03755 for the acquisition of engineering services and operational testing of the test cell and touchless droplet dispenser system of the Chemical Biological Agent Resistance Test (CBART) program.   Verification testing inevitably leads to troubleshooting and modifications to correct unexpected deficiencies to bring the system into specification.  Contractor support is required to conduct operational & verification testing to determine the CBART capabilities, shortcomings, anomalies, errors, and remedies.  Creare Incorporated is the only company that can provide this support for the following reasons.
   This is a follow-on contract for the acquisition of specialized engineering services for continued development of the CBART test cell, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of another vendor other than Creare, would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The CBART test cell, test method, and equipment for assessing the penetration resistance of protective garments against chemical agents was developed by Creare.  Creare Incorporated is the only company familiar with the methodology to conduct material swatch testing using chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals, toxic industrial materials and the design, fabrication & operation of the CBART prototype cell in order to provide appropriate analysis and support.
  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The MELCOR computer program has historically been used for performance of deterministic light-water reactor severe accident analysis. Recently, MELCOR has been used for a number of other purposes including high-temperature gas reactor analysis, spent fuel pool analysis, and light-water reactor design-basis confirmatory analysis. In addition, MELCOR has recently been employed for probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) success criteria analysis, both at the NRC and elsewhere. An example of this usage is NUREG-1953, "Confirmatory Thermal-Hydraulic Analysis to Support Specific Success Criteria in the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk Models - Surry and Peach Bottom."
<p>The objective of this contract is to obtain contractor technical assistance in: 1) Existing Model Upgrade and Maintenance and New Model Development, 2) Quick-Turn-Around Calculations to Support Emergent Issues, 3) Investigation of Underlying Modeling Assumptions, 4) Support for Comparative Analysis with the Modular Accident Analysis Package, 5) Scoping of Success Criteria Issues for a New Site Level 3 PRA and 6) Technical Assistance and Draft NUREG/CR Development.</p>
<p>The performance period will be from day of award (estimated June 2011) through two years.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about April 15, 2011 and the closing date for proposals will be 30 days from the date the full solicitation gets posted. The solicitation will be available solely through the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, therefore, interested parties are requested not to send letters, e-mails or faxes requesting copies of the RFP. Accordingly, telephoned, mailed, e-mailed or faxed requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any costs associated with responding to this solicitation.</p>
<p>The size standard for this acquisition is set forth under NAICS code 541330.</p>
<p>Proposals for this requirement are 100% small business set aside.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, interested parties MUST be registered with the Central Contractor Registry at www.ccr.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Please see attached: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)), Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Holohil Systems Ltd. We have a requirement for 197 (137 - 1.8g BD-2 and 60 - 0.51g BD-2N) radio transmitters.  These transmitters will be placed on the federally endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus).  With these transmitters we will be able to track both sub-adult and adult toads. These BD-2 transmitters are necessary to fulfill the Animal Care and Use Committees request to use a transmitter that is <10% of the toads body mass.  These toads will be tracked for up to 1 year requiring transmitters with the longest lasting batteries.  From previous projects we currently have 27 BD-2 transmitters that require refurbishing.  Refurbishing these transmitters is much less expensive than purchasing new ones.  Holohil System Ltd. is the only vendor that will refurbish these BD-2 transmitters.  To resolve any compatibility issues between the transmitters and the receivers, we will want to use only Holohil transmitters for the additional new transmitters that need to be purchased.  Holohil specializes in the design and production of the smallest and lightest transmitters currently available.We will also need to have the option for possible procurement of the following items: We will be purchasing the 60 BD-2N transmitters above; therefore we may need to have 30 BD-2N transmitters refurbished at four different times to get us through mid-November for a total of 120 refurbished transmitters. Also, we may need to have 60 BD-2 transmitters refurbished at two different times for a total of 120 refurbished transmitters.NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USGS requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Agency (FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii)). All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Zachary Buss, at zbuss@usgs.gov. This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-50, Effective 16 March 2011.In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(13)(i), One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334290 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing).

Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541370. *** Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers Districts. Contract limits and contract size will be determined at the time of selection.

Task Orders will be for topographic survey, boundary surveys, hydrographic surveys, and digital aerial mapping and photography for construction projects throughout the Savannah District and SAD. These task orders are firm fixed price. *** Work will be issued by negotiated, firm-fixed price or labor-hour task orders. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. *** This announcement is open to all businesses. Small businesses are encouraged to team with other businesses. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 330, Section C, by identifying subcontracting opportunities with small business. Award of the contract is anticipated in approximately January 2012. If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with F AR 52.219-9 and DFARS 219.7704/705 as part of the Request for Proposal package. The following subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan.

Written justification must be provided if the minimum small business goals cannot be met. The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFAR 19.7, Appendix DD. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.</p>

<DESC><strong><br /></strong><br />Multi-Page personalization equipment for an 88mm X 125mm sized booklet<br />This RFI is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes ONLY.<br /><br /><strong>The purpose of this RFI is to determine which if any machine vendors have the capability to build a piece of printing equipment that will automate the manual process used for issuing Merchant Mariner Credentials.<br /></strong>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is requesting information pertaining to personalization/issuance equipment systems that can personalize 88mm X 125mm sized booklets. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks information on the capabilities of personalization equipment manufacturers in the areas of machine design, software integration and necessary multi-page personalization requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The GPO presently supports a federal agency licensing program. The personalization processes in that program are currently being done by desktop laser printers. The GPO would like to explore new equipment and systems to improve throughput, reliability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>The current book specs are:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Booklet size: 88mm X 125mm</p>
<p>&bull; Thickness of closed booklet: 2.63mm</p>
<p>&bull; Thickness of single page: .12mm</p>
<p>&bull; Thickness of cover: .53mm</p>
<p>&bull; Thickness of spine: 2.37mm</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Information is sought on issuance systems that are capable of:</p>
<p>&bull; Creating high resolution photos and black text.<br />&bull; Applying a high security laminate over the personalized information.<br />&bull; Applying personalized information and security laminate on 1 to 20 pages (non-sequentially), including facing pages.</p>
<p><strong>Other requirements</strong>:</p>
<p>&bull; The personalization of printing and laminating a subsequent page should not involve any operator intervention. Once the processing of a booklet has started, the printing and laminating of each page should be handled automatically.<br />&bull; Proposed equipment should be able to handle security laminates from any approved vendor.<br />&bull; Any printing method (i.e. laser, inkjet, thermal, dye sublimation, etc.) will be considered.<br />&bull; The foot print of the proposed equipment should be no larger than 4ft X 10ft. Variations from this will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>Response Criteria</strong></p>
<p>Keeping GPO's goals in mind please provide detailed information that will help us determine what viable technologies are available. In addition to the above listed requirements, please specifically discuss these questions:</p>
<p>&bull; What, if any, special exhausting requirements will be necessary?<br />&bull; Are there any special materials or consumables required, other than the security laminates?<br />&bull; What are the electrical and or pneumatic requirements for operation?<br />&bull; Is there any harmful waste produced by the system?<br />&bull; What data system format is required for the proposed system?</p>
<p><strong>Printing Speed</strong></p>
<p>The proposed system should be able to accommodate, at a minimum, 600 documents (with 8 pages personalized) in an 8 hour period.</p>
<p>The GPO recognizes that documents with more or less personalized pages will affect the throughput of any proposed system.</p>
<p><strong>Required Environment</strong></p>
<p>The proposed issuance system should have no extensive environmental requirements for operation other than a typical office environment.</p>
<p>NOTE: Fluctuating humidity levels should not affect proposed system requirements.</p>

TRAINING</p>
<p>a. This requirement covers both aircrew and maintenance training, i.e. engine ground run that may require the use of a motion-based simulator. The objective of training is to provide the necessary skills to independently operate and maintain C-130A-H and commercial variant (L-100/L-382) systems, subsystems, and related support equipment. Training shall be to the level necessary to provide students a thorough understanding of their specialty requirement so that, at the end of their training, they can perform all tasks identified in applicable technical data with minimal supervision. Aircrew training objectives are to train aircrew members transitioning to the C-130A-H and commercial variant (L-100/L-382) aircraft, provide refresher/upgrade training to experienced aircrews, and to provide initial training to cadets. This includes ground school, flight simulator instruction and teaching students the capabilities to instruct others in this ground school and flight simulator. Contractor must have the capability to support multiple training requirements simultaneously.</p>
<p>b. Academic training may consist of lecture/discussion sessions and laboratory exercises. Testing procedures must be in place and documentation will be required to verify the student has gained knowledge and skills taught. If required, Structured On-The-Job Training (SOJT) shall be conducted in the appropriate laboratory, shop or flight line environment and shall include demonstration and application of academic studies.</p>
<p>3. C-130J Capabilities<br />Sources shall also identify if they are capable of providing the C-130J and AMP model simulator program.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br><br>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC), National Protection Center is seeking information on OUTER WORK GLOVES used by emergency responder and law enforcement personnel.  This request is for "general purpose" outer work gloves only, not special purpose gloves following National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Standards such as special purpose gloves for fighting fires.  The IAB Standardized Equipment List (SEL) item number for this equipment is 01ZA-02-GLVW.  The requested information will be included in the Outer Work Gloves market research.  By providing information in response to this RFI, you agree that the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program may use both the equipment information and any provided images in SAVER outreach.<br><br>Review of this information is being performed for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology Directorate.  DHS established the System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program to conduct comparative assessments and validation activities that provide the emergency responder community with information on important products and services.  Visit the SAVER Program Web site at https://www.rkb.us/SAVER/  for more information on the SAVER program.  All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used in SAVER Program documentation; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.  <br><br>The intent of this market research will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on the commercially available "general purpose" Outer Work Gloves that can be used by Emergency Responders.  Emergency Responders include law enforcement, fire fighters, and Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The different operational environments in which outer work gloves could be used in include: during extrication, standard rescue, medical operations, firing weapons (experience flash bangs,) protection from hot metal in high temperature environments, use with ropes, cold/wet weather protection, protection from threats such as sharp objects, needle punctures, or pathogens, and motorcycle and marine patrol.  The results of the market research will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the NSRDEC NPC endorse any product or manufacturer.<br><br>Specific information sought includes:  1. Company name and address. 2. Whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor. 3. Point of contact, telephone, fax, Web address, and e-mail address. 4. Product name and a brief description (75 words or less.) 5. Additional information on general performance characteristics such as: Cut, stab, puncture or impact resistance, dexterity, pathogen protection, moisture wicking, flame resistance, water repellant, heat/cold protection, tactility, durability, launder/cleaning instructions, shrinkage, lining, etc.  6. Cost information such as initial costs, General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information, accessory options, and available warranties.  Glove manufacturer and glove design must be well proven and established.  Prototype designs will not be accepted. The Government reserves the right to request samples and those samples will not be returned.  Do not send your piece of equipment unless requested to do so. <br> <br>The submitted information will be evaluated for potential consideration in planning future SAVER equipment assessments.  If a future SAVER assessment on this type of equipment is executed, the equipment selection will be based upon a number of factors, including emergency responder surveys and responder focus group inputs.  Consequently, follow-up requests for feedback should not be made through the Fed BizOpps posting agency.  Vendors may be contacted following submission for more detailed information.  Vendor provided information may be reformatted for publication in SAVER Program documents.  <br><br>Submittals:  Information about a particular brand/product should be submitted in electronic (MS Word) format by 4:00 pm EST on 22 April, 2011 by e-mail to Valerie Mandeville, valerie.mandeville@us.army.mil, put "RFI - Outer Work Gloves" in the e-mail subject line.  Submission may also be sent by mail to:  US Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center, ATTN: RDNS-TSN, Joni St.Pierre, Kansas St. D-107, Natick, MA 01760.  All technical questions regarding this RFI should be directed via email to valerie.mandeville@us.army.mil. <br><br>This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on this basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Submission of vendor information constitutes consent to publication of that information in SAVER Program documentation.<br>

Student transportation shall be provided in a way that meets changing needs during the day and through the week, and recognizes that a route or schedule that satisfies movement needs at one time may not meet the needs in another.   (example: <br>students need to get to class in the morning, away from class in the evening, to <br>DFACs at mealtimes. A bus route that stops by a DFAC when no meal is being served may not meet student needs.)  <br><br>2.	Seating on buses shall be prioritized for the use of DLIFLC student passengers and POM service members. However, when space is available, other passengers such as faculty, staff, other individuals performing a function on post and their accompanying visitors may be permitted to ride the bus from established stops and along established routes.  <br><br>3.	Schedules and routes shall be planned to meet 10 minute maximum passenger wait time during "peak" hours. <br><br>4.	Buses, routes, and schedules shall emphasize safety to people, vehicles, and property.<br><br>5.	Routes and schedules shall be flexible, capable of being updated and changed when needed.  <br>  <br>6.	Buses shall be handicap accessible.  <br><br>7.	Buses shall be able to operate on the roads inside of POM without any adjustment to the current infrastructure.  <br><br>8.	Buses used should have a reduced environmental impact compared to "traditional" passenger buses, whenever possible.  Examples of this might include gas efficient engines, low-emission exhaust and 'cleaner' fuels. <br><br>Responses Format - The Government requires that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following information:<br><br>Contract: <br>     a) Name of company<br>     b) Telephone Number, Fax Number, Address, and e-mail address<br>     c) Business size<br><br>Description of Relevant Experience:  Provide a list of DoD, Federal or other  contracts supported during the past 36 months with a brief description of the type of transportation support and maintenance, testing and licensing, dispatch services, etc. provided per each contract.  Only list contracts related and similar to those listed for this requirement.<br> <br>Response to this Sources Sought Notification<br>Interested parties should send a capability statement demonstrating ability to perform above shuttle bus services by 10:00 a.m. (PST) on Monday, 28 March 2011.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">There is pending legislation for the transfer of the Health Education Assistance Loans (&ldquo;HEAL&rdquo;) [as authorized by Section 701-720 of the Public Health Service Act] from HHS to FSA that would consequently require the transition of the software that manages these loans. There will likely be a need for FSA to host and support the applications should that happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>FSA would like to obtain an estimate of the cost associated with transferring and hosting the application in a similar configuration on the Contractor&rsquo;s servicing system.</span></p>

<DESC>This is for Market Research purposes only, not a request for proposal or solicitation. The Food and Drug Administration, is seeking sources, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses, 8(a) certified businesses as well as small businesses. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for providing the equipment described below.
<p>The Division of Product Quality Research (DPQR) at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, AR requires a Near-Infrared (NIR)/Raman Combination Spectrometer with automatic switching between the two instruments, equipped with multiplexed custom probes for in situ monitoring of protein therapeutic products during the lyophilization cycle. Due to the phase transition of the formulation from liquid to frozen, and finally a dry cake structure, it is essential to monitor changes in the system to understand subtle changes that occur during the process. Near-Infrared alone is not suitable for liquid systems, because water bands can interfere with interpretation, therefore Raman is needed as a complimentary tool to monitor the process during the initial phase from liquid to frozen solid. The two techniques will work to complement each other during the remainder of the cycle to monitor moisture content and other important chemical and physical changes.</p>
<p>The government is seeking capability statements from small manufacturing companies that can provide an instrument with salient characteristics as listed.</p>
<p>. NIR+Raman integrated spectrometer for online process monitoring of freeze dried pharmaceuticals. The System must be a turnkey solution incorporating optics, mechanics, electronics and software.</p>

<DESC>The FDA's Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services, in support of the Office of Regulatory Affairs' Winchester Engineering &amp; Analytical Center, intends to award on a sole source basis an order for a VHX-1000E 3D Digital Microscope to Keyence Corporation of America of Elmwood Park, NJ.
<p>Because of recent approval to expand a collaborative stent project with MIT, it is necessary to purchase the more advanced microscope to work in concert (and for interchangeability of accessories and attachments) with the already existing Keyence VHX-500 and VHX-600 that are used to inspect, measure, record, and analyze many different medical devices for material defects, fractures and out-of-tolerance dimensions. In particular the VHX-1000E will be used for pre and post test inspections and characterizations of the many stent designs and sizes that are life tested under this initiative.</p>

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate indeveloping a proposal addressing the goals and objectives of Broad Agency Announcement(BAA) NNM11ZDA001K, Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) Program.  The BAA can beaccessed at: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations.do?method=open&stack=push.     Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. andnon-U.S. organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profitinstitutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S.Government Agencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), OtherMinority Universities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs.   The Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) has established the TechnologyDemonstration Missions (TDM) Program within the Crosscutting Capability Demonstrations(CCD) Division to mature advanced space technologies that are of benefit to multiplecustomers through flight readiness and mission infusion.  This BAA solicits proposals forthe demonstration of space technologies that provide new system-level technologicalcapabilities. OCT TDM is seeking to identify candidate crosscutting, system-leveltechnologies to be demonstrated in the relevant environment such as ground, air,suborbital or orbital regimes. A key requirement in this program is that the technologyunder consideration must clearly be crosscutting. Crosscutting is defined as a technologywith potential to benefit more than one customer, where a customer can be a NASA MissionDirectorate, another government agency, academia, or the aerospace industry.Specifically, system-level technologies implies an integrated system with missioncapability and not component-level demonstrations. OCT is seeking new capabilitydemonstrations that advance the technology readiness of the selected systems, providetangible, innovative technology products, are cost effective, and capture significantpublic interest and awareness. The candidate technology must be mature, at leastTechnology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 at the time of the proposal submission (see BAA,Appendix A, TRL Definitions), and the proposed demonstration must raise the technologyreadiness of the new capability, to TRL 7 or higher, such that it may be infused into thecritical path for future missions.   In response to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) NNM11ZDA001K, partners are soughtfor the development of a proposal that is focused on the design, development, andexecution of a technology demonstration mission to improve the technology readiness forreliable and autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D).  The ability of space assets to reliably and autonomously rendezvous and dock enableshuman and science exploration, as well as satellite servicing/rescue, and is an essentialcapability for the future of human and robotic missions.  One of the challenges forautonomous rendezvous and docking is proximity operations.  Proximity operations totargets such as spacecraft, space telescopes or Near Earth Objects (NEOs) will requireadvanced autonomous rendezvous and coupling technologies.  Objects like NEOs that lackdocking infrastructure, and may also be tumbling, are particularly challenging.  Thistechnology demonstration will improve the technology readiness of full autonomy andautomation of rendezvous, docking, close proximity operations and formation flying thatwould provide future missions with a ready-to-fly capability that is reliable, versatile,cost-effective, and could be utilized in either low Earth orbit or deep space.  The goal of the technology demonstration is to help develop and demonstrate a robustAR&D capability suite that can be confidently utilized on human spaceflight and roboticvehicles over a variety of design reference missions.  This technology demonstrationrequires five significant elements in order to be fully successful, including;(1)	Relative Navigation and Mapping Sensors:  Design, development, test, andintegration of relative navigation and mapping sensors (including associated processingsoftware and electronics) which provide bearing, range, and relative attitude as well asthe capability to map the surface of a target in all lighting conditions.(2)	Real-Time, Autonomous GN&C Flight Software:  Design, development, test, andintegration of automated/ autonomous algorithms into real-time flight software operatingsystems, using the feedbacks from the relative navigation sensors.(3)	Satellite Bus:	Satellite bus design, development, test, and integration as wellas the integration of the technology demonstration payload(s) and docking mechanism. Other potential support includes; integrated satellite (bus, payload, and dockingmechanism) functional testing, performance and environmental testing, shipment to thelaunch site, support of launch operations, and on-orbit performance verification.(4)	Mission Operations:  On-orbit command and control of the satellite bus and thetechnology demonstration payload(s); including a mission operation center as well as theoperational staffing, training, implementation, and maintenance to provide missionoperations throughout the lifetime (TBD) of the technology demonstration. (5)	Launch Vehicle/Launch Services:  All services associated with placing thetechnology demonstration satellite into its proper (TBD) orbit, including but not limitedto; integration of the technology demonstration satellite with the launch vehicle, launchoperations and range services.	Ride share possibilities are of interest.   Potential partners are requested to indicate specifically their interest in partneringwith NASA LaRC on the Technology Demonstration BAA, NNM11ZDA001K. LaRC will consider partners with the proven capability to support any one or more of the required missionelements described above.  Partnership responses shall be divided into a separate sectionfor each of the five mission elements to which the response is addressing.      In addition to addressing one or more of the five identified mission elements,identification of potential solutions to meet the cost-sharing requirements identifiedwithin the BAA (Section 3.0, Item 6.) is of special interest.   If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that the selected partner(s) willwork with NASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.  If theproposal is selected, NASA LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to theselected partner(s) for performance of the proposed tasks.   This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules, andcost estimates.    Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria, in the followingorder of importance:(1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and key personnelavailability to design, develop, and execute low-cost, low-risk space technologydemonstrations (for one or more of the required mission elements described above).  Thiscriterion evaluates the proposers relevant recent experience, past performance insimilar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and keypersonnel available to support the development.  Substantive evidence of successfulparticipation in similar developments should be included.(2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposers ability to fitwithin the cost constraint of the BAA and to control both cost and schedule.  Theproposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule forsimilar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. Given the cost constraint and guidance on cost-sharing for this technology demonstration,the ability of the proposer to provide low-cost, innovative solutions for the missionelements and to facilitate potential cost-sharing approaches are of special interest.(3) Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development,testing, analysis, and operations) to conduct the development or demonstration of theproposed task.	The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and theability to meet the proposed objectives.   NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information inresponse to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposalpreparation costs incurred by the team members.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:	   LaRC will host a telecon with all interested parties at 1:00-3:00 PM (EDT) on March29, 2011.  In order to participate in this telecon, interested parties shall submit namesof two points of contact (with contact information) to LaRC electronically via email by5:00pm EDT on March 28, 2011 to Brad Gardner (robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov).    Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be divided into separate sections for eachof the mission elements described above.  The response for each element shall be limitedto 8 pages in not less than 12-point font.  Responses must address the aforementionedevaluation criteria.     All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via email by 5:00pm EDT onApril 8, 2011 to Brad Gardner (robert.b.gardner@nasa.gov) and James Corliss(james.m.corliss@nasa.gov).

<p style="text-align: left;">Solicitation Number: W912P711Pier36 <br />Agency: Department of the Army <br />Office: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <br />Location: San Francisco District</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SYNOPSIS </span></strong></p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information from any qualified demolition contractors experienced in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>marine demolition</strong></span> interested in the project to demolish Pier 36 in San Francisco, CA.</p>

Please identify your small business category: Small Business, Certified 8a, Certified HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>This project is planned for pre-solicitation in July 2011. The estimated cost range according to FAR 36.204 is between $5,000,000 and $ 10,000,000. The NAICS Code is 238910 for Site Preparation Contractor; the size standard is $14 million in average annual sales. The estimated duration of the project is 126 calendar days (90 working days).</p>
<p>Should this acquisition be determined to be suitable for a small business set aside, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines 52.219-14, the prime will self perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.</p>
<p>The responses to this notice will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for this procurement.</p>
<p>This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION </span></strong></p>
<p>Built of reinforced concrete in 1909, for use as a freight ferry facility, Pier 36 was originally 721-feet long and 201-feet wide. Outer wood portions of the Pier have deteriorated and been largely removed. Recently, further deterioration has necessitated closing the pier and securing it with fencing to prevent entry.</p>
<p>Deteriorating sections of decking and wooden support pieces continue to rot, break and float out into the Bay, representing a potential hazard to navigation in the adjacent federal channel. Portions of Pier 36 were constructed using creosote-soaked pilings, which contain a class of chemical compounds known to affect the viability of fish spawning. Use of creosote-treated wood is now prohibited in new construction in San Francisco Bay. Removal of Pier 36, including freestanding piles, would eliminate these navigational and environmental hazards. The project area is located within the Embarcadero Waterfront National Register Historic District, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.</p>
<p>This demolition project includes all structural elements and appurtenant facilities located within the demolition areas. Demolition will include removing the entire Pier 36 and its supporting structures, including:</p>
<p>1) Two sheds of different construction both containing hazardous materials;</p>
<p>2) Demolition of entire concrete deck;</p>
<p>3) Demolition of all supporting structures underneath, including concrete and timber piles and caissons; demolish and clear all structure elements beyond (east of) existing Pier 36 deck, including the collapsed structure debris and remaining timber structure.</p>
<p>4) Demolish entire marginal wharf and its supporting structures within the work limit (from north edge of Pier 38 to south edge of Pier 32), including the art ribbon along and above the sidewalk (only in areas where it is on top of the marginal wharf), and Pier 34 existing caissons.</p>
<p>5) Within work limit as shown, seal off all utilities to seawall.</p>
<p>6) Protect all storm water outfalls within work limit to ensure continuous operation.</p>
<p>7) Prevent any debris to fall onto Bay surface.</p>
<p>8) Stabilize the site condition for safety after demolition project.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAPABILITY STATEMENT </span></strong></p>

<a href="mailto:NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil">NMLC Research</a>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Emory University, 201 Dowman Drive, Atlanta, GA 30322, for the performance of research and development (R&D), preclinical and clinical studies in support of the Naval Medical Research Center.  This requirement will establish a research and development capability to address the Joint Force Protection Research Gap Inadequate definitive, restorative, and rehabilitative medical care and surgery for life- and limb- and eyesight-saving actions.  The goal of this requirement is to develop an immune suppression strategy that limits adverse effects of immune suppression and enhance long-term graft survival.
  Studies will include preclinical and clinical work to include mechanistic studies that will be conducted in rodents.  The translational research of new treatment combinations will be tested in non-human primates (NHPs).  The estimated value of the contract is $1.8 Million and the period of performance will be up to 18 months. This effort will complement a previous collaboration between the Regenerative Medicine Department of the Naval Medical Research Center and Emory University on the development of tolerance induction strategies for composite tissue transplantation and a clinical hand transplant program.  Under a prior award Emory University was able to establish the logistical support for the clinical protocol to conduct hand transplants, identified and enrolled the initial patients to be recipients.
  Emory has also identified an immunosuppression strategy based on non-human primate (NHP) studies completed under the prior award.  Emory University possesses a unique comprehensive multidisciplinary composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) research program.  The university has the capability to transition treatment protocols from the basic laboratory to the clinic and back to the laboratory to efficiently improve the applications of composite tissue allotransplantation.  To date, the team at Emory University holds the largest experience reported in the scientific literature in CTA in NHPs.  The clinical studies will leverage the considerable scientific support afforded by the Emory Transplant Center.
  In addition, the transplant program at Emory is the only one in the United States with an established composite tissue allotransplantation at a United States Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital and is therefore uniquely positioned to offer this experimental therapy to active duty service members as well as veterans. Based on these unique capabilities and the previous work done with the Emory Transplant Center, Emory University is the only institution capable of meeting the Governments requirements. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data and other information sufficient to determine capability to perform the proposed contract effort.
  All capability statements received by 2:00 PM Eastern Time on April 8, 2011 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Capability statements shall be submitted by email ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.

<DESC>**See Attached Flyer for specific information and registration** The industry forum is an exchange of information among all interested parties to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements. Project overview:  The estimated cost of this potential project is more than $80,000,000.  The NAICS Code is 238220 with the annual size standard of $14.0 Million.  This project will convert all of the existing facilities at Naval Station Great Lakes serviced by the Navy central steam system from a central steam heat source to a building-level heat source and demolish the existing steam system.
  Above ground lines will be removed and associated asbestos will be abated.  New infrastructure, which may include new gas lines or other supporting systems, will be provided to support direct conversion equipment.  Information systems provide an installation-wide public safety network (PSNeT) and integrate all facility industrial control systems.  This includes a centralized energy monitoring/direct digital control system, facility-level metering, remote monitoring and operation of new and existing building-level heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment and systems.  The project also includes demolition of facilities to include the power plant and fuel tank and relocation of equipment and personnel to renovated facilities.
  Please also reference Sources Sought for Solicitation N4008311R0016.  The Industry Forum Conference (see attached flyer) will be held on April 19, 2011 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. followed by Capabilities Presentations for those firms interested in presenting capabilities (small businesses) as they relate to this project.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.501.  However, the Government will consider all responses received by 2:00pm EST on 30 March 2011.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

The DASN (CHR) has instructed the Executive Management Program Office (EMPO) to continue delivering DON SES Leadership Development programs and services.
 This includes administering assessments and produce feedback reports for up to 100 DON SES per year; Supporting the Leader as Mentor training courses to the DON Executive community; and, providing competency-based and structured executive interviewing technology. The Period of Performance for this effort would be 12 months with two one-year option periods.

The DONs requirements for further work are based upon the foundation of the competency model already developed, including: administration of approximately 150-200 PROFILOR assessments annually. Should we decide to open competition to other vendors for comparable assessments, it would require the DON to start at the beginning with the development of a new competency model.
 This would add additional cost and time to the current schedule. In addition, the EMPO would be required to re-engage the 60 executives who participated in the PDI validation project, totaling approximately 200 executive hours. Further, the DON has partnered with PDI to certify a pool of executive coaches to deliver PROFILOR assessment feedback. Selection of another vendor would require retraining and certification of the executive coaching pool, adding additional cost. 

Also, the EMPO worked with the CNOs Executive Learning Office to align competency models and curriculum that would allow for joint training opportunities between officers and senior executives. The Flag Officer competency model was developed with PDI and validated as being applicable for the successful performance of SES roles.
 EMPO would save considerably by customizing the Flag Officer model rather than creating and validating a new SES model. 

Based on this, PDI is the only vendor with the capability to deliver a solution to meet the DONs immediate requirements and in a timely manner. 

The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 611430.  All responses may be sent via email only to Shannon Mitchell at Shannon.Mitchell@navy.mil and reference number N0018911Q1229.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Human Resources (OHR), in Washington DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to Economic systems, Inc (ESI), of Falls Church, VA, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this purchase order is to acquire access, for a base-year and four 1-year option periods, to software to process Federal Retirement and Benefits calculations.
<p>NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>It has been determined that ESI is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement, based on the reasoning outlined below:</p>
<p>FRB Web&copy; Integrated Solution is a unique product affected by several features, including (but not limited to) the integration of the comprehensive retirement calculator (Federal retirement, Social Security Disability and Old Age Benefits and Federal Thrift Savings Plan annuities); the Office of Personnel Management chartered Federal Employees Retirement Coverage Correction Act (FERCCA) calculator. With the increase and high demand of processing highly difficult FERCCA cases, the Agency would not be able to meet its processing standards in the absence of not having this system in place for Specialists. FRB also offers automated pre-filled government forms; its Web-based environment, and simultaneous access for HR specialists and employees. This product includes 52 automated and pre-filled human resources forms for retirement, on boarding and separation processing. Data entered for retirement calculations (such as the detailed service history) that are common to the forms is pre-filled on the forms.</p>
<p>Additionally, Economic Systems, Inc.'s (ESI) FRB Calculator is vital to EPA's Retirement &amp; Benefits Processing and Intake Process. ESI provides software for multiple human resources functions that our HR Specialists utilize on a daily basis. Specifically, the retirement calculator in FRB handles the following responsibilities for the Agency: voluntary, early and disability retirement benefits processing; part-time and intermittent service; deposits and re-deposits owed; Social Security/FERS supplement benefits; Thrift Saving Plan benefits; survivor benefits; and severance pay. The application also contains electronic access to CSRS, FERS, and other OPM forms for electronic form filing, data storage, and case management. Data in the central database is updated bi-weekly with data from the agency payroll/personnel system.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted, there is no other vendor that offers a product that includes all of these required capabilities. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Ben Shih, Contract Specialist, to shih.benjamin@epa.gov by the listed response date. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Ben Shih, Contract Specialist, to shih.benjamin@epa.gov.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;"TRACE Conservation and Closure Model Development." (RES-11-090)
<p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with John Marvin Inc, for work related to the development of improved conservation equation and dispersed field models for the TRACE code. This work will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Incorporating the dispersed droplet field(s) into the conservation equations<br />&bull; Developing and implementing droplet closure relationships (entrainment and deposition models, enhanced heat transfer, etc.) for all flow regimes and geometries<br />&bull; Performing code robustness and stability improvements related to the droplet models</p>
<p>Secondly, John Marvin, Inc., will develop and implement into the TRACE code a fully-conservative formulation of the momentum equation. This work will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Implementing a fully-conservative formulation of the momentum equation into TRACE for both 1-D and 3-D components, using both the semi-implicit and SETS solution methods<br />&bull; Performing code robustness and stability improvements related to the fully-conservative momentum equations</p>
<p><br />John Marvin, Inc., is the only commercially available source that is uniquely qualified to perform the proposed work under this requirement. Firstly, John Marvin, Inc., will perform TRACE development work to improve the new droplet field modeling capability of the code.</p>
<p>This contract is aimed at updating some of the base structure of how the code functions, so only an expert in the field of code development who has dealt with the same issues in other similar computer codes would be capable of implementing the correct approach and understanding the pitfalls of those approaches. Utilizing a contractor with less experience would inevitably result in a protracted effort and, perhaps, substandard performance of the TRACE code.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be thirty six (36) months from the date of award. This is not a request for competitive proposals. Requests for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Daniel App, Contract Specialist by phone at (301) 492-3606 or via e-mail at Daniel.App@nrc.gov. See Numbered Note 22.</p>

<DESC><p>Special Notice 11-SN-0013</p>
<p>Description: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The Office of Naval Research intends to execute a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee modification to task order 0003 under N00014-04-D-0576 with Marine Acoustics, Inc. on or about 11 April 2011. The period of performance will be six months with three additional one-month options. The estimated value of the contract, including options, is $307,000.00. ONR intends to award a sole source award; however, all responsible capable offerors may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote and it shall be considered.</p>
<p>The prospective contractor shall provide Research and Development and Program Support related to measurement and analysis of the performance and effectiveness of new and improved systems and technologies included in the ONR Littoral ASW (LASW) Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) projects during the Littoral Warfare Advanced Development (LWAD) at-sea field testing and demonstration program.</p>
<p>ONR intends to award this requirement as a sole source to Marine Acoustics Inc because the contractor provides unique knowledge and expertise related to analysis and testing of research and development efforts; this expertise is not available in the short term pending the anticipated award of a competitive follow-on contract to the current task order. The Key personnel under the Marine Acoustics contract holds the required Top Secret, SCI clearance. Marine Acoustics has the ability to manage very complex at sea experiments, including one scheduled for May 2011. The contractor has experience in planning and managing large and complex ASW exercises that will meet LASW FNC exit criteria including collecting sufficient data to statistically determine Probability of Detection (PD) and False Alarm Rate (FAR).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which, if received within ten calendar days of publication of this notice, shall be considered by ONR. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">All suppliers interested in doing business with the U.S. Postal Service should register their organization in the Supplier Registration module of the USPS eSourcing solution. Registration provides suppliers the opportunity to ensure their organization is included in this extensive supplier database.<br /><br />USPS eSourcing is a web-based electronic solicitation and reverse auction application that automates, standardizes, and streamlines the sourcing of supplies, services, equipment, transportation, and facilities. The solution is also utilized as one additional method for USPS to search for viable suppliers. <br /><br />Supplier registration provides suppliers eligibility to participate in USPS eSourcing events. Suppliers can access the solution at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com</span>. Once on the landing page, simply click on the "Register Supplier Organization" hyperlink to begin the registration process. Suppliers are encouraged to review the eSourcing Supplier Registration Guide (located at <a href="http://www.usps.com/suppliers/howto/registration.htm">http://www.usps.com/suppliers/howto/registration.htm</a>)<br />&nbsp;prior to starting the registration process. This guide provides insight to completing the registration entry. <br /><br />Once a supplier completes the registration process, the Postal Service will review the entry within one (1) business day to ensure it is complete and accurate. Upon approval, the supplier will be notified via e-mail of their log-in credentials.<br /><br />USPS eSourcing event opportunities are not posted within USPS eSourcing. Suppliers should continue to check FEDBIZOPPS (www.fbo.gov) to learn of any USPS opportunities that may be available. When suppliers find an opportunity that is of interest, they should contact the USPS contracting official for that specific opportunity to express their desire to participate in the eSourcing event. The USPS contracting official can then invite the supplier to participate when the event officially opens. <br /><br />Information about doing business with the Postal Service is available at www.usps.com/suppliers/welcome.htm<br /><br />Send questions or comments on supplier registration to: esourcing@usps.gov</span>

<CONTACT>Terricka D. Leonard, 251-441-6500

<a href="mailto:terricka.d.leonard@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Mobile</a>
<DESC>This is a notice of sole source intent by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, to modify Contract No. W91278-08-C-0021 with Hensel Phelps Construction Co. To Provide Facilities Operations and Maintenance Services for the US Southern Command Headquarters and Supporting Facilities in Miami-Doral, Florida for a period of five months from 1 June 2011 through 31 October 2011.  The proposed contract action will be an out of scope modification to Hensel Phelps' contract that was awarded in March 2008.  This action will be an extension of services which was awarded for seven (7) months under a previous sole-source action which was authorized under a Justification and Approval document approved at the appropriate level.  It is the Government's intent to provide for essential facility operations and maintenance service for a period of five months while the existing Army public works activity relocates, expands its capacities, becomes familiar with the new facilities, and develops a more comprehensive operations and maintenance solicitation to be advertised and awarded not later than August 2011.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all information received within fifteen days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government Description of Work.  The modification would be firm fixed price for 24-hour facility operations, maintenance, and emergency repair/response services for US Southern Command and US Army Garrison - Miami real property, components and systems, and selected improved grounds maintenance (roads, parking, storm water retention, utilities, security fencing and related equipment).  It may include a limited capacity to estimate scope/cost, design, and perform minor maintenance and repair projects not covered by new construction warranties and/or minor alteration projects to meet new operational requirements.  It will not include landscape maintenance, custodial services, or utility services.  The facilities supported by this modification comprise a new $400-million campus style complex, completed on 29 October 2010, and includes three state-of-the-art multi-purpose and command and control facilities totaling over 630,000 square feet, all supporting roads, parking, drainage, storm water retention, utilities, back-up power and other supporting infrastructure.  The complex is located on a Government secured 55-acre site in Miami-Doral, Florida and will support over 2,800 Government employees and contractors that make up Headquarters, US Southern Command (one of six regional US Combatant Commands critical to national security) responsible for command and control of US military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as US Army Garrison - Miami, and a diverse array of other supporting tenants and activities.  The site will be secured and will require appropriate Government background checks and identification for access, with some areas requiring a Secret security clearance and/or escorted access.  The national significance of this site and the functions it supports requires a unique and significantly high degree of response, urgency, and expertise.<br><br>US Army Garrison - Miami's current public works activity is staffed to coordinate basic building management services for the existing 220,000 square feet leased facilities and will continues to be overly burdened with lease vacation requirements and relocating US Southern Command's entire operations.  As such, it does not have the capacity to provide the extensive technical information, training and assistance normally required to solicit, award and supervise start-up of a comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance contract with a contractor that is not already inherently familiar with these complex facilities.<br><br>Based on numerous changes that occurred after beneficial occupancy of the facilities, the detailed technical specifications and data for these new facilities are not completely available and turned over to the Government.  This, along with the Army's severely limited public works capacities, will severely hamper making such information available to be included in a request for proposal in time to meet the Government's need for these services.<br><br>Hensel Phelps, as the prime contractor who designed and constructed these facilities, is intimately familiar with the facilities and has the unique knowledge and expertise to provide effective and efficient operations and maintenance services described above, without the benefit of complete and detailed facilities technical specifications and data or intensive Government provided technical assistance and training at start-up, which is currently beyond the Government's capacity to provide. Helsel-Phelps is also uniquely empowered to perform the anticipated extensive warranty management and service with equipment manufacturers and installers during the first year of occupancy.<br><br>Future Acquisition Strategy & Contracting Opportunities.  The Government continues to expand its public works capacities and develop a comprehensive facilities operations and maintenance solicitation that will be advertised through appropriate competitive contracting processes.  The Army anticipates advertising this requirement for interested contractors in May 2011, and awarding a contract in August 2011 for performance period October 2011 through September 2012 with additional option years.<br><br>This announcement is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. This notice is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Firms interested in being considered shall provide information regarding their capabilities to perform the requirements as well as past performance of similar work, to include project location, and names and telephone numbers of customer points of contact.<br><br>Written notification and supporting documentation regarding this action may be submitted in writing to: US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile, ATTN: CESAM-CT-C (Geanette Kelley), P.O. Box 2288, Mobile, AL 36628-0001 or Geanette.Kelley@usace.army.mil.   Responses must be received within 15 calendar days of publication of this synopsis. The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided. A solicitation is not available.<br>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p>52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.<br />Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

<p>(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>

<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>(s) Order of precedence.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>Gate 33 shall be used for all deliveries by truck to this base. <br />(Trucks will not be allowed to gain access through any other gate.)</p>

<p>Be advised that delivery vehicles destined for B / 3001 are prohibited from using "Staff Drive".</p>
<p>Delivery vehicles may make deliveries only in designated unloading areas.</p>
<p>Since your firm's delivery may be affected, ensure that your delivery carrier receives proper instructions on<br />delivery / unloading requirements for B / 3001. Unloading in designated unloading areas will minimize any inconvenience, and, attendant ramifications, which may accrue, to your delivery / delivery carrier for failure to adhere to this requirement.</p>
<p>TAFB 500-11 Contractor ID Badge Requirements</p>
<p>Contractors working on Tinker AFB shall comply with all procedures outlined in TAFBI 31-101, AFI 10-245 and TAFBP 31-101.

Identification will be surrendered to Security Forces personnel upon demand for the purpose of identification, investigation, abuse, misuse, or for any other reason necessary. Civilian and military retirees who conduct commercial business on base must obtain a badge through their place of employment. ALSO OF SPECIAL NOTE, in accordance with TAFBI 31-101 para 7, all contractors/contractor personnel shall be subject to background checks as deemed necessary.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:
In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has a critical need to expand its recruitment presence in the Hispanic community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, NARA's Strategic Plan calls for NARA to strive toward increasing the percentages of NARA employees in underrepresented groups to match their respective availability levels in the civilian labor force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, Hispanics comprise only 1.4 percent of NARA's workforce, as compared to 7.4 percent of the Federal workforce and 10.7 percent of the total relevant civilian labor force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional recruitment methods alone are not enough to address this problem, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed Federal agencies to look to alternative sources for Hispanic applicants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One source that is specifically recommended by OPM is the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>HACU is the only national education association that represents collectively those U.S. colleges and universities designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, HACU can provide NARA with a unique level of access to highly qualified Hispanic students, thereby increasing NARA's visibility within the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to meet the expectations set forth in the Strategic Plan, NARA is seeking to partner with an internship organization that can assist NARA in expanding its outreach in the Hispanic community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, NARA is seeking assistance in filling fifteen (15) vacant intern positions for the summer 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The internships will focus on locating, researching, and organizing archival documents and records of particular interest to Hispanic communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interns must meet the following qualifications:</p>

Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the Offeror that meets the solicitations minimum criteria for (i) technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement (ii) past performance at the lowest (iii) price.
 Offerors proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  Only those offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating technical information submitted in response to the following:  Offerors must furnish documentation that adequately demonstrates the vendors ability to provide the two 48kw Battery Systems in accordance with the critical features.  Such documentation can be existing literature, previous or similar builds of various battery systems, engineering designs, inspection records, certification records, or any other documentation literature that demonstrates the vendors ability to produce the required items.
  Documentation must include a list of equipment used for manufacturing the Battery Systems.  Vendor must demonstrate ability to meet the required delivery date of 12 weeks after receipt of order.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offerors PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.
  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.  OUTSTANDING:  Very little to not potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offerors past performance.  SATISFACTORY:  Little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offerors past performance.  MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offerors past performance. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 9.104, in order to validate responsibility, the Offeror must furnish sufficient information that demonstrates that the Offeror has the necessary manufacturing equipment, inspection sources, tools and other materials and resources to fabricate the required gages and meet the required delivery schedule.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that is has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.<br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [_] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.]<br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br />[_] TIN:_____________________.<br />[_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:<br />[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;<br />(4) Type of organization.<br />[_] Sole proprietorship;<br />[_] Partnership;<br />[_] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />[_] Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />[_] Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />[_] Foreign government;<br />[_] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />[_] Other ____________________.<br />(5) Common parent.<br />[_] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent:<br />[_] Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ____________________________________<br />TIN ______________________________________<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen.

<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>
<p>(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>
<p>(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.</p>
<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

<DESC>The solicitation is amend to add industry question and answer. In additon, to incorporate a 60 to 100 miles radius landfill for the government to dispose friable and non-friable asbestos.<br><br>1. INDUSTRY QUESTION: I was reviewing the combined synopsis/solicitation for the friable and non-friable asbestos. The document only allows for one price per ton for both. There is a difference in cost for both, and it would be beneficial to the government to have 1 CLIN for Friable, and one CLIN for Non Friable..otherwise all asbestos is being charged at the higher rate (friable). The friable is also less common than the non friable, so it could really negatively impact the cost of this service. Please let me know your thoughts.<br><br>GOVERNMENT ANSWER: NO, the government will not seperate the CLIN. The Government is solicitating for a landfill to accept friable and non-friable asbestos within a 60 to 100 miles radius from Aberdeen Proving Ground.<br><br>RESPONSE DEADLINE: This amendment will not extend the solicitaiton. Proposals are due by March 26, 2011 4:00PM EST, NO EXCEPTIONS.<br><br>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC><strong>****SOLICITATION DUE DATE HAS BEEN AMENDED TO 4:00 PM EST MARCH 24, 2011.****<br /></strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM23-11-T-0001 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48 dated January 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 561990, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Employee Services (ES) provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing and promulgating Government-wide human resources systems and programs for recruitment, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, employee development, work/life/wellness programs and labor and employee relations; provides technical support to agencies regarding the full range of human resources management policies and practices, to include veterans' employment and agency program evaluation; and manages the operation of OPM's internal human resources program.</p>
<p>ES's Recruitment and Hiring designs, develops, and promulgates merit-based employment systems, policies, regulations, and programs that Federal agencies use to recruit, examine, hire, classify and assess high quality employees from diverse backgrounds. Recruitment and USAJOBS&reg;, a sub-component of ES, is responsible for designing, developing, and managing USAJOBS, Student Programs, and Diversity Policy and Outreach. Specifically, Student Programs is responsible for Government-wide student programs, such as Student Educational Employment Programs (STEP/SCEP), Presidential Management Fellows (PMF), and for building a "student ambassador" and "college recruitment" program.</p>
<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years. The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In 2010, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of nearly 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>The PMF Job Fair is an annual event sponsored by OPM's PMF Program Office to facilitate the placement of PMF Finalists with Federal Agencies. This event is by invitation only for 2011 Finalists and participating Federal Agencies. In addition, a Graduation Ceremony will be held for Presidential Management Fellows completing their fellowship from the Class of 2008.</p>
<p>In support of its mission and goals, the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program has a need for a vendor to provide tradeshow and event planning services in support of the PMF Job Fair and Graduation Ceremony to be held in mid to late April 2011 or early May 2011, at a soon-to-be determined venue in Washington, DC. The contractor shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract.</p>
<p>OPM intends to award one Firm-Fixed Price contract to the offeror that represents the best value to the government. The period of performance shall be from date of award through May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>Offerors are invited to submit their quotations to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Contracting Group in response to this notice by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 23, 2011. Quotations submitted in response to this notice shall include the solicitation number in the subject line and be signed, dated and submitted via email to Benjamin.Delaney@opm.gov.</p>
<p>Only e-mailed requests for additional information will be accepted at benjamin.delaney@opm.gov through 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), <br />March 21, 2011. Note that communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in the cancellation of the requirement.</p>
<p>Vendors not registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and not registered in the VETS-100 database at the time the requirement is to be awarded will not be considered. Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423 or (269) 961-5757, or by accessing www.ccr.gov. Vendors may register with VETS-100 by accessing https://vets100.vets.dol.gov/.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 1 to RFQ for NMR Spectrometer Console
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to supply potential offerors with measurement data on the NMR magnet and answer questions received to date.</p>
<p>Magnet Data</p>
<p>1. Magnet manufacturer: Oxford <br />2. Magnet serial #: 62440 <br />3. Dewar/Cryostat #: 93894 <br />4. Project/Job #: DLN0495/30/1 <br />5. Magnet age: ~ 20 years<br />6. Magnet 1H frequency: 300 MHz<br />7. Room temp bore diameter: 54 mm<br />8. Helium transfer tube length: 1676 mm<br />9. Ceiling height: 3658 mm<br />10. Centerline to bottom flange: 320 mm<br />11. Floor to bottom flange: 662.5 mm<br />12. Stand height: 662.5 mm<br />13. Top flange to bottom flange: 725.5 mm<br />14. Top flange to top of He fill port: 529 mm</p>
<p>The magnet has a safety drop-off plate, flat bottom plate and anti-vibration system.</p>
<p><br />Questions and answers:</p>
<p>1. What is the expected resistance and inductance of the gradient coils? We do not have gradient coils currently, so we are unable to answer this question at this time. However, one probe manufacturer produces gradient coil probes with resistances on the order of 1 Ohm (0.7-1.6 Ohms, and inductances on the order of hundreds of microHenries (130-200 &micro;H).</p>
<p>2. For the cryogenic monitors, who is the manufacturer of the magnet and what is the type cryostat? Oxford is the manufacturer of both.</p>
<p>3. Is the magnet already equipped with He(l) and N2(l) sensors? The magnet is equipped with a console-controlled He(l) sensor, with level readout on the console as well. The current N2(l) sensor is a separate system and the display is not part of the console.</p>

The total value of all task orders issued as a result of this effort should not exceed $100M for the duration of the contract. Potential small business sources are being sought who can provide a range of support, either in-house or through prospective subcontractors. Contract Teaming Arrangements are desirable if they offer the Government the best combination of performance, cost and delivery. The affiliation rule allows a set-aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small business teams (small business as prime contractor with small and large business subcontractors) when at least 50%of the effort will be performed by the collective efforts of all small business members of the team. Based upon the evaluation of the responses, the Government reserves the right to set-aside this acquisition for participation by small businesses, qualifying 8(a), and service disabled veteran businesses.<br /><br /><strong>C. STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS <br /></strong>Interested/qualified small business offerors who can provide the requirements in accordance with Section A above are invited to submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC).

<p>4. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors during the proposal development phase for this effort. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Before contacting the Ombudsman, potential offerors should first communicate with the contracting officer for this acquisition. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Ms. Sue Hunter; 1864 4th Street, Building 15, Room 225; Wright-Patterson AFB OH45433-7130; Phone: 937-904-4407; FAX: 937-904-7024; Email:Sue.Hunter@wpafb.af.mil.

S. Army Contracting Command-APG(SCRT), Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Joint Program Office for Chemical and Biological Defense, Joint Project Manager- Protection, has a requirement for a Uniform Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment 1 (UIPE I1). The UIPE I1 will be a single supplemental system that will provide enhanced individual protective capabilities to the warfighter through reduction of psychological, physiological and heat stress associated with garment thermal burden, weight and bulk. It is not intended to replace currently fielded CB garments but will provide an alternative lightweight capability for selected missions. The UIPE I1 will provide protection from CB warfare agents to include retaining protection after exposure to Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) and other environmental contaminants. The garment will be suitable for wear while performing combat operations, whether on land or at sea, in any climate, with minimal impact on combat effectiveness. It will be designed to permit efficient communications and be compatible with current and developmental protective component systems. It will also be compatible with current and developmental clothing and equipment including load-bearing equipment, helmets (i.e., cranial protection), handwear, footwear, body cooling systems, and protective masks of the Special Operations Forces (SOF) and the US Navy (USN). Complete UIPE I1 performance requirements will be delineated in a detailed System Performance Specification (SPS).<br><br>The intent of this acquisition effort is to rapidly field a UIPE I1 that will reduce thermal and physiological burden and reduce weight and bulk, over current Chemical-Biological (CB) protective garments. Flexibility to accelerate fielding of the UIPE I1 by basing the design on a modified Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) product is central to the acquisition strategy.<br><br>The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type in which Delivery Orders may be issued for a one year base period and four, one year option periods. The Government envisions delivery orders which shall be Firm-Fixed-Price contracts. The guaranteed minimum value for each contract awarded will be $50,000.00, and the cumulative total of all Delivery Orders awarded to all awardees will not exceed $129,000,000.00 over the life of the contract.<br><br>The Government envisions that multiple awards will be made; however, it reserves the right to make no award or to make a single award, if in the best interest of the Government. If for any reason, there are no successful proposals, or a single successful proposal, the Government reserves the right to re-open the solicitation. <br><br>A small business goal of 30% is in effect and proposals shall address the small business plan. NAICS Code 315211 - Mens and Boys Cut and Sew Apparel Contractors applies with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.<br><br>Berry Amendment, DFARS 252.225-7012, applies to the resultant contract. Please note that items procured under this solicitation are considered chemical warfare protective clothing, and therefore the exemption described at Paragraph (c)(5) of the clause applies.<br><br>Contract award resulting from this solicitation is subject to availability of funds. Proposals shall be valid for at least 240 days. Please annotate the last day the proposal will be valid. Firms will not be reimbursed for any costs associated with their proposal preparation.<br><br>The Request for Proposal will be posted on the Natick Contracting Center website- https://www3.natick.army.mil/uipe1.html, on Monday, 28 February 2011. Proposals will be due on Monday, 11 April 2011 at 1:00pm local time.<br><br>All questions should be directed to john.conlin3@us.army.mil not later 4:00 PM EST, 14 calendar days after the date of release of this Solicitation. <br><br>

<DESC><strong>This is a Sources Sought&nbsp;for</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ANY</span> Small Business!<br /><br />&nbsp;</strong>Please respond with your corporate capabilities and any other relevant information that would allow USDA to determine your ability to perform the following type of requirement.<br /><br />1 BACKGROUND
<p>The mission of the USDA Satellite Imagery Archive (SIA) is to make satellite imagery available to USDA subscriber agencies in a timely and economical fashion during the US crop growing season. Key performance indicators are measured by timely distribution and receipt of requested satellite imagery during the <strong>2011 </strong>crop season, and <strong>providing bulk satellite imagery</strong> during the <strong>2011 </strong>crop season at a measurable economic benefit to the USDA subscribing agencies <strong>from May 1, 2011 through October 31, 2011</strong>.</p>
<p>The USDA's Remote Sensing Coordinating Committee (RSCC) recommended the formation of the SIA, which evolved from annual imagery purchased by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) from approximately 1985-2000. The SIA was officially established in March, 2000 by a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Foreign Agricultural Service, Farm Service Agency, Forest Service (FS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The National Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), the Risk Management Agency (RMA) and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) later became SIA subscribers. The members of the RSCC include the above USDA subscribing agencies and the RSCC meets quarterly to review SIA activities, as well as exchange satellite imagery information between the USDA subscribing members.</p>
<p>The SIA facility is managed and operated by the SIA Manager, with the assistance of one contractor (the Archive Assistant). The SIA Manager reports quarterly to the USDA's RSCC pertaining to imagery request fulfillments and he/she is responsible for the purchase, receipt, inventory, storage, and dissemination of satellite imagery to USDA agency subscribers, as well as the physical management of the SIA facility and the online Archive Explorer (AE) system at http://www.pecad.fas.usda.gov/archive_explorer/default.cfm. The SIA facility and AE system is located in the USDA South Building in Washington DC and it is managed by the International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), Office of Global Analysis (OGA).</p>
<p>All satellite imagery for the current SOW will be delivered by the satellite vendor to the USDA's SIA, and the imagery later distributed to subscribing USDA agency members through the AE system.</p>
<p>2 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective is to <strong>acquire moderate resolution satellite imagery</strong> to monitor the United States upcoming<strong> 2011</strong>&nbsp;crop season <strong>from May 1, 2011 through October 31, 2011</strong>.</p>
<p><br />3 SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Scope of Work is to deliver moderate satellite imagery within the lower 48 states of the United States to USDA's SIA and according to the requirements specified below.<br /><br /><br />a. Pixel Resolution: The horizontal ground resolution or ground sample distance (the area of the ground represented in each pixel in x and y components) of the multispectral imagery shall be no less than 20-meters and no greater than 60-meters.&nbsp;<br /><br />b. Geo-referencing: Orthorectification within 72 hours of image acquisition to a CE90 (Circular Error of 90%) or within one pixel of image ground sample distance is desired.</p>
<p>c. Band Combination: A minimum of four bands of multispectral imagery are required, consisting of two visible bands, one near infrared band and one short-wave infrared band (SWIR) is preferred.</p>
<p>d. Resampling method: Cubic Convolution</p>
<p>e. Cloud Cover: Imagery with 30% or less cloud cover is required.</p>
<p>f. Swath Width: Satellite imagery with swath width equal to or greater than 185-kilometers is required. Satellite imagery with swath widths less than 185-kilometers will not be considered. Larger swath width greater than 185-km is preferred.</p>
<p>g. Temporal Resolution or Overpass Frequency: The frequency of satellite-image collection should result in at least two scenes per month of 30% or less cloud-free imagery over the cropland pixels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>h. Cloud Coverage over Cropland Pixels: Due to constraints caused by clouds that can appear in any portion of the scene when a satellite is overhead, FAS/IPAD will accept all satellite images that are more than 30% cloud cover for the entire image but cloud cover is less than 30% over the cropland pixels within the image. A predefined crop mask that is accepted by FAS/IPAD can be used by the vendor to define "cropland pixels" and for determining if less than 30% of the cropland pixels are covered by clouds.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to advance the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.<br /><strong><br />Description <br /></strong>The primary objective of this solicitation is to support the advanced development of candidate products which consist of a <strong>vaccine component</strong> and a <strong>technology that accelerates the immune response</strong> for use in post-event settings following the intentional release of NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em> or in response to naturally occurring outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em>. In these settings, simplicity and efficiency of delivery of vaccine to, and the effectiveness in large numbers of patients are key considerations.
<p>Candidate products that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements are important secondary objectives and would further enhance the capabilities of a candidate product that accelerates the immune response. Anticipated benefits may include: decreased manpower and time required to prepare and administer the vaccine, maximum compliance of the vaccine recipients, and production of a protective immune response with 1-2 doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>Although vaccine components at different stages of development may be proposed, ideally, the vaccine component of a proposed candidate product should demonstrate completion of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing; have undergone a Phase 1 clinical trial; and have produced safety and immunogenicity results that support further clinical development.</p>
<p>Organizations responding to this BAA should have documented expertise in product development, including regulatory submissions, to advance the development and evaluation of candidate products, against biological threats identified as NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx</a>) or Top Priority Biological Threats in the HHS, 2007 PHEMCE Implementation Plan (<a href="https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/enterprise/strategy/strategy.aspx">https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/enterprise/strategy/strategy.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Eligible candidate products include those for agents identified as NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em>.</p>
<p>Additional technologies, when applicable, that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements, will be supported as components of the candidate product. Novel delivery platforms may be components of the candidate product to be developed. Cross-cutting platform delivery technologies applicable to more than one vaccine are also of interest. Candidate products include:</p>
<p>1.<strong>Vaccine Component</strong> - The <strong>vaccine component</strong> of a proposed candidate product should demonstrate completion of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing, undergone a Phase 1 clinical trial, and produced safety and immunogenicity results that support further clinical development.</p>
<p>2.<strong>Technology Component </strong></p>
<p>a.The <strong>technology components</strong> used in the proposed candidate product may consist of a new adjuvant, an immune modulator, a formulation technology or a delivery platform designed to enhance the immune response onset for category A excluding <em>B. anthracis</em> and Category B priority pathogen vaccine candidates. Simply changing a vaccine formulation, for example taking a liquid to a stable lyophilized vaccine formulation, would not be sufficient to meet the objectives.</p>
<p>b.<strong>Technology components</strong> should address reduced time to establish immunity with proof of concept efficacy data in animal models that demonstrate efficacy with the proposed vaccine- component and the feasibility of attaining a safety profile that meets all existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.<br /><br />It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5 year period of performance beginning on or about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 1, 2012. </span></p>
<p>The NIAID estimates that one or more contracts may be issued for a total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) of up $44.5 million for a five-year period of performance. <strong>Importantly, contract activities will be divided into manageable time frames with initial funding of only the Base Period. Funding of subsequent timeframes will be funded by Options. Each Option will be fully funded when exercised and will be dependent on successful completion of critical predecessor activities, including USG acceptance of associated deliverables when applicable. The critical predecessor activities should constitute Go/No Go criteria for successor activities. The contract budget will be aligned with the Base Period, Options and associated tasks identified in the Product Development Plan and associated Gantt Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.This BAA will be available electronically on/about March 25, 2011, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">http://www.fbo.gov/</a>. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not reimburse the costs of preparing or submitting a response to this Sources Sought Notice.&nbsp; Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary.&nbsp; The winner of the Design Competition may subsequently have the opportunity to enter into a contract with the National Park Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) will manage a design competition to improve the appearance of the security infrastructure used to control unauthorized vehicular use at President's Park South. This notice is to solicit interest in participating in that competition.<br /><br />The proposed design competition will identify alternatives to re-design the security elements while preserving the historic landscape within President's Park South, which includes First Division Monument, Sherman Park, a portion of E Street, the Ellipse roadways, State Place, Hamilton Place, South Executive Avenue, West South Executive Avenue, and East South Executive Avenue.<br /><br />NCPC is a federal agency with a mission that includes planning for federal activities in the greater Washington, DC area. The competition will be administered by the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force in cooperation with the United States Secret Service (USSS) and the National Park Service (NPS).<br /><br />The competition's goal is to generate creative and thoughtful design concepts that integrate durable, more aesthetic USSS security elements and improve the visitor experience in the President's Park South area, which is located immediately adjacent to the White House and its grounds.<br /><br />A selection committee will evaluate each expression of interest with respect to (1) professional qualifications; (2) experience with projects of comparable scale and significance; (3) capacity to accomplish the work; and (4) the ability to obtain a federal security clearance. The committee will identify a list of twelve (12) to fourteen (14) well-qualified firms, from which four firms will then be selected to proceed into the competition's design phase.</p>
<p>The four finalists will be invited to Washington, DC for a full briefing prior to the competition's design portion and will receive a $20,000 honorarium upon submission of their design. In return for accepting the honorarium, finalists agree to waive any proprietary rights or interest in their design concept, and ideas contained in their submission and agree to the incorporation of their design, concepts and ideas, in whole or in part, into a potential solution implemented for President Park South whether or not they are selected to undertake the project.</p>
<p>The finalists will present their designs in a public forum and to the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force - the selection committee for the competition. Following these presentations, the NCPC Interagency Security Task Force will rank the finalists. The winning firm may subsequently have the opportunity to enter into a contract with the National Park Service to refine and potentially execute their design. A formal federal and local review and approval process, including a NEPA Environmental Assessment, will be completed following the competition.<br /><br />Tentative Schedule<br /><br />May 4, 2011 Four finalists selected<br />May 10, 2011 Brief competitors &amp; begin design <br />June 17, 2011 Competition designs submitted to NCPC<br />June 22, 2011 Public meeting to review proposals<br />June 29, 2011 Competition jury<br />July 7, 2011 Announce competition winner</p>
<p>To learn more about the competition, please read the following design submission requirements and program and design criteria. If you would like to participate in this competition please submit five (5) hardcopies and one digital version (ppt, pptx or pdf format) of your qualification package that includes the Architect &amp; Engineers Qualifications Form (GSA form 330), a cover letter expressing your firm's interest in and understanding of this project (no more than three pages), and your firm's portfolio (focused on work relevant to this assignment). Please submit this (and only this) material by 5:00 pm, April 18, 2011 to:<br /><br />National Capital Planning Commission <br />Attn: Office of Administration<br />401 9th Street, NW, Suite 500 North<br />Washington, DC 20004</p>
<p>Primary Point of Contact and Questions:</p>
<p>Barry S. Socks<br />Contracting Officer<br />Phone: 202-482-7209<br />Fax: 202-501-2550</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Design Submission Requirements<br /></strong></span>If your firm is selected to participate as a finalist in this competition, you will be asked to provide three 32 x 40 inch boards (vertically oriented) containing at a minimum:<br />&bull; A general context plan that incorporates your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A longitudinal north-south section across the Ellipse from the 16th Street and Constitution Avenue entrance to the White House grounds incorporating your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; An illustrative site plan at 1/16 inch scale;<br />&bull; At least one section through E Street at 1/2 inch scale focusing on landscaping, lighting and street furniture and incorporating the USSS security requirements;<br />&bull; At least two ground-level perspectives of your design for President's Park South;<br />&bull; A brief narrative describing your solution with a focus on innovative ways in which you have reconciled the required security measures with the spirit and guidelines of the historic cultural landscape of President's Park South.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Program and Design Criteria<br /></strong></span>The National Park Service (NPS), the United States Secret Service (USSS), and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) seek to install durable and more aesthetic security elements in the President's Park South area and replace the existing temporary and unsightly security elements. The U.S. Secret Service will decide whether or not to make permanent the temporary pedestrian and vehicle closures in the area and whether the security elements meet security requirements. The National Park Service will decide on landscape and infrastructure changes to the area. NPS needs to ensure that the iconic historic nature of the landscape that is President's Park South is preserved and continues to be a welcoming destination for visitors.</p>
<p>A. <strong>Overarching Objective of the Competition<br /></strong>Replace existing security elements in the area, such as jersey barriers, provisional guard booths, canopy tents, bike racks, concrete planters, and standing canine vehicles. These security elements, while effective, are visually unattractive and detract from the iconic and historic nature of the area. The USSS seeks to install security elements that are both durable and more aesthetic at the vehicle checkpoints and along the street closures. The present temporary, unattractive, and visitor-unfriendly security and traffic management infrastructure within President's Park South should be transformed with a design concept that meets the following requirements: <br />1. Incorporates USSS security elements while improving the aesthetics and experience of visitors to President's Park South and the grounds of the White House. <br />2. Responds to security requirements and conforms to the area's historic status and features, its iconic nature, and its popularity as a visitor destination.<br />3. Integrates security requirements and the National Park Service cultural landscape preservation policies and guidelines.<br />4. Minimizes conflicts between official traffic entering and exiting the south side of the White House and visitors approaching or viewing the White House. <br />5. Creates an attractive environment that is not dominated by security apparatus for daily passersby and visitors approaching the southern fence of the White House. <br />6. Preserves and maintains the historic integrity of President's Park South including Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse, its side panels and roadways, State Place, E Street, Hamilton Place, and South Executive Avenue. <br /><br />B. <strong>Overall Site Boundaries<br /></strong>The design competition's overall study area is President's Park South which is part of the National Park System and includes Sherman Park, First Division Monument, the Ellipse and its side panels, as well as the associated roadways in the area. The study area is President's Park South as bounded by State Place, Hamilton Place, and the South Fence of the White House grounds to the north, 15th Street to the east, Constitution Avenue to the south, and 17th Street to the west. The competition's focus is the environment along E Street between 15th and 17th Streets, NW and the environment along the perimeter of President's Park South, with the necessity of incorporating more durable security features for the White House and its grounds while preserving President's Park South's historic landscape and vistas.<br />A more detailed program describing the program elements, White House security objectives, and performance criteria for the redesign of E Street will be available to the finalists.</p>
<p><strong>Resources &amp; Background Material Available to the Competitors<br /></strong>Background materials will be made available through NCPC's FTP site.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).
