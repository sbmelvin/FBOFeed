<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>NA Project consists of construction of flood control features in the Bechara Industrial Area (BIA) of San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The work is being constructed as part of the Rio Puerto Nuevo Project.  This work will include construction of a levee, rectangular c hannel, trapezoidal earth channel, and box culvert.  The Margarita levee consists of approximately 3,500 linear feet of trapezoidal earth filled levee, with the levee crest at a minimum elevation of +10.5 feet NGVD.  The Margarita levee is in a low, vegeta ted, marshy area north of the De Diego Expressway (PR 2) and Quebrada Margarita, and runs along the southern edge of the BIA.  The levee will be built over an existing overgrown construction berm built between high-voltage electrical transmission lines.  A t the upstream end of the project, the existing Bechara Channel, along the northeast edge of the BIA, will be improved with a rectangular channel 55 feet wide with an invert of –3.62 feet NGVD, for a length of approximately 950 feet.  Others will replace t he existing Kennedy Avenue Bridge and the culverts under the Marginal Road with new single-span bridges having a rectangular channel beneath that matches the dimensions of the new upstream rectangular channel.  Downstream of the bridges, an open trapezoida l earth channel will be excavated.  The trapezoidal channel will have a bottom width of 25 feet with the invert at Elevation –10.0 feet NGVD.  The earth channel will be approximately 400 feet long, ending on the south boundary of the Puerto Rico Port Autho rity’s Puerto Nuevo Terminal.  From the earth channel, storm water will be conveyed to San Juan Harbor through a 2150-foot long reinforced concrete double-box culvert.  The concrete box culvert will be constructed inside of a dewatered cofferdam constructe d of steel sheet piling.  Between the trapezoidal earth channel and the box culvert, the channel transitions into a 200-foot long, 180-foot wide rectangular channel to allow flow under an existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main.  Modificat ions to strengthen the sanitary effluent outfall main are included in the work.  The levee may be built of excess suitable material from the culvert excavation.  All unsuitable material will be disposed of offsite at an approved location obtained by the Co ntractor.  Work also includes traffic control, pavement repairs, secondary drainage, and utility relocations.  The construction time is 1080 calendar days.  PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  Best value will be determined by a trade-off process that combines non-priced and priced factors.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  The proposal will be comprised of a detailed w ritten proposal responding to all the evaluation factors and an oral presentation addressing specific factors.  The following factors will be used to determine best value:  Price, Past Performance, and Technical Merit. Magnitude of construction is over $10 ,000,000.  Solicitation will be issued on or about 26 February 2002 and close on or about 9 April 2002.  Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only.  Offerors will be provided a CD-ROM at no cost.

<DESC>Dear Sir/Madam:


The AHRQ is currently seeking information on the possibility of  re-programming the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) instrument, currently in a DOS operating system, into a Windows operating system.  Responses are welcome from and open to any member of an agency or organization who could directly or indirectly support this effort.  Responses are also welcome from the general public.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The AHRQ intends to issue a subsequent solicitation for the purpose of reprogramming the MEPS Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) instrument.  CAPI is a software program that allows for the administration of the MEPS interview on a laptop computer.  

The RFI describes the background of the MEPS and its current computerized interview schedule.  Your input is invited for information purposes in the areas of systems design and selection, promoting industry competition, time frames for feasible completion and the overall concept of the design.  Specific questions and instructions for responding are provided in the RFI.

As mentioned, all suggestions and/or comments are for informational purposes only and will be used for defining the contractual requirements for this opportunity.  Your responses will not be used for contract selection.

All questions concerning the RFI should be directed to Darryl Grant at (301) 594-7189 or by e-mail at dgrant@ahrq.gov.

Written responses to this RFI are requested by February 4, 2002.  Responses should be directed to Darryl Grant by e-mail or by mail at the following address:

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


The Center for Cost and Financing Studies within the Department of Health and Human Services? (DHHS) Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather information from the private sector on a proposed opportunity.  The AHRQ requests comments on various aspects of this proposed opportunity.


Background

The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is to support research designed to improve the outcomes and quality of health care, reduce its costs, address patient safety and medical errors, and broaden access to effective services.  The research sponsored, conducted and disseminated by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality provides information that helps people make better decisions about health care.

Within AHRQ, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is conducted by the Center for Cost and Financing Studies (CCFS).    The MEPS is a vital resource designed to continuously provide policy makers, health care administrators, researchers and others with timely, comprehensive information.  MEPS is the most recent in a series of medical expenditure surveys that began in 1977 (National Medical Care Expenditure Survey) and was repeated in 1987 (National Medical Expenditure Survey).  Since 1996, MEPS has been continuously in the field.  For most of these years, the focus of the project has been on access to health care, health insurance coverage, and health care use and expenses.  In late 1999 however, the AHRQ was reauthorized by Congress.   That legislation,  as well as our temporal budget submissions have expanded the role of the MEPS.  This expansion includes the following.

&#61623; To identify the determinants of  health outcomes and functioning
&#61623; Provide data to study the relationships between health care quality, outcomes, access, use and costs

The gove rnment cannot guarantee a bidder will make it onto the bidders list if registration is completed using only the web page.  Solicitation documents, including drawings, will be available on CD ONLY.  The solicitation will be issued on or about Feb 12, 2002, with proposals due on or about March 14, 2002. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, intends to upgrade the turbines at McNary Dam powerhouse.   Acquisition of this contract will be accomplished by using a two-phase source selection (negotiation) process.   First Phase will be the design, fabrication and testing of turbine models in a competitive model test scenario.  The models are to be designed and built to a model-to-prototype scale.  Models will then be installed and tested at an independent testing labo ratory and also at the Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Design Center in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Contractors who are determined to be most capable of designing, manufacturing and installing the turbine repairs and modifications required at  McNary Dam will be selected to participate in the first phase (model test phase). Second Phase:  The contractor who produces the turbine model that is determined to best meet the needs of the Government will be selected to manufacture and install a first unit (prototype).  After the prototype is installed, the Government will conduct ex tensive biological and field performance testing.  The results of the testing will provide information needed in the decision making process for powerhouse modernization plans.  Should the recommended plan be to replace existing turbines, then contract opt ions for as many as thirteen additional full-size units may be exercised. There are 14 existing Kaplan type turbines at McNary powerhouse that were manufactured by S. Morgan Smith, Co.  Turbines were installed in the late 1940’s and early 50’s during construction of the dam.  The units are rated at 111,300 horsepower at a speed of 85.7 rpm.  Runner diameters are 280 inches.   The new runners shall be a fixed blade mixed flow (diagonal flow) type or other fixed blade design.  Minimum runner diameter will be 280 inches, maximum diameter will be 290 inches. Contractors will develop a new turbine runner and the necessary modifications of the existing components to achieve the contract requirements through model testing in a turbine model test laboratory. Installation work at McNary Dam consists of disassembling the existing generator and turbine.  After disassembly the contractor will install the new runner and all associated new and modified/repaired existing parts.  Modify reusable existing parts such as  head covers and wicket gates.  Inspect and repair turbine and generator shafts, thrust and guide bearings, and wicket gate servomotors.  Furnish and install new bushings, seals, and packings.  Weld repair of cavitation damage to the existing discharge rin g if new runner is 280 inch diameter or furnish and install a new discharge ring if new runner is greater than 280 inches.  Cavitation repair consists of excavation of the 2 to 3 foot wide band of damaged area, welding a stainless steel overlay in the exca vated area, and precision machining the weld material.  Abrasive blast cleaning, non-destructive examination, and painting of most non-rotating turbine components.  At the contractor’s discre

The Organic Mine Countermeasures Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) seeks white papers describing technology concepts that will form the foundation for a near term  (circa 2006) Naval system for Countermine/Counterobstacle (CMCO) application in the Surf Zone (SZ) and Beach Zone (BZ) operational environments. These concepts must support the current naval amphibious warfare operations such as power projection.  Emphasis is placed upon the Naval requirements to a) conduct  breaching/neutralization of light obstacles, and/or all mine types in the SZ and BZ environments and b) safely navigate the cleared areas via amphibious landing craft.  Concepts should be able to be integrated with current and emerging mine countermeasures systems. Concepts should include technologies to enable safe navigation within the cleared areas. Selection criteria will reward those concepts exhibiting application to both mines and obstacles.  Responses which propose adaptation of existing systems concepts to the SZ/BZ breach problem in an approach which will potentially reduce development costs and risk are encouraged. Awards under this BAA will be supported by Advanced Technology Development (Budget Category 6.3) funds. Priority will be given to concepts applicable to the surf zone and exhibiting strong evidence of being field demonstrable within 18 months. 

Proposers should recognize that this offering is distinct from ONR BAA 00-002 ?Rapid, Organic, Standoff Technologies for Breaching Surf Zone and Beach Zone Mines and Obstacles?. It addressed far-term, stand-off  (circa 2010 to 2015) mine and obstacle breaching systems and associated landing force navigation technologies in the transitional SZ/BZ environment in support of future power projection, Operational Maneuver From the Sea (OMFTS), Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM), and Seabased Logistics. This BAA explicitly addresses near term (circa 2006) technologies that can be prototyped and demonstrated in 18 months or less.

(2) Instructions for Preparation of White Papers and Full Proposals

White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the operational, technical and logistical feasibility of the concept. White papers are due by 1600 EST, 15 Feb 2002. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award. Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising or if no white paper is submitted. Full proposals are due by 1600 EST, 10 May 2002. It is anticipated that funding decisions will be completed by 12 July 2002, followed immediately by funding actions. Though contracts are anticipated, awards may be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements as appropriate. The maximum length of an award will be 18 months. This BAA announcement does not preclude an offeror from submitting a full technical and cost proposal or white paper after published due dates. Proposals received after the published due dates may not be considered for funding under the Fiscal Year 2002 program, but may be considered for funding at a later time. Proposals in response to this BAA received after 1600 EST, 12 July 2002 will not be considered. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the submissions. 

White papers should be limited to seven pages and should include the following items: 
(A) Cover page, clearly labeled "WHITE PAPER", including BAA title and date, title of white paper, administrative and technical points of contact along with e-mail addresses and telephone and fax numbers; (B) Technical Description, to consist of clear discussions of the concept and associated technologi

Is the contractor responsible for any public relations activities at the display sites? If so, how extensive are these activities? A2. All contractor activity at display sites is considered public relations in support of NASA.  For example, conducting tours throughout the Benefits of Space trailer and answering questions regarding the exhibits inside the trailer.  All interaction with the public should foster a pleasant learning atmosphere such that it always reflects favorably on NASA.    The contractor may be subject to requests for interviews from media, for example: TV, radio, newspaper, etc. Q3. Is a schedule of events available for 2002 tour?  A3. A 3-month schedule is currently available for the Benefits of Space Touring Exhibit.  The schedule is attached for the period February 2002 through April 2002.  The schedule will be updated to reflect other venues across the country as events are scheduled. Q4. How many hours per day are the events? Is the schedule so that the driver/ exhibit support person would work no more that 10-12 hours per day? A4. Event hours vary.   NASA coordinates with the event sponsors so that the hours worked by the driver and exhibit personnel do not generally exceed nine hours.  Q5. How many man-hours does the installation/ dismantle require? A5. Installation and dismantling of the exhibit take approximately 2 hours for set-up, and 2 hours take down.  Q6. Does the contractor provide insurance on the trailer?  A6. The trailer is owned and insured by the U.S. government.  The tractor truck is owned and insured by the contractor. Q7. Does the contractor provide event and liability insurance? A7. The contractor provides standard insurance for the operation of a commercial vehicle.  Q8. Is security needed at any locations? If so, for how many hours?  A8. No.  The contractor is responsible for securing the property of the Benefits of Space Trailer Exhibit only.   Q9. Is a on-site visit required in any locations prior to set up? As our staff has managed logistics for the Navy Recruiting Display at multiple venues though out the US, we have found that we could ascertain all required information by working with show management officials.  A9. On-site visits are not required.  Pre-event coordination is normally handled via phone/email/fax.  Q10. Who pays for electrical hook up and service charges at display sites? A10. NASA pays for electrical hook ups and any applicable service charges at display sites.  Q11. Is trailer apportioned for all 48 states?  A11. Yes. Q12.

What was the number of exhibit events of the previous contract? A13. The previous contract was for 60 exhibit events. Q14.  What level of expertise is required for the audio/visual exhibit? A14. General operational knowledge of a DVD sound and audio/visual projection system is required for the audiovisual exhibit.    Q15.

<DESC>Reference original CBD Publication dated 21 April, 1998.  Under BAA 98-08-IFKPA, we are actively searching for efforts that address the multi-mission airborne platform known as Sensorcraft, that will host a variety of sensors, both passive and active.  These include equipment for electronic support measures (ESM) and electronic attack (EA), as well as radars for airborne and ground moving target indication (AMTI and GMTI), stripmap and spotlight synthetic array radar (SAR) imaging, and foliage penetration (FOPEN).  Because these co-located UHF and X-band equipment will operate simultaneously, there is the potential for severe self-interference due to the overlapping signal spectra and intermodulation products.  In addition, Sensorcraft will be exposed to both unintentional and intentional electromagnetic interference (EMI) from external sources. The objective of this effort is to identify ways for mitigating the Sensorcraft intrasystem and externally generated EMI through various techniques.  These techniques include the appropriate location and design of antennas, application of interference rejection filters, and signal cancellation techniques, power level adjustments, time sharing of signals, and the suitable choice of waveform parameters. The use of existing computer modeling and simulation tools for prediction of RF radiated coupling and for assessment of the EMI level at each equipment before and after implementation of the proposed EMI solutions is encouraged. The deadline for the submission of the white paper is four weeks after the posting of this amendment.  The white paper is to be no more than three pages in length.  The POC for this interest is Bob Purpura, AFRL/SNRD, 315-330-7685.  All other information remains unchanged.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER NRR-02-029, POSTED ON FEDBIZOPPS ON DECEMBER 20, 2001.

NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

The above numbered solicitation is amended to provide answers to written questions received through 3:00 p.m. NRC local time on 12/27/01.  THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS ARE CHANGED TO 12:00 NOON, NRC LOCAL TIME ON JANUARY 9, 2002.  OFFERORS MUST ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS AMENDMENT on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the solicitation and amendment number.  FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.

The purpose of this Amendment No. One (1) to Solicitation No. NRR-02-029 is to provide answers to questions received.  Accordingly, NRR-02-029 is amended as follows:

QUESTION NO. 1-----What packaging format? a. Loose tablets in bulk-about 10,000 tablets per sealed HDPE quart jar. b. Tablets stripped into unit dose format - about 20,000 tablets in strips of 14 unit doses per 20 pound carton. c. Standard package -- Tablets packaged in finished catch covers containing14 tablets, each-300 packages per master carton.  Any packaging format that differs from FDA's existing regulations for KI  is contingent upon FDA approval or the NRC's accepting responsibility for the selected packaging/labeling format. 

ANSWER NO. 1----- The solicitation does not specifically tell the offeror the type of packaging.  Note however, that Packaging is an Evaluation Factor worth 20 points.  The solicitation states, "Packaging--Extent to which packaging provides for ease of distribution, storage, and maintains the integrity of the tablets."  Thus, NRC has left the method of packaging up to the offeror. 

QUESTION NO. 2----- Production Quantity?In order to offer the most competitive price, we propose manufacturing all tablets in one production lot. Our test data indicates that 10-year product old still meets or exceeds all FDA stability/shelf-life specifications. 

ANSWER NO. 2-----As stated in the solicitation, Task 1 - Initial Supply-- The Contractor shall be able to ship up to two million KI tablets no later than 20 calendar days from the effective date of the contract.  Task 2 - Subsequent Supply--The Contractor shall ship the specified amount of KI tablets to the location(s) identified in the delivery order no later than 48 hours from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO. The period of performance is two years from the effective date of the contract. Thus, delivery of the tablets shall be as stated in the solicitation within a two-year period of performance.  

QUESTION NO. 3-----Invoicing?As a result of the cost of production, we propose an initial invoice totaling 75 percent of the value of the contract on a net 30-day basis. Upon shipment of each order, we will invoice for the balance due, pro-rated according to the quantity shipped plus applicable shipping charges. Again terms would be net 30 days for each release.  

ANSWER NO. 3-----See Attachment 1, "Billing Instructions for Fixed Price Contracts."  

QUESTION NO. 4-----Shipment?We propose two shipping alternatives-UPS or FedEx. Pricing would be a function of the quantity shipped and the destination. A small administrative charge will be included to cover the cost of palletizing, handling, insurance and invoicing.  

ANSWER NO. 4-----As stated in the solicitation, the fixed unit price shall include ALL CHARGES, both direct and indirect, e.g., packaging and shipping costs.  Therefore, it is up to the offeror to determine the method of shipping.  UPS was given as an example in the solicitation.  Regardless of the shipping method used, as stated in the solicitation, the offeror is required to provide the NRC Project Offi

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center intends to solicit pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c) (1)  See Note 22 the following company Ling Dynamic Systems, Incorporated, 60 Church Street, Wallingford, CT 06492-2340 for Model DPA 130/140 Power Amplifier with the following features:  Totally Air Cooled, Control Panel with Lighted Interlocks, Three Bay Cabinet, Automatic Sequencing, Interlock PCB Included, Direct Coupled and One Site Startup/Integration.  The Power Amplifier must be in accordance with the follow ing specifications: 1) The amplifier must be capable of interconnection with the existing CU964 Field and Armature Coil Cooling Unit, the FP57 Field Power Supply, and the W964LS-HBT1220 Hydraulic Table Pump.  The amplifier must be able to be connected to a ll interlocks and safeties, be installed to original manufacturer system specifications and be viewed at a central remote control panel located approx. 125 feet from the shaker system.  All start up amplifier controls must be able to be initiated from the same location and all interlocked monitored.   No safety or interlock can be compromised.  2) The amplifier must be integrated with the existing 964LS shaker system so that parts are available and in stock for all system components.  Service to all compone nts must be performed by personnel familiar with all system components and shall guarantee complete system performance according to original manufacturer specifications.  Factory support must be located at an east coast site in order to expedite emergency repairs within a 24-hour period to avoid expensive test delays. Factory service will be accomplished by means of a maintenance contract and will include both the shaker components and the new amplifier.  3) The amplifier must include RFI filters on each po wer module in order to minimize radio frequency interference and include transient protection systems that ensure no electrical spikes are passed through the amplifier on turn on or off.  The amplifier must have synchronized loss protection which monitors the input power supply and controls the output signal which activates safe shut-down when power fails. These features avoids potential damage to the shaker, armature and also to our test items.  4) The 8KW power module used in the amplifier uses the most c urrent IGBT power devices available ensuring availability of parts in the future along with extended life of the amplifier.  5) System performance must be guaranteed between the existing shaker system and the new amplifier.  The existing shaker is only gua ranteed to meet system specifications when both the amplifier and shaker is a matched pair.  If we mix systems, this would be jeopardized which could affect what tests our facility could accomplish.  Vendors who are not registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) database prior to award will not be considered.  Vendors may register with CCR by calling 1-800-334-3414 or by registering online at www.CCR2000.com.  This is the only information that shall be published for proposals, which are due by 14 January 2002 NLT 4:00 PM EST.  Please direct your questions to the Contract Specialist, Paula Kestler, 410-278-0795 or email: paula.kestler@sbccom.apgea.army.mil.  Please submit your proposal to the Robert Morris Acquisition Center, ATTN:  AMSSB-ACC-AT/ Kestler, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, APG, MD 21005-3013 or via email or email fax at 410-612-5270.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for a HYPERSPECTRAL LINEAR VARIABLE FILTER for the NASA mission to the planet Pluto (Pluto-Kuiper Mission) with a delivery schedule of eight (8) months after contract award. The spectral filter shall be a wedged filter composed of as many segments as it takes to cover the region from 1.25 to 2.5 micrometers at a constant resolution of 300 (lambda/delta lambda) (or a non constant resolution no less than 300), and to cover the region from 2.1 to 2.25 micrometers at a constant resolution of 600 (or a non constant resolution no less than 600).  The resolutions are stated for 40 micrometers pixels.  The spectral filter assembly may be a single filter segment or a combination of two or more segments such that the total spectral band is covered, within reasonable tolerances, by a 1.024 x 1.024 cm HgCdTe detector array.  The overall dimensions of the assembly will have oversized substrates for mounting: 1.3 x 1.3 cm for 0.15 cm margins.  The assembly is to be placed in very close proximity to the array.  The operating temperature will nominally be 95 K. The array/filter assembly shall normally operate in a vacuum and the filter must not undergo significant outgasing or change in characteristics after storage in air. Specification Summary: 1)Coverage 1.25 to 2.5 micrometers 2)Spectral resolution of assembly: lambda/delta lambda = 300 1.25 to 2.5 micrometers.  lambda/delta lambda = 600 2.1 to 2.25 micrometers 3)Pixel size: 40 micrometers (The resolutions given above are the convolution of the inherent resolution and the pixel broadened resolution). 4)In-band transmission of LVE: &gt;25 percent at all spectral positions (goal: 50%). 5)Out-of-band blocking:	&lt;0.002 % average.  &lt;0.02 % at any peak. 6)Functional form of wavelength dependence on position is negotiable 7)Dimensions (as stated above):   Substrate: 1.3 x 1.3 cm  (0.15 cm margin).   Wedged filter coating:  at least 1.02 x 1.02 cm. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>NASA, Kennedy Space Center, Procurement Office is currently conducting market research for potential sources to supply gaseous nitrogen (GN2) to the Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (KSC/CCAFS) GN2 pipeline system to support space launch operations.  GN2 provided into the KSC/CCAFS pipeline shall meet specification MIL-PRF-27401D, Type I (gaseous), Grade B with the additional requirement that the argon level not exceed 150 ppm by volume.  Nominal daily flowrates vary from 2500 scfm to 3600 scfm continuous flow at a minimum 5600 psig pressure.  Daily flowrates of up to 4500 scfm at 5600 psig minimum pressure are possible until mid-2004 after which one or two launch complexes may close thus reducing GN2 consumption to current levels (average 3300 scfm).   Launch support high-flow-rates vary from a minimum of 5000 scfm up to 19,000 scfm for up to 16 hours or 14,000 scfm for up to 24 hours, all at 6500 psig minimum pressure.  It is assumed the contractor would use a liquid nitrogen conversion system for supporting the high-flow-rate requirements.  If true, liquid nitrogen production within 60 miles would be advantageous to the mission of KSC/CCAFS.  Very high consideration would be given to a GN2 production plant, which directly feeds the KSC/CCAFS pipeline and is self-sufficient for liquid nitrogen re-supply (for high-flow-rate operations) within two years of contract award. There exists an extensive network of NASA owned underground pipeline (~25 miles), six meter stations, eight major valve stations, telemetry system at each meter station, cathodic protection systems, and other appurtenances which will be operated and maintained.  A nine-mile long gaseous helium pipeline from the CX39/CCF area to CX37 helium meter station is also included since the helium pipeline makes use of GN2 system's telemetry system and has a similar cathodic protection system.  Operation and maintenance of these launch critical systems is required to support of the basic function of providing GN2 to the KSC/CCAFS Space Port.  Pictures and further descriptions of the pipeline is available on the World-Wide Web at:  http://propellants.ksc.nasa.gov/gn2pipeline.htm NASA anticipates awarding a long term supply contract, firm fixed price (EPA adjustment included).  The current contract for this requirement will expire on June 30, 2002.   Potential sources that have knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and/or capabilities to supply GN2 to the KSC/CCAFS GN2 pipeline system are requested to submit a statement of interest, capability, past-performance, and proposed technical approach to meeting the government's requirements to the contracting officer.  No solicitation exists.  Therefore, please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the CBD and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It will be potential offerors' responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Interested sources shall contact the contracting officer listed herein for additional information.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  All responses, questions, and comments shall be submitted in writing to the contracting officer no later than January 30, 2002.  Potential sources may contact Ms. Lisa Morales at (321) 867-3860 for additional information.

Coumeri COR  (732) 532-9343  CONTRACTING OFFICER: John M. Adamitis  (732) 532-3473 DESCRIPTION:  Contract DAAB07-99-C-A253 was awarded on 7 April 1999 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The contract’s period of performance includes one base year and six option years extending to March 2006.  Option Period 3 is to be exercised on 1 March 20 02.  This Market Research is being conducted to satisfy the requirements of AFARS 5106.303-1(e).  The aforementioned contract provides contractor support for the Satellite Communication Set (SCS) and DSCS ECCM Control Subsystem (DECS) systems as described herein.  The contract involves both depot level and resident site support services and materials necessary to provide the ongoing depot level engineering support, depot storage and issue, and depot repair and overhaul, including redeployment of overhauled/ upgraded systems for the AN/USC-28(V), AN/FSC-115 (DECS-CC) and AN/GSC-63 (DECS-RC) and their respective component repairable assemblies.  In addition, the contract provides resident site support through Field Maintenance Technicians (FMTs) for the subject  equipment deployed worldwide.  The services of seven (7) full time FMTs and two (2) part time FMTs as floaters for option years to perform fault isolation, corrective action, engineering support and testing is required.  The FMTs are required to support s ite personnel  for the subject systems worldwide.  The Contractor’s Systems Engineering Staff provide analytical support to the FMTs on-site problems and duplicate and suggest corrective action for system anomalies reported by the FMTs.  In addition, all d epot maintenance, repair, rebuild, overhaul, and redeployment required to correct anomalies is accomplished.  The Government did not acquire a Level III drawing package, to be used for in-depth troubleshooting and engineering analysis of system problems an d anomalies.  Furthermore the proprietary nature of much of the technical data precludes the availability of such drawings (i.e., a complete data package) support for the systems for which this contract is intended.  The Government does not own the off-lin e automatic test equipment, automatic test programs (test program, test adapters & operator instructions), manual test equipment, test fixtures or manual test procedures necessary to fault detect and fault diagnose items submitted for depot repair and over haul.  Nor does the Government own the engineering data required for the development of either automatic or manual test procedures.  Respondents to this Market Research must provide level of effort and dollar estimates to acquire a full understanding of th e design of the equipment.  As part of the written response, a respondent must be able to prove to the Government how depot level and field problems can be identified and corrected without the aid of detailed design drawings.  A written response must inclu de evidence of the respondent’s ability to support the described equipment.  Responses should be sent to CDR USACECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-COM-S-DN, Ft Monmouth, NJ 07703.  For further information contact either Mr. John Coumeri at 732-532-9343 or Mr Jim Acerra  at 732-532-9298.  The deadline for response to this notice is 18 January 2002.

The Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake is contemplating entering into sole source negotiations to execute an out of scope contract modification for the repair and rehabilitation of the Center Section of Bancroft Hall (Phase 9) at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland.  The scope also includes limited specific components in all other areas of Bancroft Hall and is estimated above $10million.  Phase 9 was not specifically identified in the scope of contract N62477-98-C-0065 held by Whiting Turner Contracting Corporation, 300 East Joppa Road, Baltimore, Maryland.  The Center Section renovations represent the final phase of the entire Bancroft Hall Rehabilitation program.

Whiting Turner is currently mobilized and performing ($70M) work on Phase 7/8, which is due to be completed August 2002.  The current acquisition strategy is based on the dwindling lack of competition experienced throughout the previous phases.
