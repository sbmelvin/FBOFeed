<SOLNBR>4577
<RESPDATE>033106
<ARCHDATE>04302006
<CONTACT>Dy  Le, (609) 485-4636
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-0007 - Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) 1. Background Currently, no rotorcraft HUMS, along with the ground-based station, has been certified by the FAA to provide usage or condition-based monitoring (e.g., health monitoring) for maintenance credits.  Certification of a HUMS for maintenance credit purposes is considered to be a complex endeavor.  "Maintenance Credit" means to give approval to a HUMS application that adds to, replaces, or intervenes in industry accepted maintenance practices or flight operations.   AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, is the only FAA Advisory Circular (AC) providing guidance for HUMS airworthiness approval.  Section MG-15 provides guidance for Transport category rotorcraft to achieve airworthiness approval for installation, credit validation, and instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA) for a full range of HUMS application.  The AC establishes an acceptable means, but not the only means of certifying a rotorcraft HUMS regardless of complexity or intended usage to modify maintenance and/or operational actions.   Installation approval covers the certification requirements (e.g. hardware and software qualification requirements) for systems and equipment that acquires, stores, processes, and displays HUMS data.  The approval also includes the airframe installation or any one of these functions for a particular application.  AC 29-2C, Section MG-15, addresses the most complex and extensive HUMS.  Less complex systems may be covered by use of only the applicable parts of the AC.  In addition, there may be different functional distributions between airborne and ground-based equipment.  The requirements of HUMS equipment consists of common criteria; which apply to airborne, ground-based, and installation equipment; plus the unique criteria for airborne and ground based systems. The AC requires that any HUMS applications for which maintenance credits are sought must be validated.  Evidence shall be provided to show that the physics involved for each application is understood.  This will allow the monitoring technique/algorithm/parameter, rejection criteria, and associated intervention actions to be well chosen.  If an approved system is going to be changed, re-evaluation is required to ensure the existing credit(s) are not invalidated.  Re-evaluation efforts will vary and depend on the application type, the credit sought, and the degree of failure or malfunction associated with the component/equipment.    HUMS applicants are also required to provide the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Requirements (FAR) and Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), Part 29.  An applicant may be the airframe manufacturer, the HUMS OEM, or the aircraft operator.  ICA should address the integration of HUMS with the aircraft.  The applicant must address the ICA items listed in the AC for airborne and ground-based systems and equipment in addition to FAR/JAR Part 29. Section MG-15 of AC 29-2C was developed by the Rotorcraft Health Usage Monitoring System Advisory Group and first released in 1999.  This advisory group consisted of representatives from the FAA Aircraft Certification Services, FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group, U.S. Industry, European Industry, and Joint Airworthiness Authority.  This AC was written in a generic manner such that it provides the basic requirements and guidance for certification of HUMS.  Since no HUMS have yet to be certified in accordance with this AC on a "maintenance credit" basis, the FAA intends to conduct research to assist in the validation of the certification guidance.  Additionally, HUMS research efforts are to develop, validate, and/or demonstrate HUMS operational requirements, applicable technologies including processes; methodologies; and algorithms, and other required information including data to guide the certification of HUMS.  The results of HUMS R&D will also allow the FAA to expand the existing guidance by incorporating any lessons learned at the conclusion of the research.  2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct research to support the validation and demonstration of HUMS operation requirements, technologies, and processes and to collect and substantiate structural usage data for maintenance credits.  Particularly, this effort shall support AC-29-2C, Section MG-15, which can be downloaded using the following link:  http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements) and 5 (Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements).  Technical summary proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2006 (FY-06) funding for this effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as they can before FY-06 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) working days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email followed up with an official letter.  4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two-page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two-page technical summaries to: FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480, Building 300 (Attn: D. Le) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security protection. Thirty (30) working days or earlier, after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission of a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the items presented in the selected two-page technical summary.  Additionally, the formal technical proposal shall address all or some of the research requirements described in section 6 of this announcement, Formal Proposal Requirements.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having security protection. The FAA shall receive both versions of the formal technical proposals according to the submission deadlines required in section 3. Formal proposals shall not exceed 50 pages. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two-page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	Affiliation, contact or principal investigator name, phone, and mailing   and email addresses. b.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization,  PL8221, Scott AFB IL, intends to issue a sole source contract to AT&T Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182, for Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Transmission Services - CONUS (DTS-C) Access Optimization (A/O) services.  The proposed contract will provide transmission and bandwidth manager services currently being provided under Contract No. DCA200-97-D-0048, DTS-C, and DCA200-96-D-0096, Defense Switched/Bandwidth Manager Services - CONUS (DS/BMS-C), respectively.  No change will occur at the user locations; user sites will be rehomed to AT&T Points-of-Presence(POPs)/Bandwidth Managers serving the new DISN Core. This will result in a reduction in access/egress OC-3 connections from 35 bandwidth managers and approximately 4,400 circuits to eight new DISN Core and 19 ESONET connections from AT&T's network. This bridge contract will provide continued DISN transmission services until the follow-on DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract is awarded and circuits can be transitioned from the DTS-C A/O contract to the DATS.  

Place of Performance is various U.S. Government and contractor facilities within CONUS.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of  a 12-month base period with two 1-year option periods.  This action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow continuation of telecommunication services.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  Follow-on actions for replacement services are in process within the DISN Next Generation Program Office through the competitive DATS Request for Proposal.   AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  North American Association Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, applies.  See numbered note 22.

The Government intends to award without discussion but reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary in making the award decision. Offerors are highly encouraged to submit their best proposals, ensuring full compliance with solicitation requirements (e.g., required fill-ins, Reps & Certs, instructions to offerors, etc).  Award will be made to the technically acceptable offeror determined the most advantageous to the government considering past performance, price and price-related factors.

The solicitation (and any amendments) will be available for downloading on the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS), website at https://www.fedteds.gov for all interested parties. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review web pages at Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), (http://www.fbo.gov) and FedTeDS (https://www.fedteds.gov) for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information.  Any prospective offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.

In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Goddard Education Series (GLES) Program. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Greystone Consulting Inc, in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c) (1)--Only One Responsible Source. Due to timing of GLES training beginning March 28, 2006 and registrations already taking place for the upcoming class, competition was not feasable at this time. The vendor of choice has already tailored their course to meet NASA requirements and standards for the program. In calendar Years 2003 and 2004, The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. redesigned and revamped Goddard's original Leadership Education Series (GLES) and created a new GLES from scratch.  Using their proprietary, intellectual property for both the conceptual framework and seventeen of the eighteen training modules.  Greystone created a unique, integrated, and focused program that directly addressed each specific leadership requirement that was itemized in a center-wide leadership needs assessment, the Diaz Report and the CAIB report. Greystone personnel were involved from the earliest design phase through pilot program delivery.  In addition, the conceptual framework was used as the backbone for organizing a process to assist an internal review team in assessing content and structure of all other major leadership programs at Goddard (Accelerated Leadership Program (ALP), Leadership Alchemy Program (LAP), etc). Greystone provided continuous consultation services to Goddard's internal review team during that two-year process. In the fall of 2004, Greystone personnel delivered the 12-day, pilot program to 44 Goddard managers. The design was highly rated by all attendees. Greystone took the end-of-course feedback and made minor, but substantive changes, and provided a final course design to Goddard. Also included were a color photo-ready, 315-page participant manual and an extensive reading library of 75 reference books for in-depth reading on any of the course core concepts. Given the success of the pilot program, the Center sponsored three more courses during calendar year 2005. Senior Greystone personnel delivered 17 of the eighteen training modules. Each of these courses has been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades for both content and the professionalism and skills of the Greystone facilitation staff. This course is now viewed as an essential and core program for preparing and developing Goddard's managers as leaders for Goddard's future success. The GLES program that Greystone designed and delivered is totally unique in the public, private, and academic sectors.	It focuses totally on leadership not on management and is integrated from beginning to end. Three critical areas bound the program - managing self as a leader, leading change and leading collaboratively. Eighteen modules have been designed to span 5 leadership focus areas: starting with self-awareness and progressing through interpersonal competence, group leadership, organizational dynamics and environmental impacts. Each module has been constructed to integrate proprietary learning modalities into a whole that specifically addresses the unique nature of Goddard's culture. It is a rigorous program that fully embodies the needs of the adult learner. Teaching modalities span a wide spectrum including action learning, assessment instruments, films, small group inquiry, reading and reflection, simulations, role-playing, group and individual exercises, participatory lecturettes, journaling and personal coaching. Also unique are the extensive use of core learning teams throughout the course. Participants experience an intensive learning event that is profound enough to be transformative and pragmatic enough to immediately apply in their actual work environment. The course learning standard is one of trust and respect for all differences.  All subsequent learning occurs in the context of the participants leadership vision.   Each participant receives individualized learning and support in the form of coaching and program facilitation in recognition that successful leadership development involves both personal and organizational transformation. The skills of Greystone's principal facilitators, Mr. Jim Harden and Ms. Alicia Rodriguez are complimentary and unique, resulting in a rich learning experience.	Both model the leadership and teaming behaviors taught to and expected of the participants.  They routinely receive high praise from participants. Both bring humor and profound insight into the complex world of being a Goddard manager.  The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. expends considerable effort to remain current on developments in the dynamic Federal Government, NASA, and Goddard environments.  This enables them to modify the program to reflect current areas of emphasis and concern, while tailoring the content to the individual and collective needs of the participants. A key feature of the GLES design is class created projects that reflect the current issues and solutions that the participants feel are relevant to their daily work. Some 25 such projects have been created and presented by class participants to Goddard's Executive Council. The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc personnel have participated in leadership development discussions as a working member of the Office of Human Resources Leadership and Organization Development Team, both learning from Goddard personnel and contributing their expertise to the Center's leadership and management development and integration efforts. Given their lead role in integrating all leadership programs and in designing and implementing all of the first four new GLES programs, The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. possesses unique knowledge and expertise resulting in a minimal learning curve, thus requiring the expenditure of fewer hours and dollars.  Their integral involvement since the need for this program was first identified in 2003 provides The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. with a unique and comprehensive understanding of the program and the workshops to date.  This understanding is essential to ensuring that future workshops align with what has been taught and do not unnecessarily repeat content. It cannot be underestimated how critically important this thread of learning is to participants of NASA and to their contribution as current and future leaders of the Center. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on February 13, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit capability statements which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>99--VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<SOLNBR>PIXS4263
<RESPDATE>030206
<ARCHDATE>03302006
<CONTACT>Noelle Spalding, 937-255-3385 x3108
<DESC>VERY LIGHT JET (VLJ) CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1. This is a special notice requesting information to help the U.S. Air  Force examine potential capabilities and military uses of an emerging  aircraft class called Very Light Jet (VLJ). This class is generally  defined  by a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) no greater than 10,000 lb,  powered by one or two gas turbine engines (turbofan or turbojet), and a  commercial list price of much less than $5M per aircraft. 2. The Air Force is requesting information from appropriate companies or  parties currently developing VLJ aircraft on a) the capabilities of their  VLJ aircraft and b) the companies’ interest in supporting limited  qualitative evaluations of their VLJ aircraft by fully qualified Air Force  test pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) to be conducted  preferably by the end of CY2006. These qualitative flight evaluations or  ‘qual evals’ will assist the Air Force in examining military missions this  class of aircraft may be suited to perform. The Air Force desires to  perform these qual evals at either Edwards AFB, CA or at a location of the  interested party’s selection. The intent of the qual evals is to  investigate VLJ aircraft characteristics for potential AF missions and  will not require any permanent modification or change to the aircraft.  Broad industry participation in the VLJ RFI is encouraged, and VLJ designs  that are not mature enough for qual evals in 2006 are still acceptable.  During the initial information gathering of this VLJ RFI, request  companies planning to provide a capability response identify, to the Air  Force point of contact (POC) named below, the name of your company,  address, telephone number, and name and position in the company of the  individual to contact for future dialog. 3.  The Air Force is interested in assessing military utility for specific  missions that the VLJ class may be suited to perform including  passenger/cargo transport, navigation training, transition training,  Homeland Defense, surveillance, and target tow. Industry responses should  rank order the missions their VLJ may be best suited to perform, with  strengths and weaknesses of each mission discussed in two pages or less  per mission. However, as this is probably not an exhaustive list, the Air  Force requests identification of any additional missions that industry  believes this class of aircraft could perform. 4.  Finally, the Air Force is interested in obtaining current and accurate  information for each VLJ vehicle to include the characteristic data noted  in the Table below (this table is also posted to the PIXS library located  at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/default.asp).  Technical parameters,  likely concepts-of-operation, mission performance assessment results, and  price will all be considered during this AF VLJ capability assessment.  Responses are limited to:  a) a cover page, (including a name and telephone number of a technical  point of contact (if different from the contact information identified  above) having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses to  government representatives, a statement indicating if the company would  support a qualitative flight evaluation (either at Edwards AFB, CA or at  the location of the company’s choice), and a brief discussion of any costs  and/or liabilities that need addressed by the parties; b) up to ten pages for aircraft description, including technical and  general data summarized in the table below and descriptive text to provide  additional detail; and c) up to two pages for each viable mission. Participants will be provided the Air Force assessment of the capability  of their respective aircraft. 5.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For  Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to  award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any  information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does  not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to  otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost  under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent  Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation.  No responses received will be used as a proposal. 6. Further AF interest in VLJ will be dependent on the results of the RFI  capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and Air  Force operational requirements analyses and determinations. Potentially,  future leasing or purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain aircraft  in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or  instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation. These more  comprehensive flight evaluations would most likely be conducted following  FAA type certification of the specific aircraft under evaluation;  consequently, timing will also be dependent on certification status. 7. Companies are not limited to a single aircraft configuration for this  RFI; however, each VLJ aircraft configuration must be clearly identified  in a separate narrative summary.  Request that the narrative summaries  discuss specific aircraft information delineated above in paragraph 2.  Submissions are requested within 30 days of this announcement and may be  made by e-mail or mailing your response on a floppy disk (or compact disk)  to:             Ms. Noelle Spalding, (937) 255-7210 ext 3108             Contract Negotiator             Noelle.spalding@wpafb.af.mil             ASC/AASS/PK (Bldg 28, Rm 219, 2145 Monahan Way)             Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7017 With a notice of delivery to:   Mrs. Pat Krabacher, (937) 904-4501                                                 Contracting Officer                                                 patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil                                                 ASC/XRS (Capability  Planning Div, 2275 D St., Bldg 16, RM 053)                                                 Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7217 Personnel hand-carrying responses should contact the Contract Negotiator  to arrange a likely arrival time. 8. This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process  for obtaining the latest information on the “art of the possible” from  industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The  information collected may be used by the Government to explore future  strategies for the possible uses of VLJs within the military.  Information  received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and  will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained  in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information  received in response to this request will be properly protected from any  unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary  information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and  requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not  inadvertently restrict competition. 9. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this VLJ capability  RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly  answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some  release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a  question peculiar to a Company or that Company’s response.  Currently  one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not  contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are  conducted, they will be offered to all to clarify understanding of the  submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of  agreement to cover any Qual Evals.  Information feedback sessions may be  offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed. 10.  Technical point of contact is Ms.Trixie Brewer, ASC/XRC Bldg 28,  (937)-255-7210, ext. 3669, or Mr. Eric Crawford, ASC/XRC Bldg 28,  (937)-255-7210, ext. 3568. 11.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award a contract on a Sole Source basis to Horiba Instruments to provide five (5) Horiba MEXA 7000 Span Gas Selector benches for EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuels Emission Laboratory?s (NVFEL)Office of Transportation and Air Quality?s (OTAQ) Laboratory Operations Division (LOD).  LOD will use the Horiba span gas selectors to install into five existing MEXA 7000 analyzer benches in an effort to automate the calibration of all of its analyzer benches. 	EPA currently has 18 Horiba MEXA 7000 analyzer benches in LOD.  Five of the analyzer benches were purchased from Horiba without Span Gas Selectors.  In order to complete the transition to automatic calibrations throughout the lab, EPA will need to purchase five additional span gas selectors.  The span gas selectors must match the physical layout of the MEXA 7000 and be integrated with the Horiba proprietary software that operates it.  In addition to the span gas selectors installation, two (2) MEXA 7000 benches must be reconfigured from multiple range to single dynamic range.  This will make the procedure for running the automatic calibration software the same throughout the lab.  	The specifications for the Horiba MEXA 7000 are as follows: four (4) of the span gas selectors shall have eight (8) manifolds and have the capability of providing four (4) different span or midspan gas ranges to eight (8) different analyzers; one (1) span gas selector shall have 12 manifolds and have the capability of providing four (4) different span or midspan gas ranges to 12 different analyzers.  Contractor shall provide all parts, labor and supervision to install the span gas selectors in the five existing benches.  This work will include any necessary design changes, all changes in electrical and plumbing connections, and changes to the computer program and bitmaps needed for span gas selector operation.              The Contractor shall also perform acceptance testing and provide the EPA project officer with documentation outlining the new flow and electrical schematics of the changes made to the MEXA 7000 curve and midspan reports of the operational tests.  A one-year warranty shall also be provided for all parts and labor to repair any malfunction or defect on problems specific to these modifications performed on the MEXA 7000 analyzer benches.    	This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to the office identified above which establishes that their specifications meet the EPA?s requirement.  Documentation must be received within seven (7) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), Office of Human Research Ethics, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, for providing Institutional Review Board (IRB) Services for Human Research.  The services required are essential for research experiments involving human subjects.  The contractor shall serve as the designated IRB of record; provide review and oversight of EPA's human subject research; coordinate with and establish IRB authorization agreements; provide consultation to EPA staff; and provide training for EPA staff related to ethics and other topics relevant to conducting human research.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12 months from date of award with four 12-month optional periods of performance.  EPA believes that UNC-CH Office of Human Research Ethics is the only source capable of providing the specific review services.  UNC-CH has five IRBs, each with members who have specialized areas of technical expertise that align with NHEERL?s diverse human research program.  These IRBs have provided expert review and oversight to HSD for over two decades and as such are familiar with the large number and complexity of NHEERL?s often unique research studies.  Other unique qualifications of UNC-CH supporting EPA's beliefs are a preponderance of the human subjects research is conducted in collaboration with UNC-CH; the EPA Human Studies Division is located on the campus of UNC-CH; and the research must be reviewed by UNC's IRB  to comply with UNC policy.  Since the majority of human research protocols must be reviewed and monitored by a UNC-CH IRB to ensure compliance with UNC policy for on-campus research involving UNC staff, the introduction of another IRB would disrupt critical time-sensitive on-going research resulting in unacceptable delays.  The circumstance permitting "Other than Full and Open Competition" is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services shall fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in  writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541690, which has a small business size standard of $6.5  million, is applicable.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submit  response via US Mail to the U.S. EPA, Attn:  Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711.  No telephonic of faxed requests will be honored.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Eng. Khaldoun Qutishat, Secretary General, Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, Jabal Amman , 7th Circle,  Zahran Street, P. O.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct Technical Assistance related to the development of oil shale resources in Jordan.  

The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan depends on imported crude oil and petroleum products to meet its energy needs, which total approximately 75,000 barrels per day.  The drastic increase in fuel prices during 2005 has caused an energy crisis in the Kingdom, further increasing its public debt.  The energy sector in Jordan, which is currently supervised by the MEMR, has been undergoing significant development in accordance with the Government of Jordan’s (GOJ) program of economic reconstruction and development.  A recent GOJ initiative resulted in the preparation of a comprehensive Energy Sector Strategy.  This strategy calls for developing local energy resources, including renewables, to reduce the imported energy cost and to diversify energy supply resources.  Since the local energy resources such as oil and gas are limited, and imported energy places a tremendous burden on the national economy, the GOJ is paying special attention to the development of local energy resources such as new and renewable energy, including oil shale.  

Shale oil is one of the most extensive resources of potential hydrocarbons in the world and it has been considered as a potential replacement for depleting petroleum resources for the past century.  Commercial development of shale oil has been and is very limited.  The nature of the resource, small concentrations of oil in the shale rock, and the difficulties involved in thermally separating oil from shale make its recovery technically complex and expensive.  

Therefore, the GOJ did not previously establish an oil shale industry because the high capital costs of developing these resources made it economically unviable.  Nevertheless, the continuously increasing cost of petroleum has dramatically altered the situation and it now makes economic sense for the Kingdom to develop its 24 known surface oil shale deposits which contain more than 50 billion tons of geological reserves.

The objective of this Technical Assistance is to analyze the current state of shale oil extraction and recovery technologies and to apply the best international expertise to the development of a shale oil industry in Jordan.  Specifically, the Technical Assistance would evaluate different retorting systems to identify the best option for converting the oil products contained in oil shale to hydrocarbon vapors.  The results of the Technical Assistance are intended to:  allow MEMR to develop a realistic strategy for the development of its oil shale deposits for energy purposes both long and short term; and facilitate the implementation of near term actions leading to the commercial production of the Jordanian shale oil resources.   

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this activity consists of the following tasks: (1) Purpose and objective of Technical Assistance; (2) Technology screening; (3) Product/market pricing; (4) Economic analysis; (5) Financial analysis; (6) Environmental analysis; (7) Review of regulatory issues; (8) Key host country economic development benefits; (9) List of proposed equipment and services; (10) Strategic implementation plan; and (11) Final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $310,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation W52P1J-06-R-0062.  Estimated issue date is 17 February 2006 and estimated closing date is 17 March 2006.  Item:  20mm M940 Multi-Purpose Traced with Self Destruct Cartridges, NSN: 1305-01-534-2702, P art Number: 13011323.  This requirement is restricted to the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB).  A First Article Test will be required.  The total estimated base quantity is 1,000,000 each, with a 300% option. This RFP will be for a 60/40 spli t of the requirements.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal parts, (2) production of propellant, (3) cartridge case priming and loa ding w/propellant, and (4) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment are required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements .  Experience in ballistic testing, expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, and process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistic test range, 20mm single shot test (MANN) barrel(s ), and an M168 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and  machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of these cartridges is complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition process/design engineers, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test per sonnel, etc) needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, potential producers must be able to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test w ithin 120 days after award, with the first production delivery due within 180 days after award.  The technical data package (TDP) associated with 20mm M940 cartridges is coded Distribution D, which means distribution is authorized to DoD Contractors.  To r eceive the TDP, all interested contractors must sign a non-use and non-disclosure agreement due to a Government licensing agreement; and must be registered in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/.  A CD will be available from the contract specialist as soon as the solicitation is issued which contains the M940 TDP.  This RFP will result in firm-fixed price contracts.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization,  PL8221, Scott AFB IL, intends to issue a sole source contract to AT&T Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182, for Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Transmission Services - CONUS (DTS-C) Access Optimization (A/O) services.  The proposed contract will provide transmission and bandwidth manager services currently being provided under Contract No. DCA200-97-D-0048, DTS-C, and DCA200-96-D-0096, Defense Switched/Bandwidth Manager Services - CONUS (DS/BMS-C), respectively.  No change will occur at the user locations; user sites will be rehomed to AT&T Points-of-Presence(POPs)/Bandwidth Managers serving the new DISN Core. This will result in a reduction in access/egress OC-3 connections from 35 bandwidth managers and approximately 4,400 circuits to eight new DISN Core and 19 ESONET connections from AT&T's network. This bridge contract will provide continued DISN transmission services until the follow-on DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract is awarded and circuits can be transitioned from the DTS-C A/O contract to the DATS.  

Place of Performance is various U.S. Government and contractor facilities within CONUS.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of  a 12-month base period with two 1-year option periods.  This action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow continuation of telecommunication services.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  Follow-on actions for replacement services are in process within the DISN Next Generation Program Office through the competitive DATS Request for Proposal.   AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  North American Association Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, applies.  See numbered note 22.  Points of contact are Carrie Ross, email Carrie.Ross@disa.mil or June Tharp, email June.Tharp@disa.mil.

A decision will be made to issue this solicitation as a competitive set-aside for 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned, or HubZone Small Business contractors or to issue an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

A two-phase design-build selection procedure will be used.

The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years that are similar to the construction work and within the same dollar value magnitude (adjusted for inflation) of this notice.   Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.

Indicate whether your firm was the prime contractor or subcontractor on other similar projects. The capability statements for each project should be numbered consistent with the below requirements followed by supporting documentation.  Offerors need to provide a list of projects by contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and evidence of the following specific capabilities: 

1.	Recent and relevant construction experience within the last 3 calendar years, for projects of similar size, scope, and complexity to the project proposed above.

3.	Include proof of bonding capacity for your firm.

4.	Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status. 

The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company’s ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement. Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, or HubZone small business firms or to proceed with issuing an unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.

The product line concept will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops,  unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, equipment parking areas, and other features of the program.  Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assigned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).

8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.  BACKGROUND

Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has been struggling to establish a free market economy and a democratic governance system.  Immediately after independence, Armenia plunged into a humanitarian crisis as it suffered the effects of the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians, and the subsequent blockade by Turkey.  There is currently a cease-fire but no permanent resolution to the dispute.  Armenia slowly emerged from the humanitarian crisis and has been working on establishing and strengthening the institutions necessary for a free market economy, a democratic governing system, and an adequate social safety net.  Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts, there is still much room for improvement and much need for continued international support.

The U.S. Government (USG) assistance program in the Caucasus region as a whole is of particular strategic importance to the U.S. and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from the public and private sectors alike.  Given the diverse, politically sensitive, and rapidly growing country program, USAID/Armenia became a full-fledged mission in mid-1998, having previously been part of the regional Caucasus mission.  USAID first started its programs in Armenia in 1992, focusing on emergency assistance to the large number of vulnerable persons, including those displaced by the regions’ various conflicts.  

The current USAID program focuses increasingly on sustainable development in the governance, social, health, and economics sectors.  The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close performance monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.  The health portfolio works to strengthen Armenia’s health system and, ultimately, improve access to adequate and affordable health services.  Programs address areas of health system reform, pharmaceutical management, maternal, child, and reproductive health, eyecare, and women’s cancer prevention and detection. Presented below is the results framework for USAID/Armenia’s health strategic objective.


II.  Introduction 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of the
Country strategy and implementation of a program designed to create a democratic society and market economy in Armenia. The Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with a budget of approximately $30 million annually.  The DSRO portfolio is large, complex and can be divided into four major components:

	1.  In democracy, USAID Armenia’s goal is increased participation in civic life and more open governance institutions through which to channel participation, in order to stimulate the demand side for improved governance and to hold government institutions accountable through the democratic process.

	2.  In healthcare, USAID Armenia programs focus on primary healthcare, and a well-functioning health system that increases utilization of high quality services.  These factors are critical if Armenia is to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and low economic growth.

	3.  In social protection, USAID Armenia’s goal is an effective and sustainable benefits system, in addition to targeted vocational training.  Together, these are necessary to meet long-term universal coverage commitments for the disabled and the elderly, as well as the short-term needs of the unemployed and the poor.

	4.  In Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), USAID provides subsistence level humanitarian assistance to victims of the NK conflict based on the needs of these victims and in response to U.S. Congressional directives.  Humanitarian aid provided since 1998 is in the areas of shelter, health, drinking and irrigation water systems, de-mining and micro-loans to selected vulnerable population of NK.

DSRO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors.  These include the World Bank (WB), World Health Organization, UNICEF, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United Nations Development Program (UNDP), among others. 

Political instability in the government and frequent changes in key counterparts complicate implementation of the DSRO portfolio.  Additionally, many key counterparts have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had little international experience or education.  

The Health SO core team currently includes two US technical advisors and one FSN (FSN- 11).  Funding for USAID/Armenia’s Health activities totals approximately $8 million per year.  On a day-to-day basis, DSRO’s Health Advisor is responsible for designing, managing, implementing, coordinating, and monitoring major components of the Mission’s health portfolio.  The Health Advisor receives guidance from the Senior Health Advisor and will be supervised by the DSRO Director.  He/she is expected to work independently and making judgments/decisions as specified in this SOW.  The incumbent will have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Mission regarding the health portfolio.  

III.	Duties and Responsibilities

The Health Advisor will serve as advisor and program manager for the Mission’s health sector portfolio.  The portfolio includes the Mission’s flagship Primary Healthcare Reform Program, a large reproductive health project, a mobile medical outreach program, two small GDA projects and field support activities.  He/she will be assigned CTO responsibilities for several of these activities.  Program implementation includes working with both governmental and non-governmental actors in order to achieve program objectives.

In performing his/her duties, the incumbent will be expected to coordinate with mid and high level Armenian government officials, other donors, and local and international non-governmental organizations to achieve program objectives.  Frequent contact with Armenian counterparts, including government officials, medical facility staff, and medical education professionals is expected.

In particular, the incumbent will be responsible for the following:

A.	The Health Advisor has core management responsibility for the day-to-day activities on health system reform and improved service delivery within the health strategic objective of the DSRO.  Responsibilities will include but not be limited to:

2.

3.	As requested and under the direction of the Senior Health Advisor, DSRO Director, and/or Mission Management, the incumbent will negotiate health project assistance with host country counterparts, both non-governmental and governmental, including at the Ministerial level.  This may include coordination and exchanges of information on health reform in Armenia with the U.S. Embassy and the Office of the Coordinator (EUR/ACE) within the Department of State.

4.	The incumbent will oversee the implementation of USAID’s health sector portfolio. The incumbent will perform all required implementation and administrative duties related to the Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and activity manager roles. CTO responsibilities include conducting site visits, reviewing technical documents, reviewing public education materials, providing close supervision of funding pipelines, budgets, and funding requirements for the respective awards.  

5.	The incumbent will lead and coordinate the work of the respective implementing partners and technical assistance advisors.  The partners have their separate institutional expatriate and local professional teams.  The incumbent must ensure that the activities of the respective contractors and grantees are consistent with USAID’s health strategy, programmatic interests, and with the U.S. Government’s larger assistance strategy in the region.  

6.	The incumbent will monitor health reform activities to 1) ensure that performance monitoring systems are in place and that periodic, reliable measures/indicators of achievement of portfolio impact are established and 2) enhance the achievement of results by periodically reviewing development context, results indicators, and activity implementation progress, identifying problem areas and resolutions, as necessary.

7.	The incumbent will ensure that planned results are achieved in an efficient and timely manner, consistent with USAID regulations and policies.  This includes identifying and seeking resolution of issues affecting results achievement and managing programs through site visits and working with implementing organizations.  

8.	The incumbent will work with the Mission’s training coordinator to develop local, U.S. and third-country training and exchanges for Armenian counterparts working to improve healthcare in Armenia.

The Mission, counterparts, and customers will look to the incumbent to present viable and pertinent options to health reform issues.  

3.	The incumbent will identify problems and develop strategies for areas in which USAID and other donor intervention(s) could be useful and appropriate, taking into account the current needs of the Ministry of Health, medical facilities, local government, and citizens.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, and Small Disadvantage Business) relative to the NAICS Codes. 
Project Title: SAMHSA National Spending Estimates Project for Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment: # 270-06-0149 

Project Description:  CSAT /CMHS will continue to provide highly technical work in producing 10 year estimates of all national past expenditures, 10 year projections on future spending, and special cost and utilization reports--addressing all expenditures on public and private mental health services and substance abuse treatment (MH/SA). The methodology used to develop the estimates and projections will be parallel to those used previously under the Spending Estimates Project (i.e., National Expenditures on Mental Health Services and Substance Abuse Treatment, 1991 – 2001, DHHS Pub No. SMA-05-3999) and is produced to be comparable to the overall national expenditures that are produced by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  The SAMHSA spending estimates will also capture and segregate detailed additional MH/SA expenditures and MH/SA providers not included in the CMS National Health Accounts. 

The Spending Estimates Project requires specific, advanced technical capabilities and knowledge. The technical capabilities include: actuarial research and estimation, econometric techniques, projections and forecasting methods, ability to input missing information, understanding of surveys and sampling methodologies, experience with a wide array of large health data bases (both surveys and claims), detailed actuarial knowledge with the national health accounts, techniques for quality assurance, understanding of trend analysis, and sound judgment about data quality and usefulness. Technical capabilities also include a wide array of research techniques for special studies to improve the spending estimates and the ability to present technical materials in written and graphical form to non-technical audiences. In addition to these technical capabilities, national MH/SA policy expertise is necessary. Such knowledge must encompass a detailed understanding of mental health and substance abuse treatment services, spending, and financing; knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse (MHSA); as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing. 

To carry out this project the contractor shall accomplish the following: 

A)	Propose and implement a methodology for making 10 year spending estimates and for making 10 year projections that provide for continuity and consistency with previous sets of MH/SA estimates disseminated by SAMHSA. Each year, evaluate produced reports/articles and make recommendations prior to the next round of estimates or projections for improvements in the methodology that has been previously developed. Review of pertinent literature in methods, cost reporting and new or changed national databases is included. 

B)	Develop estimates for at least a ten-year period of national MH/SA spending that parallel the previous sets of MH/SA estimates undertaken by SAMHSA and are consistent with estimates of general health care spending produced by the CMS. This includes utilization of the same categories of payment and service type that are employed in the general CMS Health Accounts estimates. In addition, estimates for these categories should be further disaggregated by the type of MH/SA service and diagnosis (i.e., MH/SA, MH, SA, Alcohol and Drug Treatment). 

C)	Develop projections of future MH/SA spending across a 10 year period.  Forecasting methods available should be assessed for usefulness and blended methods used, if this would provide the best projections.  As the total time period of past estimates lengthens, increasingly sophisticated methods should be possible.

D)	Prepare a variety of special reports integrating financing policy concerns of the current mental health and substance abuse treatment literature and trends, highlighting policy relevant findings.  These special reports will explore cost, service utilization, special populations or other trends to further refine the spending estimates and to explore the factors that affect the trends in spending.
Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger).  In addition, a copy of the company capability statement will be accepted. Responses are due on February 9, 2006. The anticipated period of performance is a one year with four 1 year option periods. After review of the responses received a solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities around February 28, 2006.  
Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 
1.	Is your business a small business under the NAICS code? 
2.	Does your firm qualify as a small disadvantaged business? 
3.	If disadvantaged, specify if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? 
4.	Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 
5.	Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 
6.	Are you a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 
7.	Is your business a large business? 
8.	Describe in detail your proven capability and current in-house capacity in use of the national databases that are currently used for the National Expenditures report of the Spending Estimates, specifically: National Health Accounts National Hospital Discharge Survey, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Nursing Home Survey, National Home and Hospice Care Survey, Market Scan, IMS Health Inc. data, Medicaid drug rebate data, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide Inpatient Sample, National Medical Expenditure Survey, Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, Economic Census, Health Care and Social Assistance Sector, Alcohol and Drug Services Study (ADSS), Inventory/Survey of Mental Healthcare Organizations (SMHO), National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (NSSATS) / Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)
9.	Describe in detail your proven capability, including staff expertise in performing such tasks, using advanced methods that are: 1) statistical; 2) econometric; 3) actuarial.  Specifically address methods used in prior work under the Spending Estimates project, including:  determining trim points and use of methods to impute missing information, such as hot deck imputations, especially if related to specialty MH/SA data bases such as ADSS, UFDS and SMHO; actuarial estimation and forecasting, such as smoothing, adjusting bias or addressing definitional problems; econometric techniques, including pricing adjustments; complex statistical techniques to determine data reliability, such as in multivariate analysis to correct standard error.  
10.	Describe your proven capability and experience with the CMS National Health Account and its construction, especially actuarial or econometric modeling and/or adjustments in methods for additional desegregation of data to address special populations, age groups, etc.
11.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to forecast expenditures and provide trend analysis, to identify emerging or changing data sets, link information from many different large data sets, other methods to enhance data usefulness, advanced statistical programming in extremely large claims data sets, such as incorporation of negative claims and familiarity in MH/SA coding, exclusions and under coding.
12.	Describe your proven capability and current in-house capacity to demonstrate a detailed understanding of MH/SA spending, and financing; knowledge of the MH/SA data elements in health and MH/SA data sets and data gaps, knowledge of federal and state policies related to mental health and substance abuse (MHSA); success in peer reviewed publications and technical governmental reports; as well as a broad understanding of the U.S. health care system and its trends in practice patterns, spending, and financing.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), Technology Division, Force Protection (FP) Branch seeks to obtain market research information from sources capable of fully satisfying information from government, academia, and industry sources regarding novel solutions for lightweight body armor.  The immediate objective is to survey and assess the most advanced armor materials and armor material configurations addressing both torso and extremity protection.  A follow-on objective has been established to conduct performance testing of those armors and configurations assessed as offering the most promising solutions.   This market research is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for the proposed requirements. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and/or released to the public. The Government is primarily focused on seeking suitable commercial and non-developmental items or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. If no such commercial/non-developmental items currently exist, the Government may entertain the procurement of developmental items based on the information received as a result of this market research. Additionally, MCWL intends to evaluate the form and fit of potential solutions within weight restrictions, load dispe!  rsion, and comfort levels.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to establish an Informatics, Coordination and Service Center (ICSC) for the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs).  The ICSC will replace the functions of the Mutant Mouse Informatics Coordinating Center (ICC) currently funded at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME.  The ICSC will acquire all of the data from the current ICC and continue many of the previous functions as a central portal for the MMRRC program.  The ICSC will provide essential Informatics and coordinating services to the centers of the MMRRC and biomedical researchers.  These include a public website portal and Customer Service Center, to facilitate interactions with biomedical investigators, Informatics services, database activities, an archive of MMRRC documents and files, and coordination of requests to donate mouse strains to the MMRRC and order mouse strains from the MMRRC.  

Background Information:  The Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Centers (MMRRCs) http://www.mmrrc.org/index.html/ currently consists of five collaborating institutions functioning as a single, multi-site repository to acquire and distribute genetically-engineered laboratory mice for biomedical research.  The MMRRC program is supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services.  The purpose of this program is to ensure the continued availability of scientifically valuable, genetically engineered mice, and to distribute these mice to qualified researchers studying human diseases and normal biological processes.  This national network of regional breeding and distribution centers serves as a major repository of induced and spontaneous mutant mice.  The mission of the MMRRCs is to acquire, preserve, characterize, and distribute genetically-altered mice, and information describing their characteristics, utility and other features to qualified biomedical scientists and organizations for the purpose of supporting biomedical research.  Biomedical investigators and institutions are encouraged to donate mutant mouse strains to the MMRRC.  Strains are distributed to qualified biomedical investigators in the forms of frozen embryos, spermatozoa, Embryonic Stem (ES) cell lines, or living mice for noncommercial, academic research purposes only.  A fee is charged to the requesting investigator to partially compensate the repository center for the costs of shipping and replacing the animal germplasm.  As of 2005, a total of 11,300 mutant strains are maintained.  In calendar year 2004, a total of 1,318 requests for embryos, spermatozoa, ES cell lines and mice were received.  It is expected that new NIH initiatives will increase the number of submissions and requests for MMRRC mouse strains in the next few years.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness and response. The HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005 appointed the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) is responsible for the advanced development, establishment of surge capacity, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and antiviral drugs that may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP. ***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential influenza vaccine manufacturers capable of providing expanded domestic pandemic influenza vaccine capacity using egg-based vaccine products. Additionally, there is further interest in identifying potential influenza vaccine manufacturers with active pandemic influenza vaccine programs using recombinant-based approaches and committed to U.S.-based manufacturing and licensure.

The current domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is approximately 180 million doses at 15 ug HA per dose in nine (9) months using inactivated, egg-based vaccines. In order to achieve a goal of 600 million monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines doses manufactured in six (6) months, significant increases in surge capacity must be afforded by expanding existing egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities, erecting new influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities utilizing egg-based technologies as available and converting existing manufacturing facilities that produce FDA-licensed vaccines and biologics to influenza vaccines. Further to this end, advanced development of recombinant-based influenza vaccines towards U.S.-based manufacturing and licensure needs to accompany the HHS support of advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines.  

Interested organizations that have potential candidate facilities, plans for facilities, or vaccine candidates are invited to submit a statement of capability, facility or product description, and development status to HHS/OPHEP/ORDC.
Specifically, submitted information depending upon the stage of facility should provide  the following: (1) U.S. facility location and description (i.e. sq. ft., systems, equipment, etc.); (2) a description of the facility’s potential pandemic influenza vaccine product yield and capacity (i.e. number of monovalent doses in six months following receipt of pandemic virus isolate or nucleotide sequence); (3) a description of the vaccine manufacturing process and biocontainment capability including waste products; and (4) a description of milestones, timelines, and cost estimates for the design, renovation (if applicable), construction, commissioning, and validation of the facility to address the urgency of a possible pandemic in the near future. 

Similarly, submitted information depending on the stage of recombinant influenza vaccine development should provide the following: (1) a description of the recombinant vaccine product and comparability to existing influenza vaccines; (2) description of the manufacturing process and lot release product assays; (3) results of preclinical and/or clinical studies; (4) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; (5) regulatory pathway, limitations, and possible obstacles; (6) an estimate of production capacity, U.S. manufacturing sites, and timelines and estimated retail costs; and (7) intellectual property accessibility. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

A pre-solicitation meeting of interested companies will be scheduled at 10:30am to 12:00pm EST on February 7, 2006 in the Humphrey Building of the HHS located at 200 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, D.C. 20201. Information from the meeting will be posted on the website www.Fedbizopps.gov. Advance registration is required to attend the meeting. There is a limit of two attendees per organization. Email name of attendee, organization name, and telephone number to darrick.early@hhs.gov.

Information must be submitted by 3:00 PM, EST, February 21, 2006. Responses to the facility or recombinant product requests should be limited to 25 pages in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick (Andre) Early, Contract Specialist, phone 202-205-5668, email address: darrick.early@hhs.gov. If information is sent by courier or mail service, please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

<DESC>BRAC- McPherson Augmentation Contract (B-MAC) Sources Sought Synopsis W911SE-06-BMAC 	The Army Contracting Agency Southern Region Contracting Center East (ACA-SRCC-E) is conducting market research to identify potential qualified Small Business sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience necessary to meet the Army requi rements necessary for providing Manpower Support Services.  The Government is particularly interested in finding qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, but all small businesses are encouraged to respond to this synopsis. Tenant Activiti es on Fort McPherson and Fort Gillem are under a statutory directive to relocate their organizations to various other installations. These tenant activities are: United States Forces Command, (FORSCOM), First U.S. Army, Third U.S. Army, Installation Manage ment Activity Southeast Region Office (SERO), the 52nd Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit, the Southern Region Contracting Center- East (SRCC-E), and the United States Army Reserve Command (USARC). Tenant Activities are currently expected to initiate a nd perform BRAC-specific functions as well as their traditional core functions during base re-alignment. While increased workloads on these staffs are expected to implement base re-alignment, it is also expected that temporary personnel vacancies will occu r. These personnel vacancies are due to reductions in the number of Military and Civilian workers available during transition: Military personnel are expected to make a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to leave Fort McPherson/Gillem with their replacement s arriving at the new Tenant Activity installations; Some federal employees may retire earlier than normal to avoid leaving the Atlanta area, or will transfer to the new installation.  Once federal employees have retired or transferred, we anticipate the p ermanent federal employee replacements will be hired at the new gaining installation and not here at Ft. McPherson/Gillem to reduce PCS costs. It is our intent to solicit, from prospective vendors, qualified contractor personnel to augment staffs to implem ent BRAC activities while Tenant Activities re-locate.  	The scope of the required services may include, but are not limited to, the management and/or execution of the following functions of the Tenant Activities: Personnel & Human Resources, Intelligence, Operations, Logistics, Public Relations, Host Nation Pl anning/Civil Affairs, Information Technology & Automation, Construction Planning and Management, Resource Management & Finance, Communications (non-intelligence gathering), Leisure Activity planning, Family Support Group assistance, Medical, Legal, Facilit y/Installation & Operations Security, Installation Public Works, Contract Management, and Transportation Management Functions.  Some functions are inherently governmental and will be excluded from this requirement (for example; Contracting Officer and Budg et Officer). Security clearances will be specified on each individual task order and it is anticipated that most of the personnel required by this requirement will have an active or pending SECRET security clearance. Some positions may require TOP SECRET c learances.  The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey. Small businesses are highly encouraged to participate in this survey. The applicable NAICS Code is 541330 ($25 million small bus iness size standard).   Small business responses will be evaluated to determine whether small business has the technical and financial capability to perform the services described above as a small business set-aside.  Responses to this survey are due prior  to close of business Friday, 17 February 2006 via email to ACA-SRCCE-BMAC@forscom.army.mil . The survey can be found at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_view.cfm?psolicitationnbr=W911SE06BMAC. If additional information is needed, contact Ron nell Book er at 404-464-0907.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

For purposes of this solicitation the NCIAS Code is 561730.  The SIC Code is 0782,0783.

 The small business size standard is average annual receipts over the last three years of $6 Million or less.

In addition to price, the Government will consider other factors in selecting the contractor for award.  Other factors to be considered will be past performance, the vendor’s capability to perform the required services, the vendor’s present staff, and staffing plan for additional employees and/or subcontractors.

STATEMENT OF WORK

The contractor shall furnish all the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities to perform the Statement of Work (SOW) specifications as described herein.  Lawns are generally 1/5 to ½ acre, but this includes yards up to and including one (1) acre.  Services will be performed only when assigned by the Contracting Officer. The mowing season will generally begin approximately April 1 or April 15, as directed by the Local Office.  Mowings will generally be twice per month after mowing begins on a specific property.  Properties disposed of by Rural Development will be removed from the mowing cycle.  Rural Development may also stop mowing specific properties by giving notice to the contractor.

 For all items below, trimming must be done by a mechanical device such as a “weed wacker”, “string trimmer”, etc.  Chemicals such as herbicides, or other similar materials may not be used. 

It is generally left to the discretion of the contractor to establish the exact mowing dates for the semi-monthly mowing schedule.  Lawns shall generally be mowed within 1 or 2 days of the established semi-monthly mowing cycle.  However, the Government may direct any of the following services to be performed on a certain day, or within a timeframe of 2 or 3 days.  If so directed, this will normally be done to give the best property appearance for a foreclosure sale.  In those cases the contractor must provide the special mowing as directed, at the same prices as quoted.  The Government will normally give at least 5 days advance notice of a special mowing date.

It is anticipated that some hidden foreign objects may be present in the lawn.  The Government is not responsible for any damages caused by foreign objects.  The contractor is responsible for removing and properly disposing of foreign objects.


01.	LAWN MAINTENANCE SERVICE – FIRST MOWING
It is anticipated that the grass will be higher than normal for the first mowing.  Properties will be mowed, raked, and all clippings removed and properly disposed of.  Border area around the dwelling walls, driveways, posts, trees and shrubs will be trimmed as part of the work under this line item.  

It is anticipated that debris such as leaves, tree limbs, paper, plastic, and other items will have accumulated in the off season.  The contractor is responsible for removal and proper disposal of these items.

02.	 LAWN MAINTENANCE SERVICE – REGULAR MOWING
During applicable months, the contractor will mow and rake each lawn and remove clippings from the property as appropriate.  The mowings shall be at regularly spaced intervals not to exceed twice per month on any one property.  Border area around the dwelling walls, driveways, posts, trees and shrubs will be trimmed with each mowing.  All debris and foreign items shall be properly disposed of.  Clippings shall be removed if they show a noticeable residue on the lawn.  Clipping residue shall always be removed from paved surfaces, driveways, and flower beds.

NOTE:  During dry weather months or late fall, the mowings may be reduced to every three weeks, or one per month and in the early spring, the mowings may be more frequent.  Any change from the twice per month schedule will be given to the contractor in writing by either the Contracting Officer and/or the program personnel at the Local Office specified in the block entitled Consignee on the first page of this purchase order.

03.	LAWN MAINTENANCE SERVICE – BUSH HOGGING
The Contractor will bush hog or otherwise mow properties where the grass has exceeded two (2) feet in height.  Border area around the dwelling walls, driveways, posts, trees and shrubs will be trimmed.  After property has been bush hogged and trimmed, the contractor will rake the entire yard and haul cut grass away and properly dispose of cut grass, debris, and any foreign items.  


ESTIMATED QUANTITY
The Quantities in the Purchase Order are estimated amounts only.  The Estimated number of mowings and estimated amount of this order do however represent a ceiling amount which may not be exceeded without the Contracting Officer issuing a formal written modification to this order and obligating additional funding.  The estimated quantities and funding amounts for each item may only be used for properties in those specific fund categories and time periods.  Neither the estimated quantities nor the funding may be exceeded without the Contacting Officer issuing a formal written modification to this purchase order.  The number of mowings required by the Government is dependent on the number of properties requiring service, and the weather.  Specific authorization to mow specific properties at specific times, or temporary directives to suspend mowings because of dry weather, or any other reason will be provided to the contractor by either the Contracting Officer, or by program personnel at the Local Office specified in the block entitled Consignee on the first page of this purchase order.  Similarly, either the Contracting Officer and/or the program personnel at the Local Office specified in the block entitled Consignee on the first page of this purchase order may discontinue mowing service at any or all properties because of properties moving out of the Government’s inventory, or for any other reason, and the contractor shall not be entitled for any payment for services not rendered, including anticipatory profits, overheads, personnel costs, or any and all similar costs.

INVOICES
The contractor shall submit one consolidated invoice per month for all mowings that were completed during the month.  Submission by the contractor, of invoices more frequently than monthly is not permitted.  

FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract
(a)	The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor on or before September 30, 2004 provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 3 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
(b)	If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
(c)	The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause shall not exceed November 15, 2004.
(d)	Placing of the above notices in the U.S. Postal Service Mail by the Contracting Officer shall be deemed to be providing the contractor with the required written notice.

FAR 52.232-19  Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year
Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2005.  The Government’s obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2005, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Water and Sanitation Advisor is an integral part of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Health Team. OFDA addresses all disaster health risks with a strong focus on identifying and managing health risks in complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs). In natural and complex emergencies, excess mortality results from malnutrition, malaria, measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. HIV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to excess mortality in disasters. These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (children under five years of age, the elderly, and women). The team provides technical assistance to OFDA including assessments, proposal reviews, risk management, capacity building and technical innovations to address the major causes of excess morbidity and mortality.  OFDA's water and sanitation interventions include rehabilitation and/or drilling of water sources, water catchment systems, funding for training on diarrheal disease prevention and treatment, sanitation intervention (latrines), hygiene promotion on water and sanitation issues. 

Introduction

OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within the DRM Division and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include the Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Water and Sanitation Advisor is part of the Health Team in TAG.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 Second Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20593, Telephone:   (202) 267-2285, FAX: (202) 267-4011.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  The Contractor shall re-fuel Juneau, Alaska mountain top high sites with propane.  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  This National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks at a site are at maximum capacity or fuel gauge reads between 80-85%.  A typical tank is filled to maximum capacity between 80-85%.  Fuel quantity estimate is conservative and already adjusted for the seasonal temperature changes and altitude. All sites should be filled to capacity, if fuel is delivered within required timeframes.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative within one week of work completion.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to remove reference to a Past Performance Questionaire.  Quoters are not required to submit past performance information with their quotations for this solicitation.  The Army will obtain past performance information through other means.  All relevant changes are incorporated into the description below. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the purchase of commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional infor mation included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W911S8-06-Q-0003 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotations. The  solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08 and DCN 20051220. This requirement is totally set-aside for small business concerns with a NAICS Code of 335129 and a corresponding size standard of 500 employees. The description of the commercial item is for portable light tower systems and replacement light bulbs, all of new manufacture, and reads as follows: CLIN 0001, 26 EACH, PORTABLE LIGHT TOWER SYSTEMS.

The selection resulting from this request for quotations will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable quot e from a responsible quoter with acceptable or neutral past performance.  Quoters are not required to submit past performance information with their quotations.  The Contracting Officer will utilize other means to determine acceptability of quoters' past p erformance. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using a SF 1449. A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order. Provision 52.212-1, Instructio ns to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted. Wherever the words 'offer', 'proposal', 'offerors', or similar terms are used in this so licitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean 'quote', 'quotation', 'quoter', 'vendor' or similar corresponding term to eflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. Local Fort L ewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition. Local clause 52 .111-4131 states: 'Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates  in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to For t Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbou nd commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, c ommercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on  post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall n otify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet-5 inche s clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. 'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is ove r 12 feet-5 inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tie r, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protecti on Level Charlie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must  have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lan es will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts  Out Gate. The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.' Local clause 52.111-4132 states: 'a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obta in either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week. Con tractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gat e when the Logistics Center Gate is closed). The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC ), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC an d issuing the fast access identification card. If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for bein g issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or n o longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the con tractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification  badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor. Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract. d. Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees. If an employees ide ntification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report o f the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e. Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract. The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s). The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the c ontract for which it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Ac t (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identifi cation cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.' ADDENDUM TO CLAUSES 52.111-4131, 52.111-4132, AND 52.111-4133: Employees who require access to Fort Lewis to perform work under this co ntract may obtain a Government sponsored identification badge.
