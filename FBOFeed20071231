<DESC>USAID/Ethiopia announces its intention to invite comments and suggestions on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the implementation of the USAID/ETHIOPIA Urban Agriculture Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children. This new Urban Agriculture Program for HIV/AIDS Affected Women & Children is designed to improve the nutritional status and food security of households affected by or living with HIV/AIDS. This activity focuses on services to expand urban agriculture opportunities for low income HIV/AIDS-affected households, particularly those headed by females and orphans.

Through this activity, beneficiaries are expected to acquire the skills and means to enable them to:  increase food production; enhance household food availability; promote consumption of a balanced nutritious diet; improve family income through the sale of food surplus; and realize alternative livelihoods. By building on experience to date, this activity will expand areas where urban agriculture support for HIV-affected households and OVC are available and increase the number of beneficiaries.  

Four components are envisioned: 1) Technical and Other Support of Urban Agriculture for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and OVC; 2) Building Capacity of Local Non-Government Organizations; 3) Strengthening Food and Income Generation Linkages with Care and Treatment Networks; and 4) Management and Evaluation Information Systems. Implementation is expected to include partnerships with on-going efforts to support OVC, community-based palliative care and treatment programs, and HIV counseling and testing outreach services. Success in undertaking the components of the Project is defined as having created new food security options and additional income-generating opportunities for PLWHA and their families. Measurement of that success must be evidence-based.   

The final version of the Request for Proposals (RFP) may be issued in early March 2008. USAID/Ethiopia invites comments and suggestions on the attached draft SOW. Firms, organizations, and individuals eligible to compete, experts in the area of nutrition and food security, HIV/AIDS, and micro-enterprise activities and other interested parties are strongly encouraged to review and comment on the draft and to consider submitting a Proposal in response to the resulting RFP. The purpose of posting this draft is to enhance the quality of the SOW. Comments and suggestions received may be considered as the RFP is finalized. USAID reserves the rights to incorporate suggestions and comments and/or to reject suggestions and comments on the draft SOW.

Specialization in areas of Tax Models, Revenue Estimation and Statistics of Income are in high demand.  Certain assignments require candidates to have significant project management experience, to include the ability to prepare project work plans, statements of work and manage human resources.  Prior foreign technical assistance work and knowledge of a foreign language are highly desirable, but not required.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure as a sole source the brand name Cytek xP5 Color Upgrade for 3-color Facscan, FlowJo Collector Edition Upgrade to Pentium Class PC, which includes installation and training.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.501. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  Contractor shall provide one (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, on January 14, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed or emailed to: Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  It is the vendors? responsibility to ensure all questions have been received in the contracting office.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference: NCI-80022-MM on all correspondence. 

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) has a need for the aforementioned piece of equipment in order to use two (2) additional fluorescent emission channels on an upgraded FACSCAN machine.  This will save the POB both time and money on their pediatric cancer research.

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority: 13.106-1 (b) 

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 


Justification:  
In order to use 2 additional fluorescent emission channels on our upgraded FacScan Machine, we are in need of an upgrade. The Cytek upgrade and additional fees are provided solely and expertly by Cytek, Inc.  This is a highly complex upgrade kit and requires specialized flow cytometry knowledge which only few companies have. Most other companies who have this specialized knowledge have original equipment for sale, therefore creating an upgrade for other manufacturers equipment would compete with the sales of their equipment. The manufacturer (BD Biosciences) does not offer this upgrade because it is more profitable for them to sell a new piece of equipment.  Also, we are constantly upgrading the Facscan with the newest versions of the software and hardware. These new pieces require fine-tuning, which is more cost effective if done as part of the service contract from Cytek. 

This item and service is unique because (1) We have a Facscan and a need to do studies using APC and APC tandem fleurochromes, (2) In order to perform these studies on a Facscan, we must have the Cytek XP5 upgrade, and (3)  there is no other way to perform APC and APC tandem studies using our existing equipment.

Drs. Remy Bosselut and Dr. Nevil Singh, both in the NCI, have purchased this upgrade.  There are no compatibility issues.

The contractor shall provide: (1) xP5 color upgrade for 3-color FacScan, (2) warranty, (3) free shipping and delivery, and (4) upgrade to a Pentium Class PC that will allow us to run the software

It is critical to the smooth operation and research of the NCI/CCR that the equipment continue to be calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer?s specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could jeopardize the use of the aforementioned systems.   The internal components and mechanisms of this instrument are proprietary and Cytek Inc is the only known source capable of fulfilling the service contract on these instruments.  


The following salient characteristics apply:

-      Spatially separated excitation beams; 488 and 647nm

-        25mW 637 laser

-        Addition of two detectors (APC and APC/CY-7) 

-        Uses Cellquest or Cellquest Pro and Cytek?s Rainbow software for acquisition

-        Uses fiber optics to deliver fluorescent emissions from the red laser

-        Uses Peak sense and hold electronic signal and not time delay electronics

-        Has Hardware compensation in Rainbow software

-        Unless user launches Rainbow software Facscan runs the standard 3-color single laser system

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Information Technology, E-Commerce, and Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4) intends to modify the Radio Frequency Identification - II (RFID-II) Contract DABL01-03-D-1002 to Savi Technology to extend the ordering period for supplies and services  for one year to 31 January 2009 and to raise the ceiling of the contract from $424,500,000 to $483,040,400 in accordance with J&A No. 07-065 approved on 26 December 2007.  The extension of the ordering period and raising of the contract ceiling is necessa ry in order to continue to provide active RFID tags and associated supplies and services for shipments of materiel to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The requirements of the Active RFID technology include a family of read/write tags  with memory size up to 128 Kbytes, omnidirectional read and write distance of 300 feet, operation at a frequency that is approved for use in as many countries and locations as possible, RF emissions at a level so that Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation for Ordnance (HERO) Certification can be attained, and compliance with the International Committee for Information Technology Standardization (INCITS) 256-2001 standard.  The extension will also allow the Department of Defense and industry to prepare to mi grate to an open, non-proprietary standards-based RFID infrastructure. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested pers ons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under  an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the di scretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Arkansas is seeking qualified firms to provide real estate appraisal services throughout the state.  Appraisals are required for the purchase of conservation easements under the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), the Healthy Forests Reserve Program (HFRP), and the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP).  The purpose of the appraisal is to provide an opinion of market value of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value.  The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised.  What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  Appraisals shall comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisals Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.

The contract(s) will be for a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract(s), competitively negotiated, not to exceed $500,000.  Any contract resulting from this solicitation will have a one year base period from date of award, with a possible four one year renewal option period(s).  One or more contract(s) will be awarded to the offeror(s) whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is considered the best value to the Government, all factors considered.  .

To be considered for award, appraisers must be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser in Arkansas and provide a copy of his/her license/credential.  All appraisals obtained through this contract must comply with USPAP, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA courses shall be provide by the review appraiser to the Contracting Officer.  

Also, to be considered for award, the proposing firm must have an office located within the State of Arkansas, or within 100 miles of an Arkansas border.  A quick response is required to meet program deadlines and failure to provide a quick response could jeopardize Arkansas NRCS programs.

This procurement is 100% set-aside for small business.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard of $2 million will be used.  

The following evaluation factors will be used to evaluate offers for award, and are listed in descending order of importance.  1) Past Performance, including timeliness and quality of work; 2) Capacity to accomplish work, including evaluation of staff appraisers and subcontractors; and 3)  Technical Competence/Experience.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are approximately equal to cost or price.

For planning purposes, the Government anticipates approximately 40 appraisals to be completed for the base year and each renewal year.  The Government reserves the right to award more than one contract for a period of up to one year after the proposal due date.  Proposal prices are effective for 90 days from the proposal due date, unless extended by the offeror.

Technical reviews will be conducted on the first appraisal of each fiscal year, and on approximately 10 percent of all subsequent appraisals completed by each individual appraiser.  

Interested vendors may download the solicitation when posted on FedBizOpps, and respond to the due date on the solicitation.  The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on or about January 22, 2007.  This procurement is being solicited subject to availability of funds.

<DESC>This announcement solicits White Papers, of not more than five (5) pages in length for specific topics of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program, Operational Safety and Engineering Research (OSER). For your information, the MMS web site has descriptions of OSER activities, the scope of MMS interests, and past projects. The web site address is: http://www.mms.gov/tarphome/index.htm. BACKGROUND: Research sponsored by MMS through the TA&R Program is used to acquire basic engineering information needed to oversee the orderly development of offshore oil and gas operations. New challenges and informational needs arise as companies use new equipment or procedures based on technological changes or as operations expand into new or different environments such as the deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). The principal objective of this request for White Papers is to address innovative or technological advancements among topics of current interest to MMS. As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Projects selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2008 funds.  The MMS anticipates a total of approximately $ 500,000 being available for the initiation of new research proposals addressing OSER topics in FY 2008 with projects being identified through this announcement. NOTICE: MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review. Potential contractors should let MMS know if they do not want the White Papers/proposals shared. Contractors should plan to gather data from an external source for these projects, where applicable, as only limited data may be available from the MMS. OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2008 OSER activities include ONLY research on the following 5 topics:   1.    The Impact of Marine Growth on Pipeline Risers for Floating Facilities       Desired Outcome is to answer the following:  How does marine growth affect pipeline riser performance in terms of stress and fatigue? How is marine growth accounted for in pipeline riser design including anti-fouling coatings and growth tolerance levels?  What inspection programs are being performed?  What cleaning programs are being performed?  How does marine growth predicted in the design compare to actual in-service experience?   Provide recommendations for improvement to standard industry practice on combating marine growth on pipeline risers.      Reason for Research:  Marine growth has been identified as being one of the most addressed issues resulting from the pipeline riser verification (CVA) program.  Marine growth has also contributed to the failure of pipeline riser flex joints in some of the first steel Catenary Risers and Top Tension Risers installed in the Gulf of Mexico.  A better understanding of marine growth is essential to formulating effective policy and mitigations in the pipeline approval process. A possible optional additional task may be to look at marine growth on mooring components / lines and also on ship shaped vessels (ex. Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessels) to determine how marine growth would affect the speed they can travel when trying to out run a hurricane.  This is secondary to the riser issue and may be addressed as an optional task. 2.    Design Qualification Testing Requirement for High Pressure/High Temperature (HPHT) Equipment.  Desired Outcome: MMS would like to get an additional recommendation on the design qualification testing, done under the load conditions that the equipment will see in service for newly designed equipment. This type of design qualification testing will need to consider temperature and pressure cycling and fatigue testing.  Reason for Research: The MMS issued a Notice to Lessees (NTL No. 2007-G07) "High Pressure and High Temperature Completions and Workovers".  This NTL was written for Workover and Completion equipment with a pressure rating greater than 15,000 psig and or a temperature rating greater than 350 degrees F.  In this NTL we state: (Operating Company) "Provide a discussion of how you have determined that the completion or workover equipment is qualified fit for service. This equipment includes wellheads, tubing heads, tubulars, packers, surface-controlled subsurface safety valves, threaded connections, seals, seal assemblies, production trees, chokes, and any other equipment that will be exposed to the reservoir pressure and/or temperature." Although the committee for API RP 6HP is expected to make recommendations in the new recommended practice for design qualification testing of HPHT equipment; MMS would like an additional recommendation.  The testing for HPHT equipment is very costly and facilities may not exist yet to do some of this work.  3.	Evaluation of High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS) Desired Outcome: Many HIPPS configurations and control schemes exist.  Specific areas of concern are HIPPS valve leakage rate requirements, HIPPS valve response time, material selection (especially in the presence of H2S), length of the fortified section immediately downstream of the HIPPS, determination of the ?weak section? (a concern has been raised that because of the extreme water depths, it may be difficult for the pipeline to be designed to a higher pressure rating than the riser).  International standards and current applications should be assessed and recommendations on regulation for the Gulf of Mexico should be proposed. Reason for Research: API 17O (HIPPS) is currently in the developmental phase.  HIPPS systems are being viewed as critical to future deepwater development, but experience with these systems in the Gulf of Mexico does not exist.  While the systems may become necessary due to pipeline size and weight, there is a significant amount of risk involved because of the high pressure, high flow rate deepwater wells.  MMS needs to gain a better understanding of the implications of timing, testing, material selection, etc in order to justify regulatory requirements.  4.	High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) Elastomer Evaluation Desired Outcome: Elastomers that will not deteriorate or losing sealing capabilities at flowing temperatures greater than 350F and in H2S service have been identified as one of the critical gaps in HPHT technology.  MMS needs a review of current and future technology to determine if any suitable elastomers exist or are in the works.  From that list, tests should be conducted to prove the suggested technology. Justification: Without elastomeric seals in the subsea wellhead, BOP, valves, etc, HPHT technology will not be able to advance.  MMS would like to see proof that new designs will function properly.   5.	Subsea Blow Out Preventer (BOP) Pressure Tests in Deepwater: Desired Outcome: Address the risks and issues of  A and B:  Also, does an improved method for testing HP subsea BOPs exist? A.  The internal yield stress limit of a BOP is independent of the external hydrostatic pressure for a subsea BOP (thick wall vessels).  It does not mater how deep the subsea BOP is set, an internal pressure greater than the design pressure for the BOP at the surface can?t be applied.  If you do, then the cyclic fatigue life could be reduced significantly because you are applying an internal pressure greater than the yield stress limits set in the ASME Section 8 Div 2 Boiler Code. B.  At the same time that you are keeping within the limits of the yield stress in the BOP, you are testing the internal sealing elements (pipe rams, blind rams, annular preventers) inside the BOP to significantly lower values than the equipment was designed for at the surface. This is acceptable as long as you do not have a gas kick that gets into the riser before the BOP's are closed.  In this case, the differential pressure across the sealing elements, during an actual gas kick, could be greater than the tested differential pressure. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The MMS is interested in research initiatives relative to safety practices for offshore operations. As a result of the review of the White Papers, proposals will be sought and evaluated for funding. Efforts to be considered should address the above stated issues. HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, one (1) original, PLUS four (4) copies and one (1) electronic copy in .PDF format, on a CD shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Olivia Adrian, not later than January 31, 2008, by 05:00 PM, ET.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: 674-08-0006.

ISSUANCE DATE: December 21, 2007.

CLOSING DATE AND TIME: January 16, 2008, 17:00 Local Time, Pretoria, South Africa.

POSITION TITLE: Regional Food for Peace Program Officer for Southern Africa.

MARKET VALUE: The position is classified as a GS-13 (salary range: $66,951 - $87,039) or GS-14 ($79,115- $102,848) level. Final compensation will be based on the individual??s salary and work history, experience and educational background. The basic duties and responsibilities do not change between the GS 13 and GS 14 levels; however, the USAID/SA expects the employee meeting the qualifications for GS 14 and hired at that level to exercise a higher level of autonomy and to require less supervision. 

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Two (2) years or exercising an option to extend will depend on continuing need of services, availability of funds, and satisfactory performance. 

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pretoria, South Africa with frequent travel in the region as stated in the position description.

SECURITY ACCESS: Secret.

AREA OF CONSIDERATION: U.S. Citizens only.

I. SCOPE OF WORK 

 A. Introduction:

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP), as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) within USAID, is responsible for providing food aid and related food security assistance resources, as authorized under Public Law 480 (PL480). The Regional FFP Office in Pretoria covers Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, that are either currently receiving, or at risk of food insecurity requiring PL480 food aid assistance. Only two Mozambique and Zimbabwe have full-time in-country FFP Officers managing these programs. The Regional FFP Office provides both support to USAID Missions in managing FFP-funded activities, as well as direct management in non-presence countries (Lesotho and Swaziland). 

B. Program and Position Overview:

FFP requires the services of a Regional Food for Peace Officer (FFP/PSC), to ensure effective management of FFP resources in the region, and achievement of regional food security objectives, to include strategic analysis, coordination of food aid assistance activities, monitoring and reporting on FFP-funded activities, food security and food aid needs assessments, for USAID staff involved managing FFP-funded regional activities. The Regional FFP/PSC will daily report directly to the Pretoria-based FFP/FSO or his/her designee. However, the FFP/PSC will maintain direct relationships with, and receive direct guidance from, FFP/W, USAID Mission and other USAID staff, as appropriate, including Mission Directors, the FFP Director, and/or relevant FFP Country Backstop Officers. 

The FFPO PSC will actively oversee food aid assistance activities, and provide support, mentoring and training to USAID Missions and implementing partners (including UN and NGO agencies) in developing and coordinating food aid plans in line with FFP??s Strategic framework. This includes activities that respond to immediate acute food aid needs of vulnerable populations, promote their food security recovery and address underlying factors that impede their resilience to food-related shocks. This position requires regional travel of 50% to 70%. Travel to countries outside the Southern Africa Region may occur on very short notice or for extended periods.

C. Specific Duties and Responsibilities:

i)	Program Monitoring and Evaluation ?V Incumbent is required to:

1.	Travel (subject to Embassy clearance) throughout the region on a regular basis to monitor the implementation of DCHA/FFP??s Title II activities, identify and assist in the resolution of operational issues, and to identify broader coordination, planning and policy issues that need to be taken to a higher level. 

2.	Work in closely with Country Teams regularly concerning a wide range of implementation issues relating to the use of Title II food aid resources, especially the use and management of Title II resources by NGOs, and the integration of USAID resources.

3.	Monitor and update food requirements and inputs, including pledges and commitments from other donors.

4.	Continually assess the effectiveness of food aid program results, participate as member of UN or other assessment teams to ascertain the form or appropriateness of the international humanitarian response.

5.	Ensure full reporting by WFP and Title II grantees for commodity deliveries and utilization; provide follow-up appropriately for any commodity losses and technical guidance for avoidance of losses. Immediately report diversions of Title II commodities to DCHA/FFP, RFFPO and Missions

6.	For specific emergencies, ensure that appropriate food security assessments are conducted so that proper and efficient food relief activities may be designed and implemented by International Organizations (IOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and in close collaboration with other humanitarian assistance, to assure food aid objectives are met.

7.	Coordinate with field representatives from the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (STATE/PRM) concerning U.S Government food aid support for refugees as requested by the United Nations, WFP, or other multilateral agencies. 

8.	Support the development and management of a regional tracking system for Title II food commodities, providing DCHA/FFP with monthly pipeline reports.

9.	Provide appropriate technical assistance to the U.S. Embassy on the implementation of programs supported by the United States Department of Agriculture under its Food for Progress program, or other food aid programs.

ii)	Coordination with other USG, NGO and International Agencies ?V Incumbent is required to:

a.	Coordinate with USG country teams in the region (USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, and/or other USG staff in-country), Host Country Government, NGOs, IOs, and donors to reach agreement on program concerns related to refugee, IDP, or resident food aid requirements and constraints to food aid deliveries.

b.	Liaise with the World Food Program (WFP) to coordinate its food assistance programs with any Title II activities implemented through NGOs and managed by the USAID Mission. Monitor USAID contributions to and program progress by implementing partners. Serve as an advisor to Missions in the region on issues concerning WFP Protracted Relief and Recovery Operations (PRROs) or Emergency Operations (EMOPs), and/or NGO programs.

c.	Maintain liaison with IO/NGO representatives to keep them fully informed about Food for Peace's food assistance policies and procedures, and to discuss and resolve mutual problems regarding port operations. 

d.	Review draft Title II assistance proposals provided by NGOs or IOs before submission to DCHA/FFP, to ensure that: 1) proposals are complete according to FFP Proposal Guidelines; 2) the proposed uses of food aid are appropriate for the assessed food security situation; and 3) the proposed internal transport, storage and handling (ITSH) and 202(e) costs are allocable, reasonable and appropriate for Title II funding.

e.	Represent USAID/DCHA/FFP at meetings with other U.S. Government agencies, NGOs, IOs, and with other donors on matters related to food aid and P.L. 480 Title II program effectiveness, except communications that reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision (DCHA/FFP clearance required) and the affected Missions.

f.	Participate in planning exercises with the Missions, Africa Bureau, DCHA/FFP, DCHA/OFDA, and other relevant USAID offices for programs that involve the use of food aid.

g.	Prepare and deliver briefings and status reports to senior officials of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Ambassador and USAID Mission Director. 

At most times the work is sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.

A.  INTRODUCTION
The mission of the DHS Office of Policy is to strengthen homeland security by developing and coordinating Department-wide policies, planning, and programs in order to better coordinate/integrate the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in areas such as prevention, protection, response and recovery. 

B. BACKGROUND
The Office meets this mission by:
1. Acting as lead coordinator of Department-wide policies, programs, and planning which ensure consistency and integration of missions throughout the entire Department.
2. Providing a central office to develop and communicate policies across multiple components of the homeland security network and strengthening the Departments ability to maintain policy and operational readiness needed to protect the homeland.
3. Providing the foundation and direction for Department-wide strategic planning and budget priorities.
4. Bridging multiple headquarters components and operating agencies to improve communication among DHS entities, eliminate duplication of effort, and translate policies into timely action.
5. Creating a single point of contact for internal and external stakeholders that will allow for streamlined policy management for the Department.

C. SCOPE 
DHS seeks a contractor to support the drafting and reviewing of DHS plans, policies, directives and standard operating procedures.  The Office of Policy requires innovative, industry critical thinkers to support the coordination and integration of high level policy decisions.  As DHS moves towards a more aggressive approach to offering new, creative threat reduction options to the prevention of bio-vulnerabilities, such as Pandemic Flu, tainted import products, etc.; in depth assessment is required.  DHS conducts scientific research and works with the broader scientific community to protect against agro-terrorism and has the responsibility of inspecting animals and foods imported into the United States. DHS has authority to implement the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act), which is intended to encourage the development, manufacturing, and use of protective technology and services, by providing limited immunity from liability for vendors and buyers of certified products or services.  To assist DHS with the vast amount of material, policies, etc. in depth assessment is required to support Departmental policy management through analyzing the Departments relationships with industry, other national security agencies, as well as foreign governments within the context of DHS mission-related aspects, e.g., creative threat reduction options previously mentioned.  These tasks will require technical expertise in these areas that will support the expertise within DHS.  A Subject Matter Expert (SME) will be of use in providing technical information on such critical issues as they relate to Bioterrorism and Threat Reduction.  Training is also needed in not only addressing the Agencys relationships with other organizational entities, as it relates to Bioterrorism and Threat Reduction, but to the Agencys mission as a whole.

N.   EVALUATION FACTORS
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  The Government does reserve the right to make multiple awards. The non-price evaluation factors are Technical Approach & Methodology, Key Personnel Qualifications, and Past Performance.   Technical Approach & Understanding are more important than Key Personnel Qualifications and when combined both are more important than Past Performance.  When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoters best terms.

There is one line item for use in preparing the price portion of the proposal and is as follows:  Line Item:  0001; Description:  Feasibility Study; Quantity:  1; Unit of Issue:  Lump Sum; Total Price: _______. 2.  PROJECT INFORMATION: A Feasibility Study has been initiated to develop and evaluate alternative long term plans that address the problems at the Emsworth, river mile 6.2, Dashields, river mile 13.3, and Montgomery, river mile 31.7, locks and dams, hereafter referred to as EDM, on the Ohio River.  The alte rnatives include projects that replace the 360 x 56 auxiliary locks with new 600 x 110 locks, 1200 x 110 locks of the size found at all other projects on the Ohio River, 720 x 110 locks equal in size to the nearby L&D 2 project on the Monongahela R iver, and 800 x 110 locks of the size found at the newer projects on the Kanawha River.<BR>The purpose of the current contract is to determine the probable size of the future fleet at the Emsworth, Dashields, and Montgomery projects in terms of both the number of barges per tow and the types of barges in the tow.  The type of barges is important because the upper Ohio and adjacent tributaries still have significant numbers of what are referred to as regular barges, which measure 175 in length and 56 in width and carry 900 tons at 9 of draft.  These barges were developed to maximize utilization of 360 x 56 locks, which predominated on the Monongahela, Kanawha, and Allegheny Rivers throughout most of the past 100 years.  With a few exceptions most of th ese small lock chambers have been replaced with larger locks or relegated to infrequent use as auxiliary locks.  As a result there is evidence that few is any regular sized barges are under construction or will be constructed in the future.  The phase out of regular barges would reduce the capacity of the auxiliary locks at EDM since only one jumbo barge, 195 x 35, can fit in the chambers compared to four regular barges.  The size of tows in terms of the number of barges per tow is important because it af fects the efficiency of waterway traffic since larger tows are more cost efficient than smaller tows.  The contractor will be responsible for determining the likely size of the tows given alternative lock sizes at EDM, including the existing lock sizes.  A s a part of this contract work, an eight-step process is envisioned.  The Contractor will 1. review the current fleet data for EDM and other projects;   2. develop a concept list of factors that affect the size of the fleet;   3. survey carriers concerning  the size of the fleet for alternative lock sizes at EDM;  4.  develop the future fleet size for alternative lock sizes at EDM;  5.  review current data regarding the size of barges under construction and planned;  6.  survey carriers on future constructio n of barges by size;  7.  develop the future fleet by barge size;  and 8. document the study and results.   3.  APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES:  52.212-1:  T he provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial, applies to this acquisition without addenda.  52.212-2:  The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation  Commercial Items is applicable to this acquisition and the following evaluation procedures app ly:   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the task order.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the DHS Office of Security.  Contract employees assigned to the task order not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.

Contract employees awaiting an EOD decision may begin work on the task order provided they do not access sensitive Government information.
