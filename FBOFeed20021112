Potential licensing opportunity with BBWI, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  BBWI is soliciting written indications of interest from industrial partners interested in entering into a non-exclusive license agreement for the purpose of commercializing this technology.  License terms may include an up-front licensing fee and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BBWI or the DOE.  This solicitation will close to response 30 days after publication.  Interested parties should send an expression of interest, a description of their company and any plans to commercialize this technology to the following address:  Gary W. Smith, Sr. Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BBWI, P. O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805.  E-mail is smitgw@inel.gov.  A description of the technology follows. 

ABSTRACT: The Integrated Waste Tracking System (IWTS) is a fully functional waste management and tracking database that is being used by DOE?s Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory ? West and the Navy Reactor Facility for more than six years.

SUMMARY: The Integrated Waste Tracking System (IWTS) is used to manage radioactive and hazardous waste throughout the entire lifecycle from waste declaration to disposal.  This includes tracking of waste during generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal. IWTS provides all information necessary for facilities to properly manage and demonstrate inventory compliance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations, DOE Order 435.1, State permits, and facility-specific Safety Analysis Report (SAR) requirements.  IWTS is currently implemented at both the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (including Argonne National Laboratory ? West and the Naval Reactors Facility) and the West Valley Demonstration Project located in West Valley, New York.  It is currently being deployed at DOE?s  Pantex Plant and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  IWTS technology includes bi-directional replication providing high reliability and a means for system expansion.  As a platform-independent, client-server and Web-based, inventory and compliance system, IWTS has been proven as a successful tracking and reporting tool to meet the needs of both operations and management.  

IWTS is built around three fundamentals: 1) waste characterization, 2) container characterization, and 3) waste movement and processing.  Three-tiered facility models (i.e., facility, unit, and grid x-y-z) are defined within the system to represent the appropriate hierarchy of site-specific structures. Waste characterization is captured and then associated to physical containers.  Containers may be scanned for identification and location purposes by handheld, wireless, scanning devices.  All container characterization data resides within IWTS.  Shipments, processes (i.e., repackaging, incineration, or compaction), and disposals are tasks that are modeled.  Each container profile provides a task history and graphical genealogy of the respective container.  Hazardous Waste Manifest reporting is also provided within the application.

To assist with meeting compliance issues, IWTS provides a mechanism for review and approval of profiles, temporary accumulation area (TAA) and low-level waste (LLW) tracking, and physical limit evaluations.  Handheld inventory tools (scanners) also provide real-time, remote inventory analysis and verification.  Quality record tracking requirements are currently in development for incorporation within IWTS.  

With data-driven functionality, client and web-based reporting, and remote access, IWTS provides a high level of flexibility in the management of waste for any facility.

<DESC>The Government desires to solicit comments to the draft Performance Work Statement provided under this synopsis.  All comments are to be submitted via e-mail, and are due by 4:00 PM on Wednesday 20 Nov 02. Telephone and facsimile responses to this synopsis will not be accepted.  In July 2000, the Department of the Navy announced the Retail Supply function as a candidate for a Commercial Activities study in accordance with OMB Circular A-76.  The intent of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing the following services in the Mid-Atlantic Region:  1) Warehouse Operations, 2) Material Delivery, 3) Customer Service, 4) Inventory Management, 5) Program Management, and 6) Unique Industrial Activity Support.  Limiting conditions for this acquisition include the need for the Service Provider to be fully capable of supporting the various operational and Systems Commanders requiring Retail Supply support.  These operational and Systems Commanders include, but are not limited to, Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Naval Ordnance Command (NAVORD), Commander, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (COMLANTFLT), Space and Warfare Command (SPAWAR), and various Naval Stations, Naval Air Stations, and Industrial Activities, such as Norfolk Naval Shipyard.  This effort will include support for various functions such as the nuclear operations conducted at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and the weapons assembly operations at RSO Peninsula's Yorktown site.  Accordingly, the Service Provider must be capable of gaining access to all facilities requiring support, to include the ability to obtain all necessary security clearances.  In addition, the Service Provider must have expertise in the multifaceted Supply-related Information Technology (IT) systems, including Uniform Automated Data Processing System (UADPS), UADPS U2, Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System (NALCOMIS), Material Access Technology (MAT), Integrated Logistics Support Management System (ILSMIS), Equipment Management and Control System (EMACS), World Ports System (WPS), Relational Supply (R-Supply). These site-specific systems are critical to the performance of the Retail Supply function due to their integration with the overall operations of the customers at the various sites.  Due to this operational interrelationship, use of alternative systems will not be allowed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source contract with the National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards, Inc. (NCSBCS) to implement the Action Agenda of the National Alliance for Building Regulatory Reform in the Digital Age.  NCSBCS was established in 1967 as a not for profit to provide building code and regulatory expertise to the nations governors.  Over the last four years, NCSBCS has led a project for NIST entitled "Streamlining the Building Regulatory System".  During the first phase (Phase I) of this project, NCSBCS held a national technology forum to enhance the use of information technology as a vital tool in the building regulatory process and produced a preliminary Action Agenda.  Based on their work completed in Phase I, the Government considers NCSBCS the only organization capable to continue task force meetings and to execute the pre-established action agenda.  NCSBCS will begin the second (Phase II) of three phases of its operations in the implementation of an action agenda that will stimulate economic recovery, enhance public safety and homeland security in buildings.  The agenda focuses on the use of information technology and the development and use by state and local jurisdictions of products, guidelines, model processes and procedures that enable jurisdictions to better respond to natural and manmade disasters and reduce the regulatory cost of construction by up to 60 percent.  NCSBCS will also provide support for the development and initial testing of a prototype secure database for first responders of as-built designs, evacuation plans, and other contract information.  

NCSBCS will complete the following tasks:  Task A, continue development of Technology Task Force work products including:  matrix of jurisdictions using hardware and software to regulate construction, model building regulatory architecture, and case studies of implementation of information technology. Task B, initial work to develop a prototype of the proposed secure first responder database.  Task C, development and distribution of model processes and legislation to streamline building regulatory process enhancing economic competitiveness and homeland security.  Task D, work jointly with the Technology and Planning & Coordinating Task Forces to develop a realistic vision of a transformed building regulatory system and conduct a national workshop to explore alternative approaches for assessing building performance.  Task E, support work of Alliance's Steering Committee to expand membership in National Alliance and develop next work deliverables for the project. 

The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) (no profit) contract on or about December 1, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by November 27, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) package is not available.  (See Notes 22 and 26)

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>In Annex I of the Request for Proposals (RFP) and in the FedBizOpps solicitation, the correct amount of the grant should be $207,000.  All other information contationed in the FBO announcement and the RFP remains the same.

Proposal Sumbission Location:  Huang Yibin, Executive Vice Director, Foreign Affairs and Economic Section, Jiangsu Environmental Protection Department, 14/F 7 Xikang Road, Nanjing 210024, P.R. China, Tel:(86-25) 663-9495, Fax:(86-25) 331-2450, Email:jiedc@public1.ptt.js.cn.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assisting Jiangsu Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in reviewing and evaluating the province?s existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework, as well as evaluating equipment and technologies for upgrading the system.

The environmental quality monitoring in Jiangsu Province is currently being done by on-site manual sampling and conventional lab analysis.  This process is done only once per month and is generally considered insufficient and inefficient.  The information that is generated, is not enough to meet the standards established by the State Council to monitor industrial discharge and environmental quality.  The environmental quality is further degraded by the relatively large population and scare land area of the Province.  

To help remedy these pollution problems, Jiangsu Province is in the process of enhancing its automatic environmental quality monitoring and control system.  It is planned that from 2000 -2005, 70 automatic air quality monitoring substations and 2 mobile air quality monitoring stations will be set up in the Province.  These stations will provide real-time data acquisition, distant monitoring, and real-time transmission.  During the same time frame (2000 - 2005), 50 automatic water quality monitoring stations and 3 mobile water quality monitoring stations will be established.  

In addition to the water and air monitoring stations, an environmental information processing system will be developed and implemented.  The system includes an environmental information control center and an environmental monitoring data transmission mechanism.  The control center takes the peer-peer communication means, collects data in a set time frame and implements distant monitoring.

The Jiangsu EPD seeks to hire a Contractor to develop a feasibility study to assist in reviewing and evaluating the province's existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework, as well as evaluating equipment and technologies for upgrading the system. The proposed feasibility study will include an evaluation of the existing air and water quality monitoring capabilities and framework; assistance in monitoring locations and determining parameters for air monitoring; assistance in evaluating monitoring locations and determining parameters for water monitoring; a recommendation of air quality monitoring equipment; a recommendation of water quality monitoring equipment; an evaluation of automatic monitoring data collection, processing, distant transmission, and real-time data acquisition systems; an economic and financial analysis of the project; an analysis of the probable environmental impact of the project; and an assessment of the equipment needed to carry out the project.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $270,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. local time, December 18, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SUBJECT>A--Commercial Off-The-Shelf Explosive Detection Equipment for Improvised Explosive Devices
<SOLNBR>002
<RESPDATE>112902
<CONTACT>Tom Terneus, 301-744-6850 x226
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Explosive Detection Equipment (EDE) capable of finding Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in cargo, and vehicles, that pose hazards to military operations.  This market survey solicits those vendors who are developing, or have developed, equipment manufactured for the purpose of screening wheeled vehicles of all sizes.  This solicitation is for information that fully explains the existing technology features/capabilities in areas of penetration, resolution, and discrimination.  In the future, DoD expects to select vehicle screening EDE systems for testing and evaluation as required by Anti-Terrorism/Physical Security/Force Protection organizations across the DoD using this information.  Results of testing and evaluation of vendor systems will be collected to provide DoD users a comprehensive explanation o f equipment/system capabilities in meeting DoD requirements.  DoD is specifically seeking technologies of IED, or IED components, detection that protect the force and prevent terrorist bombings against military personnel, equipment and military installations by finding the IEDs in the methods of conveyance at points of entry.  These technologies include, but are not limited to, bulk (x-ray, neutron, gamma ray, etc.) detectors.   Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection/physical security personnel to find IEDs, or IED components, effectively and reliably, while inspecting or pre-screening vehicles for authorized entrance at military installations without slowing throughput by more than 15%.  DoD requests that any party interested provide:  a) an Equipment Technical Summary of five or fewer pages and b) a written summary of two pages for each model  of their EDE.  Format of submissions is at the vendors discretion, however, it must include information included in the attached Technical Summary guidance.  Each submission shall be transmitted electronically and in hard copy format to the below point of contact not later than 29 November 2002.  This announcement is NOT a formal solicitation and is NOT a request for proposal.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced separately.   This synopsis is for the information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantage business (SDB), a small woman owned business (WO), or large business  (L).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THERE IS NO COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE U. S. NAVY TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS REQ UEST FOR INFORMATION.  POC:  Rose Baker, 301-744-6883, email: baker@eodpoe2.navsea.navy.mil.  .  FINAL Technical Summary Paper Format 1.  General Information. 1.1.  Vendor Information.  Name, address, point of contact, email and postal address, telephone number, and related WebPages, if applicable. 1.2.  Point of Contact.  Vendor representatives name and contact information. 1.3.  System Title.  EDE name and model. 1.4.  System Picture.  Photograph of EDE, preferably illustrating the unit in operation. 1.5.   Technology.  A brief description of the technology used by this product consisting of the technology title and five or fewer descriptive sentences.  1.6.   Output.  Samples of output produced directly by the EDE while in operation that identifies the IED characteristics present in the target of interest.  Examples of output include X-ray images or graphical  / tabular data of chemical composition from either air sample (trace detection) or neutron analysis. 1.7.  Life Cycle Cost.  Life Cycle Cost, measured in $US, of the EDE includes:  a) unit cost, b) annual maintenance performed by vendor representatives, c) consumable items for operations, and d) operation and maintenance training provided by the vendor. 2.  Key Performance Parameters for EDE.   The following Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) measure performance in inspecting/screening vehicles before passage through the point of entry onto military installations under a wide variety of operational and environmental conditions.  Baseline testing of these KPPs will be done under Standard Conditions for Measuring Key Performance Parameters (refer to paragraph 2.5).  For the purpose of this document, IED components may include the initiator, the fusing and firing circuit, and /or the explosive charge to include:  ANFO, C4, TNT/Dynamite, Black Powder, Smokeless Powder, and Semtex.  IED refers to the combination of all the components that make up an IED. 2.1.  The Performance Parameters listed below fundamentally describe the Threshold (T) and Objective (O) degrees of success that the EDE must achieve in order to accomplish their operational mission.  Each Performance Parameter shall have corresponding Measures of Performance that will allow objective testing and evaluation of the EDEs capability to meet the Users Requirements for that Performance Parameter. Table B.  CRD Performance Parameter summary Key Performance Parameter	Threshold and Objective Detection Effectiveness       (Refer 2.1.1)	True Positives and True Negatives (%) >= 90% (T); 98% (O) False Positives and False Negatives (%) <= 10% (T); 2% (O) Detection Speed                    (Refer 2.1.2)	Normal Throughput Operations <= 15% (T); <=2% (O)               (% of unit time increased per item of interest) Manpower Supportability   (Refer 2.1.3)	Inspector requirements >=  three (T); one and one-half (O)    (factor of personnel required) Reliability            (Refer 2.1.4)	Reliability >= 90% (T); 98% (O) Interoperability     (Refer 2.1.6)	Host Nation Agreements; Guidance; Compatible Formats (O) 		2.1.1.  Detection Effectiveness.  EDE shall successfully determine the presence of (True Positives), and confirm the absence of (True Negatives), IEDs for 90% (T); 99.9% (O) or more of the time in or on the object of interest, i.e. in various methods of conveyance and their payloads entering U.S. government controlled areas.  Further, the EDE shall not falsely indicate the presence of (False Positives), nor falsely confirm the absence (False Negatives), o f IEDs on the object of interest, i. e. in various methods of conveyance and their payloads entering DoD controlled areas for more than 10% (T); 2% (O) of the time.   2.1.1.1.  True Positives  Determine the likelihood of a correct reading of the explosive compound; 2.1.1.2.  True Negatives  Determine the likelihood of no reading of any explosive compound when not present; 2.1.1.3.  False Positives  Determine the likelihood that the EDE gives a reading on an inert IED or EDE gives a reading of explosive not contained within the IED; and  2.1.1.4.  False Negatives  Determine the likelihood that EDE fails to give a reading of the explosive. 2.1.2.  Detection Speed.  EDE shall determine the presence of, or confirm the absence of, an IED in the method of conveyance without degrading the hourly rate of normal throughput operations by more than 15% (T); 2% (O) due to detect ion operations to include:  sample collection, sensor processing and signal analysis.  Non-intrusive inspection operations include:  sample collection, sensor processing and signal analysis. 2.1.3.  Manpower Supportability.  EDE shall determine the presence of, or confirm the absence of, an IED in the method of conveyance without increasing current manpower requirements for inspection by more than a factor of three (T);  one and one-half (O) and/or adversely affect other organization personnel requirements.   EDE shall not require any special skill identifier in order to operate and perform operator maintenance of the EDE.   2.1.4.  Reliability.  EDE shall be operationally ready to complete the mission to determine the presence of, or confirm the absence of, an IED in the method of conveyance without an operational mission hardware or software failure, degradation or dema nd on the support system for 90% (T); 99% (O) of the time that the methods of conveyance require inspection.  The equipments Operational Readiness is the likelihood that the EDE will complete its mission without an operational mission failure. 2.1.5.  Discrimination.  EDE shall differentiate between explosive materials and all other objects within the inspection field. 2.1.5.1.  Confusants, by themselves, are non-explosive compounds with characteristics similar to explosives and commonly occur in conveyance modes or in the environment.  When used in conjunction with explosives, confusants may be called masking agents. 	2.1.5.2.  Obscurants are compounds with characteristics unlike explosive materials, but hinder the detection of common explosive.  Due to obscurants ability to disrupt the imaging transmission path because of a high density or close proximity of the obscur ant to the explosive, the detection of common explosives may be reduced. 2.1.6.  Interoperability.  EDE shall:  a) comply with negotiated Host Nation Agreements (O), b) be effective within the projected guidance (O), and c) be compatible in communicating situational awareness on the presence of an IED threat in a universal format and media amongst AT/FP forces (O).   2.1.6.1.  It may provide capabilities in other mission areas, such as chemical or biological, if possible.  The Interoperability of EDE may be measured by examining its ability to:  a) meet applicable provisions of cognizant Host Nation Agreements, b) enhance or support established CINCs guidance, and c) transmit, receive, and store data and information in compatible formats amongst all affected elements of the AT/FP forces.   3.  Other System Characteristics. 3.1.   Size.  Outside dimensions in feet and i nches when stored, in transit to the screening site, and during screening operations.  Include the overall weight of the system, in pounds.   3.1.1  Include the operational footprint required for continuous screening. 3.2.   Power Requirements.  Include any necessary external power required to operate the system. 3.3.  Operators.  Task requirements for continuous operations.  Include level of training necessary for operator to be qualified to execute tasks. 3.4.   Limitations / Hazards / Special Requirements.  State any special EDE limitations, hazards and/or special requirements beyond conditions stated herein to include hazards, such as radiation sources or toxic chemicals and their respective levels. 3.5.

<DESC>The pre-proposal package may be obtained from the Bureau of Reclamation home page located at URL http://www.usbr.gov/aamsden/AAMSsol.html.  Reference FY 2003 Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development (DWPR) Program Pre-Proposal for Task areas A, B, C, E, and F.  Parties without Internet access can request the pre-proposal package in writing by facsimile to (303) 445-6345 or to the email address contained herein rjackson@do.usbr.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Pre-proposals must be submitted in accordance with the instructions contained in the pre-proposal package and shall not exceed six pages in length.  Pre-proposals are due no later than 01/15/03.  The U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is currently requesting pre-proposals for research and studies activities sponsored by the DWPR Program.  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships with private industry, universities, local communities, and others to address a broad range of desalting and water purification needs.  The overall objective of the program is to reduce the cost of desalting and water purification technologies in order to augment water supply in the United States.  The Water Desalination Act of 1996, the authorizing legislation for this program, defines the following important terms (note the definitions are very broad and inclusive): (1) Desalination or desalting means the use of any process or technique for the removal and, when feasible, adaptation to beneficial use, of organic and inorganic elements and compounds from saline or biologically impaired waters, by itself or in conjunction with other processes. (2) Saline water means sea water, brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically impaired water.  For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation is soliciting pre-proposals in five (5) different research areas for projects of 12 months duration or less (follow-on funding may be available for additional research studies, pilot-plant projects, or future demonstration projects).  The research awards amounts vary according to the area of interest.  Offerors (other than academic institutions of higher education) must be willing to cost-share 50% or more of the project cost, depending on the financial need of the project.  Offerors proposing to provide additional cost-share will be given greater consideration.  Cost-sharing may be made through cash or in-kind contributions from the offeror, or third party non-Federal participants.  Cost-sharing is not mandatory from academic institutions, but is strongly encouraged.  The authorizing legislation for this program provides for up to a total of $1,000,000 per year to be awarded to academic institutions of higher education, including United States-Mexico binational research foundations and inter-university research programs established by the two countries, without any cost-sharing requirement.  No profit or fee will be allowed.  Patent rights for any developments will be retained by the research partner (offeror) in accordance with provisions contained in the solicitation.  Reclamations state-of-the-art water treatment laboratory and pilot-scale facilities are available for use on a cost reimburseable basis.  These include the Technical Service Center in Denver, Colorado, and the Water Quality Improvement Center, in Yuma, Arizona.  If you need detailed information on these facilities and costs, please contact the above.  Any responsible source, to include individuals, academic institutions, commercial or industrial organizations, private entities, public entities (including state and local), or Indian Tribal Governments, may submit a pre-proposal which will be considered by Reclamation.  Foreign entities, other than United States-Mexico binational research foundations and inter-university research programs established by the two countries, are not eligible for funding under the authorizing legislation for this program.  Federal agencies are not eligible to apply.  Pre-proposals will be reviewed for overall scientific and/or technical merit; potential contributions to Reclamations DWPR program objectives; qualifications of the proposer; and reasonableness of the estimated project costs.  Meritorious pre-proposers will be encouraged to submit a full proposal.  Submission of a pre-proposal is not mandatory; however, offerors are strongly encouraged to do so in order to receive the benefit of the initial pre-proposal screening process.  Solicitation packages for the full proposals will be issued on or about 02/13/03, with a due date of approximately 45 days after issuance.  Brief descriptions of each area of interest and their respective funding amounts are listed below.  During fiscal year 2003, and contingent upon Congressional funding, Reclamation anticipates making the research awards in the quantities listed below, subject to the content and quality of proposals received for each emphasis area; however, should additional funding become available, additional awards may be made.  A list of generic examples of the types of research and development opportunities that will be considered is provided below for each emphasis area.  These examples will not necessarily be given preferential consideration over unspecified research that also meets the goals of the program.  Research and studies priority areas for fiscal year 2003 are concentrate disposal issues, membrane processes, and non-traditional or alternative desalination processes.  TASK A - MEMBRANE PROCESS RESEARCH AND STUDIES - The primary objective of this task is to reduce the cost and increase the ease of operation of membrane-based desalting and water treatment systems.  Projects sponsored under this emphasis area can apply to any portion of a membrane treatment process including pretreatment related to membrane processes.  For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of four (4) to five (5) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the agreements.  Examples of these projects include but are not limited to (1) Development of integrated membrane systems (IMS), (2) Research on techniques for membrane storage or preservation and for biological control during plant operation, (3) Studies on adhesion of foulant or other materials to membrane surfaces, (4) Studies on membrane cleaning, including frequency and effectiveness, (5)  Development of improved membrane-containing element or stacks,  (6) Increase of rates of mass transfer to membrane surfaces, (7) Studies on influence of minor components in groundwater on membrane properties, (8) Studies on pretreatment specifically for membrane processes, (9) Studies on presence and influence of biofilms on membranes, and (10) Development of investigative techniques relating to membrane processes.  TASK B - THERMAL PROCESS RESEARCH AND STUDIES ? For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of one (1) to two (2) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the agreement.  Projects sponsored under this emphasis area are focus on improvements in thermally driven desalting processes.  Thermal processes are generally applied to seawater desalting due to the high energy investment.  Projects sponsored under this area can apply to any portion of the thermal desalting process, including pre- and post-treatment for these processes.  Examples of these projects include but are not limited to (1) Research and development studies of improvements and/or cost reductions in thermally driven desalting processes including multi-state flash, multiple effect, or vapor compression distillation, (2) Evaluation and development of methods to improve the heat economy of thermally driven desalting processes, (3) Investigation of methods to resolve pre- or post-treatment issues of thermally driven desalting processes, and (4) Investigation of methods to reduce the formation of scale and corrosion in thermally driven desalting processes.  Only technologies with the potential of becoming cost competitive with existing membrane and thermal processes will be considered.  Proposed projects should have the potential to become commercially viable and have wide applicability.  TASK C - NON-TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE DESALINATION RESEARCH AND STUDIES ? For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of two (2) to three (3) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the agreement.  Research and development studies will focus on investigation of non-traditional, or alternative desalination or water purification techniques, to include the evaluation of economics and thermodynamic efficiency of these processes.   Examples of these projects include but are not limited to (1) Development of new, innovative alternative desalination processes, (2) Investigation of innovative techniques combining desalination processes with renewable energy sources including photovoltaic, wind power, solar thermal, and geothermal, and (3) Investigation of freeze desalination and innovative combined desalination processes.  Only technologies with the potential of becoming cost competitive with existing membrane and thermal processes will be considered.  Proposed projects should have the potential to become commercially viable and have wide applicability.  TASK E - ANCILLARY AND ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS - For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of two (2) to three (3) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the agreement.  This emphasis area addresses four aspects of the authorizing legislation for this program that relate to the general economic improvement of desalination processes (1) A method for evaluating the economic implications of technological improvements is of primary importance at this time.  Reclamation has models for reverse osmosis and nanofiltration that are sensitive enough for this purpose, but needs models for electrodialysis, ion exchange, and thermal desalting methods.  If the costs of desalting are to be decreased through this program it is vital that models for all desalting methods be obtained so that the recent technological improvements made under this program can be compared on an equal basis, (2) Studies optimizing cost and/or design for different operating conditions, (3) Investigation of methods for increasing the economic efficiency of desalination processes, including hybrid systems or dual-purpose co-facilities with other processes involving the use of water, (4) Detailed surveys of construction and operating costs for desalination facilities with common itemized categories of costs for each plant surveyed normalized to a common basis.  TASK F - CONCENTRATE ISSUES - For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of a total of four (4) to five (5) financial assistance agreements of 12 months duration or less, with Federal funds of $75,000 to $100,000 awarded for each of the agreement.  Research and development studies will evaluate the various problems related to concentrate disposal, and develop innovative techniques to reduce concentrate disposal costs and impacts on the environment.  Examples of these projects include but are not limited to (1) Recovery and use of irrigation return flows, (2) Development of high salts complex mixtures, (3) Creating products that use salts, (4) Concentrate disposal systems development, (5) Recovery and use of concentrate by-products (dissolved salts), (6) Salinity modeling and toxicity analysis of concentrate discharges to the environment, (7) Substitution of brackish concentrate for potable water in industrial applications, and (8) Removal of supersaturated salts to permit further desalting of concentrate and reduce the volume of concentrate requiring disposal.  Only technologies with the potential of becoming cost competitive with existing alternative disposal methods will be considered.  Proposed projects should have the potential to become commercially viable and have wide applicability.

Several thousand are taken each year from ISS, which affords the potential for continuous observation or from Space Shuttle, which flies several times each year. A wide variety of camera formats are routinely available. Digital cameras provide the potential for immediate return of photography. Specific windows and observational enhancements on ISS and Space Shuttle provide the capability for research photographic quality.  A Window Observation Research Facility (WORF) will soon be available on ISS. In conjunction with the optical quality window the special facility surrounding the window provides attachment capabilities for sensors (cameras, multispectral scanners, and other instruments). There is a potential for automated or remote use of sensors, or operation by crew. Terms: Laws associated with distributing data developed with public funds are flexible. Photographic imagery produced by NASA or enhanced through privately owned or commercial processes may be sold by commercial entities. NASA is interested in considering terms and proposals associated with the planning, cataloging, use or distribution of earth observation imagery.

<CONTACT>William Mccullough, Contracting Officer, 505-845-6467, wmccullough@doeal.gov;William Mccullough, Contract Specialist, 505-845-6467, wmccullough@doeal.gov
<DESC>Description:  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Nationa= l Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) are committed to meaningfully increasing=  the involvement of the Nation?s small business community in supporting thei= r technical, scientific, and security endeavors.  As part of NNSA's suppo= rt of the Secretary of Energy's strong commitment to small business, the NNSA= Albuquerque Operations Office (AL) is planning the acquisition of suppo= rt to the Environmental Restoration (ER) Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and is contemplating setting aside this procurement for small business.  The purpose of this ?Sources Sought? announcement is to determine the availability of small businesses with the experience and expertise needed to provide the effort or a portion of the support to the ER Program. Interested Small Businesses are encouraged to review the Draft Statemen= t of Work (SOW) and provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to perform the= work required under any of the following business models.  Note: If  more th= an one firm will be involved, be sure to include the capabilities of the other= firms and identify which aspects of the Draft SOW will be performed by which firm. =B7 a single small business performs a majority of the Draft SOW on its=  own as a prime contractor; =B7 an affiliation/team of small businesses performs the entire or majo= rity portion of the Draft SOW as a prime contractor; or =B7 a single or affiliation/team of small businesses join with a large business entity(is) to perform the entire Draft SOW. Size Standard:  This procurement is classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, size standard 500 employees. Background:  From 1945 to the mid-1980s, the Laboratory disposed of radioactive and hazardous materials in a manner that affected its 43-square-mile ar= ea and surrounding lands.  These potentially contaminated areas have been designated as potential release sites (PRSs).  DOE/NNSA is charged with the environmental restoration of these sites including both characterization and remediat= ion. The Rough Order of Magnitude for the ER Program at LANL is on the order=  of $500 million over eight years.  These PRSs have varying contaminant inventor= ies, including inorganic liquids, sludge, solids, liquid and volatile organi= c chemicals, non-nuclear explosives residues, and radioactive compounds. These wastes were disposed of in accordance with the practices of the time; however, more protective regulations have since been enacted to ensure that thes= e PRSs do not pose unacceptable risks to human or ecological receptors, either=  now or in the future. ER Project PRSs consist of solid waste management units (SWMUs) and are= as of concern (AOCs).  SWMUs are regulated by the state of New Mexico under RCRA/Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA); the New Mexic= o Hazardous Waste Act; and Title 20, Chapter 4, Part 1, ?Hazardous Waste Management,? of the New Mexico Administrative Code (NMAC).  AOCs are regulated primarily by the DOE. General Requirements:  Environmental Restoration activities at LANL ful= fill the characterization and remediation requirements of various hazardous wast= e sites within the Laboratory and its environs. The key elements of this projec= t may include any or all aspects of the Resources Conservation and Recovery A= ct (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and Comprehensive Environme= ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).  Specific work at P= RSs at LANL include remedial investigations, feasibility studies, remedial des= ign and remedial action as applicable to various hazardous waste sites primaril= y within the Los Alamos County boundaries; groundwater monitoring and assessment= s; final design and preparation of construction plans; specifications and cost estimates; preparation of complete or partial environmental impact statements (EISs); environmental assessments (EA); environmental inventories (EI) = and related special-studies documentation; hazardous waste inventories and recovery plans; risk-based assessments; air-emission inventories; permit applications; multimedia environmental compliance audits/assessments; storm water pollution prevention planning; baseline environmental/human health risks assessme= nts; and other scientific and technological investigations to accomplish the mis= sion and complete environmental restoration assignments. Contract deliverables include site characterization and compliance; feasibility investigations; RFIs; CMSs; preparation of decision documents; remedial= designs; IAs; corrective actions; short-term operation and maintenance;= pollution prevention; and services projects within Los Alamos County, N= ew Mexico.  Additional broad environmental field activities that include sediment investigations; alluvial groundwater and surface water investigations; contaminant transport; groundwater and surface water hydrology; prepara= tion of work plans and sampling and analysis plans (SAPs); soil-gas sampling; geophysical surveys; and all aspects of field sampling for solid and hazardous wastes may be required.  Experience is required in risk-based correctiv= e actions, human health risk and ecological risk assessments and screenin= gs. Field experience is required to include the excavation and removal of contaminated soils and materials and the construction of engineered cap= s for landfills, the installation, development, sampling and long-term surveillance of monitoring wells; and preparation and execution of pumping tests.  T= otal depths for monitor wells in the ER programs commonly exceed 1300 ft bel= ow ground surface (bgs).  Any work requiring professional engineering certification must be done by or under the direct supervision of regist= ered professional engineers, licensed in the State of New Mexico. Firms must demonstrate capability and experience in, providing laborato= ry services for physical analyses; performing geophysical logging; accomplishing pump tests and borehole or well slug tests; performing water sampling; preparing site-specific safety and health plans (SSHASPs); characterizi= ng sites, including models and predictions of contaminant migration in vad= ose and saturated zones. This sources sought announcement is being used solely to determine if sufficient small business capability exists to set aside this acquisiti= on for small business.  Large businesses should not reply to this announcement= , but should strongly consider teaming with a small business (or a consortium/team/affiliation of small businesses).  Small businesses are= requested to submit to NNSA/AL a Statement of Capability (SOC), that includes the following information: =B7 Name of Firm(s) (including address); =B7 Point of Contact (Name, Telephone Number and E-Mail Address); =B7 Small Business Status of the firm or firms; =B7 Related experience of firm(s), within the last three years, relativ= e to the general requirements.

<SUBJECT>Q -- CMS Nursing Home Chain Project
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will select one Medicare Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) contractor to partner with several large (multi-State, multi-facility) nursing home organizations ("chains") to assist the chains in implementing quality improvement collaboratives for their member facilities.  This notice is posted to invite expressions of interest from qualifying chains to participate in this pilot project.  

This project will take place over a period of 18 months.  During this time, we anticipate each participating chain will organize approximately 4 "learning sessions" involving up to 50 project teams each.  Project teams represent the chain's individual facilities and will be expected to conduct improvement activities between learning sessions, with facilitated interaction between teams via teleconference, email, etc.  The QIO coordinating this project will serve as the principal link between the chain and the QIO program with respect to CMS's Nursing Home Quality Initiative.  The coordinating QIO will also provide each participating chain with materials and instruction necessary to implement collaborative quality improvement activities targeted at improving performance on one targeted quality measure within the chain's member facilities.  Any individual facility within the chain may also work with its State QIO on this, or other topics related to the nursing home quality measures CMS will publicly report in late 2002.  Chains will be responsible for costs of implementing quality improvement activities within their organizations and facilities.  Chains will also be responsible for any costs (such as travel, lodging, long-distance telephone charges) associated with their participating in learning opportunities and activities provided by the QIO in the course of this project. 

Based on research and discussions with nursing home industry representatives, QIOs, and other relevant stakeholders, the Quality Measure targeted for improvement under this limited-duration pilot project will be:  The Percentage of Residents with Pain. 

Due to limited funding available for the pilot project, participation in the study will be limited.  CMS will review the written expressions of interest we receive from organizations volunteering to participate in this project, and, based on the information each chain provides in its expression of interest, will select up to six chain organizations to participate in this pilot project.  After consultation with relevant stakeholders, we have developed minimum criteria to qualify for participation:
 
Minimum Criteria for Participation
1.	Chain organization must operate nursing facilities (certified by Medicare, Medicaid, or both) in at least 10 separate States (and/or U.S. Territories).
2.	Chain organization must at the time of volunteering to participate operate a minimum of 50 total nursing facilities (certified by Medicare, Medicaid, or both).
3.	Organization must provide evidence of an existing quality infrastructure and a statement of willingness to utilize resources within this infrastructure to work with this project?s coordinating QIO. 

In the event more than six chains express interest in participating and document that they meet or exceed minimum selection criteria, CMS will prioritize volunteers for final selection as participants based on both the chains specific characteristics in relation to minimum criteria and consideration of the additional characteristics described below.  

Additional Characteristics Considered in Selecting Participating Organizations
1.	Number of Medicare beneficiaries whose care would be potentially improved. 
2.	Wide geographic distribution of chain's member facilities preferred.
3.	Demonstrated motivation, resources, and ability to partner with QIOs to optimize Quality Improvement systems within nursing homes and chains.

Via this notice, CMS invites expressions of interest from qualifying chains.  A letter expressing interest is not a binding commitment to participate.  In response to stakeholder requests that we minimize unnecessary delays in implementing this project, the process for selecting the coordinating QIO and participating changes are proceeding simultaneously.  This will result in CMS selecting the coordinating QIO after we have chosen the participating chain organizations.  Those chains selected to participate will be informed of the QIO selected to coordinate this project when this information is known, and will also have an opportunity to review detailed materials about how this project will be conducted and its impact analyzed before being asked to fully commit to this project.

Letters of interest may be transmitted via paper mail, fax, or electronic mail, and should include the name, address, business phone, and email address for a point of contact for this project within the chain.  Letters of interest should not exceed three pages in length. 

Because CMS will select participants based on chain characteristics as documented in their expressions of interest, any chain organization responding to this notice should clearly and explicitly address the points listed below.

Points to Address in Letter of Interest: 
1.	How chain meets the minimum criteria for participation.
2.	Chain's characteristics in relation to additional characteristics considered in selecting chains.
3.	How the chain proposes to implement quality improvement under this project.
4.	How this project would fit into chain's existing quality infrastructure.

Any nursing home chain organization interested in participating should submit its non-binding letter of interest to CMS at the address below.  In order to be considered, letters of interest must reach CMS by 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) on 22 November 2002.  

Letters of interest, and any questions about this notice, should be directed to:
