<DESC>Pilot Project for a National Monitoring System 
for Major Adverse Effects of Medication Use 
during Pregnancy and Lactation

BACKGROUND

The use of a number of medications during pregnancy is known to be associated with serious adverse effects in children. Thalidomide and isotretinoin (Accutane) are the most notable examples, but there are others. Recent controversies surrounding the use of medications specifically to increase breast milk production have brought renewed attention to safety concerns about medication use during lactation. However, because pregnant and lactating women are traditionally excluded from clinical trials, and because premarketing animal studies do not necessarily predict the experience of humans, little information is available about the safety of most prescription medications during pregnancy and lactation at the time they are marketed. In addition, reproductive animal studies may not be conducted routinely for non-prescription drugs. While it is considered prudent to avoid taking medications when pregnant or breastfeeding, this is not always possible. Half of pregnancies in the United States each year are unplanned, so that many women inadvertently use medications early in gestation during the critical period of fetal development before realizing they are pregnant. In addition, many maternal conditions (e.g., asthma, epilepsy, depression) require treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the cessation of which could pose a risk to the of both mother and infant. 

Currently, the United States has no early warning system for major adverse pregnancy or infant outcomes related to medication exposures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration collects reports of adverse health events associated with medication use, but the extended length of time between many pregnancy exposures and outcomes makes underreporting a major limitation of this system for monitoring pregnancy outcomes. Adverse event reports are not routinely analyzed to assess pregnancy and lactation risk. Further, healthcare providers may be unaware that a woman is breastfeeding, and thus even less likely to report an adverse event related to lactation. Additionally, pediatric healthcare providers may not recognize breastfeeding as a potential source of medication exposure in a child. Because use of individual medications among child-bearing aged women can be low, it can take years for case control studies and birth defects surveillance systems to identify adverse effects of medications after they are marketed.

Teratology Information Services (TIS) throughout the United States and Canada utilize trained specialists to provide free phone consultation, risk assessment, and counseling about environmental exposures during pregnancy and breastfeedingincluding prescription and over-the-counter medicationsto women and healthcare providers. TIS specialists research information about the effects of exposures during pregnancy and lactation from multiple sources (e.g., drug companies, the medical literature, other specialists). Altogether, they respond to approximately 70,000-100,000 inquiries each year. Because they have direct contact with pregnant and breastfeeding women, TIS are in a unique position to monitor the effects of medication exposures during pregnancy and lactation. A few TIS have conducted follow-up studies of pregnant women who contacted them after taking a specific medication. However, this type of monitoring of pregnancy and breastfeeding outcomes has never been conducted on a large scale. 

PURPOSE

To collect data for use in assessing whether TIS in the United States can serve as an effective monitoring and early warning system for major adverse effects of medication use during pregnancy and lactation. 

SCOPE OF WORK

Within a continuous six-month period (up to a maximum of 250 enrollees), the vendor will recruit all women who contact their service and who have used any prescription or over-the-counter medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding to participate in a follow-up study. The vendor will explain the project and obtain informed consent from each participant to conduct telephone interviews. For each pregnant woman who agrees to participate, the vendor will conduct a telephone interview at enrollment, during the third trimester of pregnancy, after delivery, and when the infant is about 3 months old. For each breastfeeding woman who agrees to participate, the vendor will conduct a telephone interview at enrollment, at one month after enrollment, and, if the woman is taking a chronic medication and still breastfeeding, at 3 months after enrollment. The interviews will assess maternal and fetal health throughout pregnancy, and maternal and infant health at delivery, during the newborn and early infancy period, and while breastfeeding. The specific schedule for interviews is provided in Appendix A. The specific minimum data to be collected in each of the interviews is provided in Appendix B. This same information should be collected from all participants regardless of whether they enroll while pregnant or after delivery while breastfeeding The vendor should conduct each interview in a way that allows the information obtained to be combined with that from other TIS conducting similar follow-up activities under similar requisitions.

NOTE:  CDC IRB and OMB clearance has been submitted
