<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the optimization of the design of ultrasonic phased array probes and eddy current array probes for inspection of the Shuttle Flow Liners.  Deliverables will include: OMNI-PA 16:128 Omni Scan Phased Array unit; OMNI-M-ECA Eddy Current Array Acquisition module including the ECA acquisition software;Tomoview 2.2 software for Omniscan; Phased Array Simulation Software, PASS;Phased Array Probe, Angle beam type, 5 MHz, 16 elements, P/N 5L16-A1;Standard wedge, angle beam probe A1, lateral scan, 45 deg shear wave, P/N SA1-L45S; Standard wedge, angle beam probe A1, normal scan, 45 deg shear wave, P/N SA1-N45S; Phased Array Probe, immersion type, 10 MHz, 64 elements, P/N 10L64-I1; Phased Array probe, angle beam type, 10 MHz, 32 elements, P/N 10L32-A1; High frequency surface eddy current array probe with 1/16 inch coil size, 32 channels P/N SBB-025-01M-032; Mini-encoder kit with brackets for phased array probe, P/N OMNI-A-ENC1; Brackets for Mini-Encoder to Eddy Current array probe, P/N OMNI-A-ENC2BRACK; OnmiScan Accessory Kit, P/N OMNI-A-ACC1; and, Training – 3 days training on the use of the OmniScan Instrument and the specific methods for low liner at Kennedy Space Center. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from R/D Tech as the only known source who can meet the governments requirements.  NASA is currently developing advanced ultrasonic array and eddy current nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods for the flow liner in the liquid oxygen feed line into the Shuttle main engines.	Method development is being conducted using a government owned R/D Tech OmniScan portable phased array instrument and off the shelf array probes and angle wedges.  For implementation of the flow liner, the design of the array probes and coupling angle wedges must be optimized to meet the geometric and practical limitations presented by the flow liner inspection on the Orbiter.  The delays required to develop matching and hardware interfaces would result in unacceptable delays to NASA.    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13.5. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 4, 2004. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.
