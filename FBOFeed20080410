<DESC><p>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice / procurement synopsis for the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Targeting System (HTS) Production Lot 8 buy, scheduled for award in FY09. The 308th Armament Systems Wing (308 ARSW) intends to award one (1) sole source contract for the 8th production run of HTS pods to Raytheon Company, Missile Systems Division, 1151 E. Hermans Rd, Tucson, AZ 85706-9367. The authorities for going sole source are FAR 6.302-1 [10 U.S.C.(c)(1)], Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements and FAR 6.302-6 [10 U.S.C.(c)(6)], National Security.
<p>Specific production requirements may include, but are not limited to, HTS pods, associated spares and support / support items [i.e. program management, engineering, logistics, test support, support equipment, spares, offset administration, and associated data]. Total production for Lot 8 is estimated to be from a minimum of 9 pods up to a maximum of 38 pods. Deliveries for Lot 8 are anticipated to begin Nov 2010. The estimated contract value is $10.2M and the anticipated contract award date is 30 Nov 08.</p>
<p>Raytheon Company, the current HTS pod producer, is presently in production; therefore, the Government will not be able to provide government property, government special tooling, and/or special test equipment to any prospective new source. Consequently, the fulfillment of the above supplies requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.</p>
<p>Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Jon Olson (Raytheon Company) at the above address or phone (520) 794-2524. The response date to this synopsis is 26 May 2008. Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms. Holly Deuser, Contracting Officer, at (850) 883-0296, 693 ARSS/PK, 207 West D Ave, Bldg 349, Rm 4300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for 500 each Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filterbodies with Swagelok tube fittings and 1000 each 440 Micron Mesh, which are the elementsthat go inside of the filter bodies.  The delivery is required by June 30, 2008.   NASA/ARC intends to purchase these items from Swagelok Sunnyvale, located at 929 WeddelCt., Sunnyvale, California, 94089, because they are the sole-proprietary manufacturer ofthe requested filters.	These are Stainless Steel In-Line Particulate Filters, 440 micronmesh, with Swagelok tube fittings, which will be used in the Arc Jet Complex.  Therequested filters are the only filters that come stock with Swagelok fittings, thusrequiring no additional fitting conversions.  This particular brand name, Swagelok, is essential to the Governments requirements sincethe Arc Jets currently have connections that only match up with Swagelok fittings and isa proprietary ferrule-compression fitting that cannot be interchanged with other types offerrule-compression fittings.The Stainless Steel In-Line particulate filters need to have Swagelok fittings thatconsist of a nut, furrule, and gland that is not interchangeable with other manufacturesof swaged fittings and need to meet the following requirements:	 Inline design required due to space limitations 	 Connect to 3/8 hose	 Working pressure of system - 1200 [psi]	 Swagelok fittings required to mate-up to existing hoses	 Fast field change of filter element required (i.e.   	 hose to remain in place)	 Variable filter (strainer or sintered) size, currently 	 requesting 440 [m]The filters will be used on the de-ionized cooling water system of the InteractionHeating Facility (IHF).   With the installation of a new high pressure pumping system forthe IHF and water passages decreased in size to increase velocity/cooling in the archeater column, particulate contamination of the cooling system has become an issue. Thesefilters will strain the de-ionized water system of particulates thus preventing thecooling water passages in the arc heater column from getting blocked. This will preventarc heater failure due to segment overheating.	Currently the cooling water passages varyin size from .055 [inches] to .070 [inches].  There are approximately 450 de-ionizedcooling water supply lines feeding the heater, each of which requires an in-line filter.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort via email to the identified point of contact no later than 4:00 p.m. PST on April21, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose ofdetermining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

(APR 2004)
(a)	This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103.  An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103.  The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum.  After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed.  A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA.
(b)	An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following:
(1)	A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.
(2)	The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.
(3)	An award or proposed award of the contract.
(4)	A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.(c)	Voluntary Automatic Stay.  This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).(1)	In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest.  This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay).  However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden.  This is known as an automatic stay override.<BR><BR>(2)	The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing.  A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.  Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.
(3)	The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program.  Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice.  The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action.  In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start.  This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO.  Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.

(d)	An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. 
(e)	For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.  The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority.  
(f)	An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief.  All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest.
(g)	Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from (Eric Vokt US ARMY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY DIRECTORATE OF CONTRACTING SFCA-NR-DW MS#1 5330 VALDEZ CIRCLE DUGWAY, UTAH 84022-5001).<BR><BR>ACRONYM (MEANING): FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation), DFARS (DoD FAR supplement), CLIN (Contract Line Item Number), SUB-CLIN or SLIN (Contract Subline Item Number), OSHA (Occupational Safety Health Act), FOB (Free-on-Board), PCO (Procuring Contracting Officer), CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), LSA (Labor Surplus Area), SF (Standard Form), DD/DOD (Department of Defense), NSP (Not Separately)Priced<BR><BR>This is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Smiths Detection-Edgewood Inc, 2202 Lakeside Boulevard, Edgewood, MD, 21040-1102.

<a href="mailto:mindy.franklin@us.army.mil">ACA, White Sands Missile Range</a>
<DESC>The Army Contracting Agency, White Sands Missile Range Directorate of Contracting intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SciTech, Inc., 100 Wall Street, Princeton, NJ 08540-1523 to provide on-going support for the Joint Mobile Infrared Countermeasures Test System (JMITS)developed under Army contract W9124Q-04-C-0225. SciTec was the original developer of the JMITS systems. As a result of this development, SciTec possesses a unique knowledge of the design and operation of the JMITS system that no known source possess. Major components within the JMITS system that are of unique SciTec design are the UV and infrared (IR) emitters, the jam beam laser radiometers, the down range UV and IR radiometers and the data acquisition units. Additionally, the real-time operating software that controls the JMITS system is of SciTec design. The software represents on the order of 1M lines of code including embedded machine code; code developed using higher level languages and programming environments such as C++, MatLab and TENA. Communication between the different hardware components and control computers is accomplished over a proprietary high speed serial communications link, standard ETHERNET and WiFi links. Many of the non-real time code elements within the JMITS library contain unique algorithms and techniques needed to process and format the data that is shared among the JMITS components in the process of generating a missile warning system (MWS) signature and analyzing the data produced in a test run. Re-engineering this code could result in unreliable JMITS performance, and could invalidate the system as an operational test (OT) test resource.<BR><BR>Any work performed on the JMITS systems to include maintenance, repairs, upgrades, and producing duplicate systems/components must maintain commonality, interoperability, configuration control, validation, and uniform methodologies, procedures and processes within the overall JMITS architecture. <BR><BR>The following represent SciTec unique capabilities that were a direct result from the JMITS development: <BR>" Unique optical and electro-mechanical designs in UV and IR emitters<BR>" Proprietary emitter and radiometer operating/control firmware <BR>" Proprietary and specialized real-time operating and control software<BR><BR>The following represent specialized knowledge critical to JMITS operations available from SciTec:<BR>" UV and IR missile simulation development<BR>" UV and IR radiometry related to missile signatures <BR>" Jam laser radiometry and signal processing<BR>" Extensive MWS testing, missile signature collection and associated data processing and analysis<BR>" Missile flight and signature models; atmospheric and range corrections to missile signatures<BR><BR>The JMITS now represents a unique resource that is critical to ongoing service and non-DoD aircraft survivability enhancement programs. The JMITS system is specifically called out as a critical test resource in the Test and Master Plan (TEMP) for several programs and is slated for testing with many DoD programs. Many of these programs have time sensitive, schedule-driven events that require a very high reliability and availability rate from JMITS. Accordingly, the Government must have the capability for quick turn-around for maintenance and support. The Government must also perform continuing upgrades and improvements to the JMITS system in order to respond to evolving system under test (SUT) capacities and test requirements.<BR><BR><BR>A cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) award is anticipated. The Government intends to issue only this single notice under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis.Capability statements may be e-mailed to mindy.franklin@us.army.mil. Any interested sources will be referred to the program, and their capabilities will be evaluated, documented and considered. This notice is not a request for proposals.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A CONTRACT. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies, Cincinnati, Ohio, hereby announces its intent to issue a contract to W. A. Wilde, Inc. for mailing services.
<p>Background and Need<br />The statement of work is associated with a current contract with Brigham and Women's Hospital. Over 2.5 million nurses are employed in the U.S., 95% of whom are female. Female nurses are exposed to a wide variety of known and potential reproductive hazards including chemical and biological agents, physical demands, and shift work. NIOSH has the opportunity to build on collaboration with the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) team by participating in the NHS-III, a new study that will examine health outcomes among nurses in relation to occupational exposures, in addition to lifestyle and dietary factors. Potential participants will be mailed a letter from the study principal investigator, inviting them to participate in the web-based questionnaire. Data will be collected, stored, and analyzed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with oversight from NIOSH investigators. Letters of invitation for the pilot study have already been mailed to 12,000 women by W.A. Wilde, Inc., and we intend to mail to one million more nurses for the full study. NIOSH is funding approximately 40% of the mailings (420,000 nurses).</p>
<p>W.A. Wilde, Inc Mailing House has been working with the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) on the Nurses' Health Studies for over 20 years. They have a proven track record for a very high level of quality, which BWH demands in their print jobs. W.A. Wilde, Inc has specialized equipment to personalize and prepare the mailing jobs. Other mailers that BWH had used previously treated the mailings like they would with "junk" mail. In conducting a human health study of high quality, such as the Nurses' Health Studies, each mail piece is considered a human subject that needs to be contacted. In such, each letter and postcard must be treated by the receiver as if it were a monthly bill or invoice to be opened, and not junk mail to be thrown away. Losing even one is not acceptable. W.A. Wilde, Inc. has been able to fulfill these requirements. BWH has decided again to work with W.A. Wilde, Inc. as they have done in the past for their other studies. Their contact with W. A. Wilde, Inc. has already begun with a pilot phase of the NHS III, which has included 12,000 nurses.</p>
<p>This project is supported by justification for other than full and open competition to W.A. Wilde, Inc. under authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1). Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, Reference number 2008-Q-10413, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days negotiations will be conducted with W.A. Wilde, Inc., 200 Summer Street, Holliston, MA 01746 as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Based on availability of funds, the government may exercise options for additional mailings.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being processed under FAR 12, Commercial Procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<SOLNBR>6589
<RESPDATE>041008
<ARCHDATE>04252008
<CONTACT>Tanyka Lawrence, (202) 267-7802

<a href="mailto:tanyka.l.lawrence@faa.gov">tanyka.l.lawrence@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This market survey advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.1
The FAA invests a significant amount of resources in training its workforce.  To make a good investment, the agency maintains training objectives that are specific, measureable and task relevant.
One environment that developmental Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCS) are trained to perform in, nonradar, has become an unlikely part of their future job.  For this reason, its relevance has become questioned.  Eliminating nonradar training might save FAA resources or allow them to be allocated to other types of training.
However, there is anecdotal evidence from the FAA Academy that developmentals who perform poorly on nonradar training also perform poorly in radar associate (RA) training.  There is also anecdotal evidence from the field that developmentals not receiving nonradar training or only a portion of the training, performed poorly during radar training.  These observations suggest that nonradar training may make unique contributions to achieving relevant training objectives.
Nonradar training is provided as a part of the Initial En Route Training Course.  During the course, the FAA provides job-related knowledge and skill oriented training to developmental ATCS.  The course consists of four blocks of training:  Academics, Nonradar Academics/Lab, Radar Academics/Medium Fidelity Lab and RA Lab. The objective of the training is to enable the developmental to progress into field-delivered stages of air traffic control training.  Over one-third of the time spent in the course, 18 of 53 days, is devoted to the nonradar academics/lab block.  During this block, developmentals receive training on separation, coordination, control judgment, methods and procedures, and communication skills in a nonradar environment.
The FAA is seeking to learn of industry capabilities that will deliver conclusive scientific evidence about the utility of nonradar training so that the agency can make the best investment decisions.  The agency expects to require the contractor to deliver several pieces of information as a part of the evaluation.  
First, the contractor must identify what radar training needs the nonradar training may meet or enhance.  Second, the contractor must identify the element of nonradar training that meets the needs or enhance training effectiveness.  Finally, the contractor must compare the training effectiveness of the current nonradar training to a system without this type  of training and to a viable, efficient and effective alternative.
Interested vendors are requested to submit the following information.
*  Demonstrated application of knowledge of learning and training methodology to the evaluation of training programs and to instructional systems development (ISD).  Training evaluation experience should be emphasized with indication of the following:
*  Assessing knowledge, measuring behavior/skill and assessing job performance*  Identifying and addressing evaluation design, issues*  Knowledge of training evaluation alternatives*  Evaluation at multiple levels, from training effectiveness to job performance*  Experience with the operational Air Traffic Technical Training System*  Proposed approach to the nonradar training evaluation*  Estimated duration of the project*  Comments on requirements
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with response to this market survey announcement. 
Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.Responses may be submitted via email to tanyka.l.lawrence@faa.gov.  If sent electronically, it is preferred that the repsonse be sent as an attachment to the email message in Microsoft Word, PDF or similar format, on company letterhead and print to no more than 10 pages on 8 1/2 x 11 paper size and using 12 point font.
Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  One, some, all or none of the respondents to the market survey may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the government.
No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  Information obtained will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a nonradar training evaluation.
To those who responded to the Utility of Nonradar Training in the En Route Environment Market Survey out of the W.J. Hughes Tech Center (ACT) July 25, 2007 to Anne Marie Ternay, please resubmit.
Interested parties should reply via email by close of business April 28, 2008 to tanyka.l.lawrence@faa.gov

<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1042142

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Small Business sources that can rent 20-25 canine Collies for a 6-8 month period of performance.  FDAs clinical study is entitled Pharmacogenomics of the MDR-1 Gene Mutation and the Effect on P-Glycoprotein Substrates in Dogs and Other Veterinary Species.  The goal of the FDA is to determine whether the comparative pharmacokinetics of several known P-gp substrates are substantially different when administered to dogs that are homozygous recessive, heterozygous or the wild-types.  The MDR-1 gene encodes for P-gp, a transmembrane efflux protein that affects the absorption, distribution and elimination of certain drugs.  P-gp is a member of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transport protein family, which are efflux pumps that remove select agents from within the cell.  P-gp is part of a family of efflux transporters found along the intestinal tract, in the kidneys, biliary system, brain and other organs.  A mutation in the MDR-1 gene is known to occur in several dog breeds.  Since P-gp is an important efflux transporter for a wide range of compounds, dogs homozygous recessive for the MDR-1 mutation may have altered pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles for P-gp substrates including avermectins.  Most importantly, life threatening toxicity has been reported when certain P-gp substrates are administered to dogs that are known to be homozygous for the MDR-1 mutation.  In addition, there are anecdotal reports of heterozygote animals also expressing toxicity to some P-gp substrates and a small set of homozygous recessive genotype animals do not express the expected sensitive phenotype.  The animal phase will determine the pharmacokinetics of a small set of known P-gp substrates in known wild-type dogs versus dogs that are either heterozygous or homozygous recessive for the MDR-1 mutation.   For the contract to be awarded, the vendor is required to deliver the following: 
1.  A colony of 20-25 homozygous recessive, heterozygous ivermectin-sensitive (MDR-1 mutants) collies.
2.  FDA must be able to genotype the potential dogs (at our expense) prior to delivery to determine the suitability of the collies for the study.
3.  FDA must be able to have the collies on site for 6-8 months. 
4.  FDA must be able to obtain tissue biopsies from the liver and kidneys of the collies.
5.  May need to select collies from different venders to achieve the desired number of MDR-1 mutants. 
This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 5:00 pm (1600) EST on April 16, 2008.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov to be considered.  FDA intends to make an award soon after the response date of this notice and all bids must be submitted via email and be received by 10:00 AM (1000) EST on 25 April 2008 to the attention of David Kordel, david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov.  Evaluation/Award will be based on the technically acceptable quote that offers the best value to the Government. The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC><p>Requisition Number: FDA1041896
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Small Business sources that can process RNA samples in a 96-well format. The FDA anticipates a 2-year period of performance. The RNA samples shall be compatible with most high-throughput cellular screening projects allowing for the move seamlessly from compound library to high-content RNA expression data. The vendor shall also utilize automated processing which starts with purified nucleic acids and yields highly reproducible data. The vendor's automated high-throughput processing should be able to minimize technical variability to give the confidence that the results are biological effects and not technical artifacts. The vender shall have processes that include at least seven quality control check points where technicians measure more than fourteen parameters for each sample in an experiment. This detail is essential and gives the confidence and the power to compare newly generated data with your historical data sets. FDA also requires that a basic bioinformatics report is included with each experiment. This typically includes an annotated list of differentially expressed genes plus a quality control report containing starting sample quality measurements and a post-hybridization analysis of global chip parameters. The vender shall utilize 3' Whole-Genome Expression Profiling and Affymetrix's 3' Expression Arrays which has set the gold standard for whole-genome Expression Profiling. After a group of Alpha Metric Chips are analyzed, the vendor shall provide FDA scientists with an analytical report and/or conference calls to discuss the information contained in the report. The FDA will have one week to review the report. If further clarifications from the report are necessary, the vendor may be required to provide on-site explanation for its findings contained in the report to the FDA. There will be a total of 50-75 chips to analyze during the two-year period. This is a REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov) before 5:00 pm (1600) EST on April 15, 2008.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center intends to award a sole-source purchase order toVersatile Systems, Inc. The governing statutory provision is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "OnlyOne Responsible Source," in support of the Office of Systems Safety and Mission Assurance(OSSMA), Resource Analysis Office (RAO). This procurement is to extend the current purchase order period by 4 months, from May 1,2008 through August 31, 2008 in order to ensure RAO's critical mission support continuityand to avoid significant technical and programmatic impacts to GSFC, until a DataProgramming and Analysis of Aerospace Acquisition Data competitive contract is awarded. RAO's mission is to provide capability to GSFC Center management for independent cost andschedule estimating, risk assessment, and mission risk	success utilizing existing andprojected programs, their cost, technical, programmatic and acquisition implementationapproach. Their responsibility includes the development and maintenance of current costmodels supported by resource and technical databases, complied from current andhistorical data derived and collected from NASA's "corporate memory," as well as fromon-going market surveys and current cost projections, quotes, bids, and estimates. Thiscapability is critical to the efficient operation of the Center, in that it involves thedevelopment of accurate resource estimation and forecasting models for the planning andacquisition of future spacecraft programs and ancillary scientific instruments,scientific payloads and suites, mission systems integration and test, and other keyresource elements (i.e. cost, schedule, workforce, and risk assessment). Given thecritical nature of the forecasting required, the work of the RAO includes both long-termstudies and unforeseeable ad hoc investigations that require short or immediateturnaround times. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the SimplifiedAcquisition Procedures set forth FAR Part 13.Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing  to Russellyn R. Hartvia e-mail at Russellyn.Hart-1@nasa.gov or fax at 301-286-1720 (e-mail is preferred), nolater than April 16, 2008 at 4:00PM Eastern Standard Time (EST).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Plant Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with AMES, Inc. of Columbia, MD for three (3) Weil # 1622 pumps. Ames, Inc. is the sole Authorized Local Distributor for Weil pumps in Maryland and Washington D.C. 

These pumps are replacements for existing pumps in NIST Buildings 218 and 219.  The existing pumps mount on guide brackets and floor elbows unique to this manufacturer, therefore pumps from a manufacturer other than Weil will not function.

It is critical to the research to have 100% compatibility and interchangeability with the existing pumps already located at NIST. Without these we would not be allowed to operate in our 24/7 mode and we would incur significant downtime and additional expenses should these pumps malfunction.

The Weil #1622 pumps shall have a 35 foot cord, double mechanical seals, and sliding bracket.  Pump shall be 3 horsepower, capacity 100 GPM at 55 feet total dynamic head, 1750 RPM, 460/3/60 power.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 25, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC has a requirement for a contractor to provide services in support of the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) studies.  Services shall include the recruitment, screening, testing, scheduling, and payment, and other incidental support activities for paid volunteer subjects participating in human experimental studies.
Human research projects typically involve the controlled exposure of adults to environmental pollutants such as ozone, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, diesel exhaust, and noise, either alone or in combinations, and occasionally in combination with drugs or other substances; measurement of human effects endpoints associated with environmental exposures in the atmosphere; in vitro exposures of cells or fluids to known or suspected toxicant agents; physiological and neurobehavioral assessment of populations potentially exposed to toxicant agents; and/or pharmacokinetics and dosimetry studies that characterize the fate and clearance of environmental agents.  
The contractor shall maintain an on-site subject recruitment office at the EPA Human Facility located at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC.  It is anticipated that the Government will award a fixed price contract with a cost reimbursable line item.  The contract will contain a base statement of work and two optional tasks for special recruitment efforts.  Period of performance will be sixty months which is inclusive of a base period plus four twelve (12) month option periods.  The contract will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition.  The associated NAICS code is 541990 with a size standard of $6.5 million in average annual receipts over the preceding three fiscal years.  
The RFP is expected to be issued on or about May 1, 2008, and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>DustinTimmermann, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9125, Fax 618-229-9177, Email dustin.timmermann@disa.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to procure an award to Teralogics, LLC for the following requirement.  

Title: Unified Video Dissemination System (UVDS) 

Introduction: In 1998, the Defense Information Systems Agency was tasked by the Joint Staff to assist the Defense Mapping Agency (now known as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) and the US Air Force Predator Joint Program Office (JPO) with the development of an end-to-end Full Motion Video (FMV) Dissemination Methodology.  The system was successfully deployed in 2001 and has fulfilled the basic requirements for collection and dissemination of FMV for the Predator Program.  Since 2001, the Department of Defense (DoD) has expanded the number, type and capabilities of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) fleet to the point of rendering the initial FMV collection and dissemination system deployed in 2001 as obsolete.  The DoD, under the FY08 Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP) awarded funding to develop the next generation FMV collection, dissemination and exploitation system.  The DACP is a joint partnership between the DoD and the commercial industry.  DACP proposals are submitted to the Department of Defense Acquisition Technology & Logistics (DoD AT&L) under a DoD Service/Agency sponsorship and ranked by DoD based on the proposals technical merits and the proposals anticipated return on investment.  In 2007, 514 unique proposals were submitted, and the UVDS proposal submitted by Teralogics LLC was selected for funding.  

Background: The Global Broadcasting Service (GBS) Operational Requirements Document III, Net-Enabled Command Capabilities ORD, Net-Centric Enterprise Services ORD, Predator ORD II, along with numerous network operations documents require access to collect or disseminate unmanned aerial sensor (UAS) information and feeds. UAVs are now a core warfighting command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance asset.  Unlike other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors they provide a persistent, focused, real time, tactical information flow. Additionally, they provide Full Motion Video  a unique tool for ISR collection. As FMV has shown its utility as a warfighting asset, its role and usage has expanded, from purely a situational awareness tool to a tool used for sensor cueing, close air support, improvised explosive devise detection, bomb damage assessment, special operation forces ingress and egress and even targeting. There are a number of events in the public record showing the value of the predator and other UAVs.    

Requirement Objectives:  The task shall result in the risk-reduction prototype of a UVDS that can collect, disseminate, store, and search Full Motion Video streams that are received from the sensor at 30 frames per second in NTSC format.  

The UVDS shall result in a basic prototype effort that validates an Enterprise Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Full Motion Video (FMV) integration effort.  The contract will be broken up into a base year and one option year.  The base year effort will provide the initial capabilities of the UVDS system.  Option year 1 will integrate the system into the Defense Knowledge Online (DKO) portal; provide the full framework for integration of generic exploitation tools and provide a content management capability that will take advantage of the opportunistic data insertion capabilities of many of the DVB-S/S2 based IP SATCOM systems, such as GBS and the Joint IP Modem.

<DESC>Mobile District intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Doble Engineering Company for the lease of the following:  1.  M4000 Insulation Analyzer, one type M4000 test set with a capacity of 300 milliamperes at voltages from 2 to 12 kv, 60 Hertz, suitable for testing bushings, potheads, buswork, disconnect insulators, circuit breakers, instrument transformers, power transformers, lightning arresters, generator stator insulation, coupling capacitors, insulating liquid and askarels, and short lengths of station cables.   2.  M4110 Leakage Reactance Interface. 3.  Doble Test Assistant; 4.  M3000 Transport; 5.  Laboratory Analytical Services; 6.  SFRA Consulting Service.  The set will be used by the Hydropower Test Unit at West Point, Georgia as an aid in providing periodic maintenance of hydroelectric power projects.  The lease shall be for a period of one year.  The proposed contract action is for services which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Doble Engineering Company has been found to be the only company that can provide test equipment on a rental basis as well as provide engineering services on an as needed basis.  Leasing is more advantageous than purchasing the equipment because the Government obtains state of the art equipment as it comes available via the modification of the contract for upgrading equipment.  Doble also has the expertise for storage of data and provides the services of a Doble engineer for instructional purposes.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal.  However, the government will consider all proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received is solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, intends to award on a sole source basis to University of Delaware, Center for Applied Coastal Research, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Newark, Delaware 19716.  The work consists of 1. Model Coupling. a. Application of serial version of coupled system to demonstration site.  A serial version of a computational coupler (MASTER) has been developed that creates a coupled STWAVE-ADCIRC-CHL 2DH Shore Response Model system.  Contractor will assist in the application of the coupled system to a demonstration site. b. Development of parallelized computational coupler.  A model-coupling framework that dynamically links STWAVE with ADCIRC and the CHL 2DH Shore response model through a parallelized computational coupler (MASTER) will be developed. The integrated model is expected to run parallel ADCIRC versions and to capitalize on parallel efficiencies by coupling multiple single-thread STWAVE models in multiple domains.  The proposed two-way coupling scheme is based on a modern advanced method and will result in significant improvements in computational time when compared with the presently used approach.  The proposed parallel MASTER program approach is proposed is based on the serial code of the MASTER program.  The parallel version of the MASTER program (MASTER COUPLER) will be written using Message Passing Interface (MPI), and the MASTER COUPLER will control the interaction between the models.  The input files for STWAVE and ADCIRC will remain in the original formats to assure backwards compatibility. However, an extra input file including coupling control parameters will be required for parallel runs. All work will remain consistent with the SMS interface.  The primary deliverables are: (1) Source codes of a MASTER COUPLER program and the modified STWAVE, ADCIRC codes and input files. (2) Code testing on a Linux cluster or a UNIX system. (3) Users manual and technical report. 2.  Morphology Model Development a.  Merger of CSHORE (impermeable bottom) and CSHOREP (permeable bottom) to allow various applications of the merged CSHORE.  Applications range from dunes to rubble mound structures and levees. b.  Development of a time-averaged probabilistic model (swash model) for the prediction of wave overtopping flow in the intermittently wet and dry zone.  The model will be compared with laboratory experiments conducted by van Gent (Delft) who has provided his report and data.  He measured the water depth of the order of 1 cm and the fluid velocity of the order of 1 m/s in the thin layer of overtopping water on the crest and landward slope of dikes. c.  The swash model will be incorporated in the merged CSHORE and used to predict wave overwash and dune lowering.  The overwash model will be compared with the laboratory experiment completed in FY07 at Oregon State.  Additional experiments are being prepared at UD to commence in Spring. d.  The 2D model based on STWAVE, STCIRC and sediment modules is being evaluated against CSHORE and the dune erosion data obtained in 2007 in terms of its capability for predicting the spatially-detailed variations in the surf and swash zones.  The circulation parts of CSHORE and STCIRC are the same in theory but the numerical details are not the same.  The verified 2D model will eventually be used for the prediction of dune breaching.  The primary deliverables are (1) Source code of merged CSHORE with dune erosion (within month). (2) Source code of new CSHORE with overwash and dune lowering (3) Source code for 2DH coupled wave, circulation and  morphology model, (4) Technical report documenting the model theory, development, and validation on the basis of more than 10 journal and conference papers as well as CACR technical reports and (5).CSHORE Users manual.   No RFP will be issued based on this notice.  However, all information received within five (5) calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Multinuclear Broadband NMR Probe and an Automated Sample Changer.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for a Multinuclear Broadband NMR Probe and an Automated Sample Changer that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. 

This requirement is for a Multinuclear Broadband NMR Probe and an Automated Sample Changer to be used in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) facility at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, SC.  These accessories will provide additional capability in two ares: automated sample analysis and in multi-nuclear NMR research on a wide array of NMR visible nuclei.

The required probe will be used for observation of NMR visible nuclei between the frequency of Phosporus-31 and Silver-109, with the possibility of observation of a few nuclei below this frequency range which will be installed on an existing Bruker Biospin Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument at 800 Megahertz (MHz).  This probe must interface with the existing equipment. It must work with the control electronics of the existing equipment, including probe identification (PICS), temperature control stability (BTO), automated tuning and matching (ATM) and an actively shielded z-gradient coil.  

The robotic sample changing devise will be used to provide the capability of automated sample handling and data collection. This device will be connected and interoperate with an existing NMR instrument and it must interface properly with the existing equipment. The sample changer must be under software control from the NMR instrument to properly sequence and handle samples. This involves complex software, electrical and mechanical interconnections.  The device must interoperate with Bruker TopSpin software, allow a user to automatically perform experiments on up to 120 samples, allow random sequencing of samples and have the capability through additional add-on accessories (not being procured at this time) for positive sample identification and sample temperature control.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture Multinuclear Broadband NMR Probe and an Automated Sample Changer are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the specimen handlers for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the specimen handlers, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), located at Research Triangle Park, NC, is one of the 27 Institutes and centers composing the National Institutes of Health.  Human health and human disease result from three interactive elements: environmental exposures, individual susceptibility and time. The NIEHS mission is to reduce the burden of human illness and dysfunction from environmental exposures by understanding each of these elements and how they interrelate. NIEHS achieves its mission, in part, through basic and applied research into the effects of environmental exposures on biological systems and human health, on the identification of susceptible human sub populations and on the interaction between the environment, genetics, and age.  Government-owned Packard instruments are used to conduct basic and applied research.   Preventive maintenance and repairs for these instruments is provided for under contract, which will expire on June 30, 2008.  The NIEHS intends to continue this service and the purpose of this announcement is to identify potential small business sources.

<DESC>The United States Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle ManagementCommand in support of the Armament, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) has a requirement for technical support on the aircraft software development, integration, software test analysis and requirement verification during software test demonstrations in support of the AH-64D Longbow Apache programs. The Apache Attack Helicopter is a highly integrated complex platform currently entering Extended Block II (EBII) multi-year production procurement that requires unique expertise in support of the software development, integration and testing of the onboard mission equipment package and training device suite. To support the Longbow Apache the contractor has to be intimately knowledgeable of the AH-64D Block I, AH-64D Block II and the AH-64D Block III avionic architecture, computer software configuration items (CSCIs) and verification processes. There is a continuing effort through the EBII procurement to implement and provide enhanced capabilities to include: Variable Message Format/Situation Awareness to support Army Software Blocking, Weapon System enhancements, UAV Control and other crew station enhancements to reduce crew workload that will be applicable to both the Block I & II aircraft baselines. Concurrently with the EBII effort, the Apache Project Managers Office (PMO) is managing the Longbow Apache Block III program during the system development and demonstration phase which this office also provides support for. To support this development there will be incremental OFP releases to support the flight test program where domain knowledge of the system is critical to provide the necessary technical support in a timely manner. Consequently the contractor will be required to support the computer resources effort immediately after contract award to include software development, integration and verification efforts as critical program milestones in place by the Apache PMO.
Specific services include:  
a) To provide technical expertise in the evaluation of aircraft Display processor, System processor, Weapons processor and Mission processor CSCI software requirements, analysis of test results and verification of requirements; b) Support software test environment testing, avionics integration lab testing and aircraft testing as required; c) Support the development and verification of the software requirements, lab and aircraft testing of the Radar Electronics Unit (REU) component of the Fire Control Radar; d) Support the Kuwait unique FMS Longbow Apache Block II OFP baseline; e) Review of software CDRLs upon completion of a Software Baseline Verification Test.
Be advised that this is not a request for the submission of offers or proposals; no contract award will be made as a result of this notice. Interested parties are highly encouraged to provide a description of capabilities statement not to exceed 20 pages.  At a minimum, responses shall address technical ability to perform, ability to perform immediately after contract award, and knowledge of the Longbow Apache architecture, software development process, software verification methods and subsystems.

<DESC>Using contract M67854-07-C-8006, awarded sole-source on 5/3/2007 to FAAC, Inc., 1229 Oak Valley Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48108, the U.S. Marine Corps has acquired the USMC-ODS (formerly Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement ODS) to provide entry and sustainment-level operator driver simulation training. The USMC-ODS is a unique system that offers a vehicle training platform unlike any other the Marine Corps maintains.  Each Student Training Station (STS) consists of a generic cab that houses vehicle-specific dash panels, pedals, and appended armor kits (for field of view) that replicate the vehicles form, feel, and function.  The system utilizes three visual channels to display the virtual world and a partial-motion platform that works in conjunction with a software-based dynamic dataset to simulate the actual driving experience in the virtual environment.  This system can be contained in either a fixed location or a mobile trailer.  The trailer can hold up to two STSs an! d an Instructor/Operator Station (IOS).  Since its development, the training capability has been expanded to include additional vehicles.  In addition to the original MTVR, the USMC-ODS now offers the MTVR with MTVR Armor System (MAS), Highly Mobile Multiple Wheeled (HMMWV), Up-Armored HMMWV, and the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Category I Cougar.  Under the original contract, the ODS system was procured to support units on each of the major Active Duty Bases in the continental United States and select Marine Forces Reserve.  Since contract award and fielding of the systems, both Active Duty and MARFORRES units have expressed the desire to procure more ODS systems and to further expand its training capability by including additional MRAP variants.  Therefore, an increase in the value of contract M67854-07-C-8006 is anticipated (~$10.8 million) to procure additional ODS systems and to expand its training capability in include additional MRAP variants.  Contractors ! with the capability to meet specified requirements should provide a response indicating their ability to do so. The anticipated delivery date for this effort is 30 Sep 08.  This request in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this notice will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  All interested contractors shall submit a written response to Graham Oliff within 30 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Command Southeast Region has a requirement for Right Talus fresh tissue graft. The Government intends to award a sole source purchase order for this requirement.  The suggested contractor is Joint Restoration Foundation, 6278 South Troy Circle, Centennial, CO 80111-6422. <BR>Description is as follows:<BR><BR>The talus is the tarsal homologue of the carpal lunate. The fundamental difference between these two homologous structures derives from the weight-bearing function of the talus: in the bipedal stance and gait pattern typical of humans, the talus is the only bone through which the entire body weight load is channeled, before being distributed to the arches of the foot. The right talus is a part of the right ankle region. <BR>This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time.  This information will be reviewed by the Government technical representatives for consideration for future requirements.  <BR> <BR>

(v)The contract line item number are:  CLIN 0001, purchase of Upgrade to Naval Aerodynamic Test Facility (NATF) Wind Tunnel.

(vi)  Description of Requirements:  The contract requires support for the Naval Aerodynamic Test Velocity Measurement Upgrade Program (432A).  This acquisition will provide support for the process of enhancing its data acquisition, flow field diagnostics, and wind tunnel control capabilities for the Naval Aerodynamic Test Facility (NATF) wind tunnel.  The NATF enhancements will be for the purchase of a three-component Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV), upgrade or replacement of an existing GFE PSI 8400 system, replacement of current wind tunnel drive with a variable frequency drive, purchase of a multi-hole unsteady cobra pressure probe, and replacement tunnel data acquisition software and computers.  It is expected that the data acquisition software will control/acquire data from existing GFE systems in the NATF and must be able to do every process currently associated with the legacy NATF control system: wind tunnel speed command/control of the new variable frequency drive (VFD) including emergency stop, data acquisition, and traverse command and control.  The bidder must submit a plan describing VFD installation, implementation and fan/speed control.  The system must be able to control all instruments from the facility control room.  Software may be written to control/interface with existing GFE systems or the GFE systems may be upgraded if that is more cost effective.  The system must be designed such that, in the event of communication failure with the VFD a runaway fan is not possible.  The final operating system will have sufficiently low electronic noise for the entire system to operate without noise interference will all systems operating.  This may require contractor to install shielding and to demonstrate system integration/acquisition of the existing facility instrumentation, control of the facility drive, and integration/acquisition of the procured instrumentation.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractors Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 14 APR 2008, 5:00 P.M.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to procure Contractor Services for a Maritime Secuirty Cutter Medium (WMSM) Speed Analysis.  This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Therefore, please read this entire notice, the instructions herein, and the attachment documents carefully.  This acquisition is on an Unrestricted basis.  

SCOPE:

Background
The ability of the Coast Guard to acquire major systems that meet operational mission needs within cost and schedule constraints begins with the establishment of operational performance requirements.  The Sponsor establishes absolute minimums (thresholds) below which the mission can not be successfully performed.  The Sponsor also sets objectives to define a value beyond the threshold that reflects an operationally meaningful and cost effective increment to an operationally effective system.  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) prioritizes the various requirements to guide future trade off analyses.  
The Office of Cutter Forces (CG-751) would like to have a contractor provide support for the analysis task of determining the objective and threshold speed requirements for the WMSMs effectiveness to meet overarching mission requirements.  The contractor will provide analysis support to the United States Coast Guard (CG-751) for a speed analysis of the WMSM.  The analysis will be conducted across the spectrum of WMSM operations / missions to support the threshold and objective values selected for required performance parameters to be included in the WMSM ORD.  The contractor will assist CG-751 staff by providing an experienced operational team knowledgeable in: concept of operations, modeling and simulation, alternatives analysis, and decision support to effectively communicate the operational utility of WMSM speed options to the user community and to the acquisition chain.  In addition, the contractor will identify risks associated with the various speed options that are developed.  

Develop WMSM Design Reference Mission Operating Scenarios 
Using WMSM Mission Needs Statement (MNS), WMSM Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and proposed WMSM homeporting plans, the contractor will develop four WMSM design reference mission (DRM) operating scenarios.  Input into DRM scenario development will be obtained from Coast Guard subject matter experts in operational and support commands.   This task requires an in-depth knowledge of Coast Guard operations and the Coast Guard's Deepwater missions, mission threats, operating environment, system of proposed assets and capabilities, legacy assets and capabilities, and concepts of operation (CONOPS).  It also requires significant experience in developing DRMs and CONOPS for major acquisition programs.
Deliverable:  A report detailing the four DRM scenarios with supporting justification for speed in a MS Word format.
Due Date:  2 months following contract award. 

Facilitate Collaborative Event to Determine the Requirements Related to WMSM Operating Speed
Conduct and facilitate a group decision support session among the community of stakeholders to identify the essential requirements for WMSM speed threshold and objectives.  The contractor will serve as overall event coordinator and facilitator to lead and mentor group discussions while keeping to critical event timelines and maintaining a focus on workshop objectives.  Additionally, the facilitator will serve to frame and help codify the issues to ensure that all perspectives are represented and captured.  The contractor shall utilize a collaborative software tool to capture participants inputs, manage content and accelerate brainstorming and collaboration.  This effort will produce a consensus list of essential, operationally sound requirements for WMSM speed thresholds and objectives.  This task requires skilled facilitators who are practiced in the art of leading a group of multiple stakeholders to reach consensus on key issues.  It calls for skill in designing a structured, collaborative process to elicit maximum performance of the group.  Practical experience in structured electronic brainstorming and idea generation using collaborative software tools and a facility (with appropriate tools) for hosting an offsite event are a necessity.  Subject matter expertise in requirements development is also a capability requirement.       

Deliverable:  A MS PowerPoint brief to CG-751 of the collaborative meeting results and all accompanying notes in MS Word format.
Due Date:  3 months following contract award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

DCHA/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service. The Division supports a majority program-funded workforce in the areas of administrative support, financial management of OTI program funds, human resource assistance for program-funded personnel, information and technology operations and programmatic support for Washington and the field, and procurement tracking of OTI program-funded activities.

Within the Operations and Management Division, the Information and Technology Team (IT Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to business process and information management. The IT team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises.  The goal of the IT team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support information management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through analyzing business process and information management needs in order to institute and maintain office-wide systems, processes, practices and procedures that support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.  

Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.

INTRODUCTION

The incumbent serves as the Program Manager for Information and Technology (IT), reporting to the Technology Specialist (IT Team Leader) or his/her designee, in the Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI).  

The Program Manager for IT supports DCHA/OTI's Senior Leadership, the three other divisions of DCHA/OTI (the Field Programs Division, Program Office Team, Operations and Management Division), and all field programs (under the Field Programs Division) with responsibility in the areas of information systems (such as systems analysis and database design), and in program management (such as backstopping support for field teams and reporting).  

The incumbent has a direct role in both the operations and the program activities of DCHA/OTI, learning from both in order to develop more effective systems and processes. The incumbent will, as needed, serve as an integral part of the DCHA/OTI country program activities as well as develop and maintain the systems that individuals in those program roles will use. This involves short-term assignments to backstop or assist Program Managers and others in the country program team or Operations team when required in order to better understand the existing business processes, information flows, and types of data managed. This analysis should lead to the development of improved information system tools supporting the program.  

The incumbent will gain a deep understanding of OTI's operational and programmatic goals and combine this knowledge with a strong background in information technology to provide consultation on the development of OTI's information systems.

OTI uses a Microsoft Access database to track and report on country program small grants and other activities. The database system gives OTI an ability to manage and explain to others a diverse portfolio of OTI activities in many countries. The incumbent will: provide support to OTI and Implementing Partner staff overseas as well as Washington-based staff; create enhancements to the program and ensure that the system maintains consistency with the program strategies and structures in each OTI country; and support and review the processes inherent in program management that maintain information flow to OTI managers, partners and stakeholders.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this solicitation is to hire a Program Manager for Information and Technology to support OTI staff and programs.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the incumbent is expected to operate with certain levels of autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with sound judgment, good teamwork, interpersonal, and analytical skills while also possessing a well-developed understanding of US policy interests. The incumbent must have a strong background and interest in information system design. The incumbent must also have experience and interest in program implementation, and be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the incumbent must be highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The specific duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

This includes but is not limited to providing small group or one-on-one training, and writing end-users documentation. 

* Participate in technology assessments and design of information systems related to OTI's management activities. These special projects may include: operational and programmatic information systems such as personnel, inventory, scheduling, annual reports, web-based OTI information and country program summaries; programmatic tactical technology solutions such as PDA solutions, wireless and web-based systems. 

* Provide technical assistance to OTI web coordinators in maintaining OTI's various web sites on the agency's Internet, extranet and intranet web servers. 

* Coordinate with the USAID Office of Information Resources Management and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in their provision of IT support to OTI, to leveraging existing agency IT resources and maximize the effect of OTI's independent resources. 

* Explore opportunities to incorporate new technologies to improve OTI's capability to meet its operational and programmatic objectives world wide, under the direction of the Technology Sector Specialist. 

* Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of the OTI mandate, as requested by the Technology Sector Specialist.

* Travel overseas in fulfillment of duties as required.

B.	GS-12 EQUIVALENT

At the GS-12 level, incumbent will perform all of the above duties for a GS-11 level, but with greater independence of action. In addition, duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* Review Agency systems/requirements to find ways to seamlessly integrate OTI's systems into these systems, while also reducing redundancies in OTI systems whenever Agency systems are modified.

* Undertake special projects to evaluate existing programs and to assess appropriate changes to OTI information management systems, or adjustments to program processes that will result in improved program performance and effectiveness. 

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Program Manager for Information and Technology will take direction from and will report to the Technology Specialist or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

While we can emulate the curve portrayed in Figure 3 of theSpecification, our device has far greater capability operating in the Force vs. Velocitymode. The energy absorber simultaneously possesses the characteristic modes of velocitysquared, viscous, and dashpot damping. The predominant mode of performance is naturallyadaptive to the bi-directional velocities of compression or extension. Is yoursolicitation sufficiently flexible to permit the offering of this alternate dampingtechnology?Answer:   Struts with performance having a strong dependency on velocity may not alsohave a constant load versus displacement characteristic.  Proposals in response to thissolicitation will be evaluated on constant load versus displacement performancecharacteristics at the loads specified.   Performance characteristics that differ fromthat specified may be more difficult for NASA to conduct individual strut   characterization tests and develop analytical models and thereby reduce the ability tomeasure attenuation system performance from the impact tests.The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.

<DESC>Synopsis/solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG is hereby amended to answer questions received from interested parties.  The due date is NOT extended.  All other articles remain unchanged.
1.  Question:  In regards to the measurement of As, Se and Zn by INAA, what are the required or desired detection limits (measurement sensitivity) for each of these elements for this study?

Answer:  Using neutron activation analysis (NAA), arsenic has been quantified at levels above the detection limit in almost all toenail samples measured with this method.  The issue of detection limits was therefore not of concern when we decided that NAA was preferred, for the reasons noted below.

2.  Question:  Solicitation RFQ-NCI-60047-NG requests neuron activation analysis of toenail clippings for arsenic, selenium, and zinc.  This email is written to identify whether inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-Ms) would be an acceptable alternative. 

Answer:  

i.    The Government assumes that the question pertains to neutron activation analysis (NAA), not neuron activation analysis, as in the question.     
ii.   A non-destructive analytical method was chosen, so as to preserve the specimens for future analyses of other factors.
iii.  NAA was selected to permit the measurements to be fully compatible with closely related studies conducted in New England.
iv.  NAA has often been used in analyses of toenails for the purpose of exposure assessment in studies of arsenic-exposed populations.  In these populations, toenail arsenic is correlated with other, independent measures of arsenic exposure.

3.  Question:  One must wonder why NAA was selected here, other than the fact that it is a non-destructive technique.  Few labs have access to a nuclear reactor for anything like the kind of time necessary to measure these elements in this number of specimens, and those that do may lack the validation for these clinical matrices.  NAA may yet prove to be cost prohibitive.  How was NAA selected for this RFQ.  Was any thought given to other analytical approaches?

Answer:  See answer to question 2 above.

4.  Question:  I had wondered why NCI would even bother trying to assess trace element exposure using toenails.  We know that nails are an unreliable matrix (non-homogeneous trace element distribution), subject to unknown exogenous contamination and, washing procedures notwithstanding, subject to leaching of bound metals.

It seems to me that serum and/or plasma specimens would yield more reliable estimates of Zn and Se nutritional status.  As for as exposure, timed urine specimens (or a spot urine corrected for creatinine excretion) would make better sense.  Yes, as is excreted slowly in nails and hair making a cumulative assessment potential feasible.  Unfortunately, the quality of this specimen (toenail) must surely negate any potential gains.  Since national databases exists for serum Se, Zn and As, they might prove better benchmarks with which to compare local data.

Answer:  Our primary interest is in assessing long-term cumulative exposure to arsenic among individuals in a specific study population.  For this purpose, toenails from study subjects are preferable to other biologic samples that would provide estimates of temporally proximate exposures.  Spot urine samples were also collected from all subjects, and overnight urine and blood samples were collected from a random sample of respondents.  Arsenic speciation has been completed for all urine samples, along with creatinine concentrations.

STATEMENT OF WORK: Measurement of Arsenic, Selenium, and Zinc in Toenail Samples from a Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in New England using Neutron Activation Analysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water is associated with elevated risk of several internal cancers, and in particular, bladder cancer.  The observation that bladder cancer risk is elevated subsequent to arsenic ingestion comes from studies in several populations worldwide, including Southwest Taiwan, Northeast Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Cordoba Province of Argentina.  These populations historically have been exposed to very high levels of arsenic in their drinking water, and dramatic risk elevations are observed, with relative risks ranging from 3 or 4 to 15, compared to populations with low levels of arsenic in their drinking water.  Exposures in these regions of the world ranged between 200 ug/L to 1500 ug/L.  
	
The National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School and several state Departments of Health, has completed the field work in a large case-control study of bladder cancer in Northern New England (Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire).  This study was motivated by the persistent elevated rates of bladder cancer mortality and incidence in these three states.  Reasons for this elevation are poorly understood.  

Arsenic in drinking water has emerged as a leading hypothesis that may explain the excess bladder cancer in New England.  Low- to moderate levels of arsenic in bedrock aquifers used for drinking water, especially in private wells, occur in extended parts of the region.   Based on what is known about the distribution of arsenic in Northern New England, and assuming a straight line extrapolation from the well-established risk of bladder cancer observed at high levels of exposure, the excess risk in rural areas appears to fit the expected level of risk.  However, to date there have been no reliable assessments of bladder cancer risk in populations exposed to the lower levels of arsenic in water that are found in New England, and evaluation of this is an important part of the design of the NCI epidemiologic study.   

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT:  The main objective is to determine levels of arsenic, selenium, and zinc in toenail samples collected from subjects who participated in a case-control study of bladder cancer.  The data will be used to estimate exposure to these elements in the context of the case-control study.  

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall:	

1	Analyze samples for the presence and concentration of arsenic (As), selenium (Se), and Zinc (Zn) using nuclear activation analysis (NAA).  

2	Prepare all samples as necessary (routine analysis) prior to NAA analysis.  

3	Contractor shall specify whether cleaning of samples prior to analysis is included in the proposal.  If cleaning is included in the proposal, the cost shall be identified as a separately priced line item. 

4	In the case-control study, toenail samples were collected from 2,545 participants.  The weight of each sample is not yet available, and some samples may fall below the minimum required for adequate NAA analysis.  Under the assumption that all samples meet the minimum weight requirements for analysis, 2,545 sample analyses will be required.  In addition, 10% (255 samples) randomly selected samples of adequate size will be split and blindly submitted for quality assurance (QA) purposes.  Thus the maximum number of analyses, including QA samples will be 2,800.  All analyses must be completed, with results submitted, no later than eight (8) months after the start date of this contract.  Higher throughput, which would permit completion of analyses no later than six (6) months after contract initiation, will be to the advantage of the contracting laboratory.

The contractor shall provide a detailed description of quality control/quality assurance procedures that are used for preparation and analysis of blanks and standardized samples.  

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: 

1	The Contractor shall electronically communicate results of all analyses, including quality control information, to the NCI Project Officer on a weekly basis, using an Excel format to be provided by NCI. Problems or delays relating to any aspect of these analyses shall be reported to the NCI Project Officer as soon as noted by the contractor. 

2	Contractor shall provide a summary report of progress, study management, problems, and their resolution, to NCI on a monthly basis, to commence the beginning of the first month after samples have been received by the contractor.  

3	The report shall include, but not be limited to: Counts of the numbers of samples received, analyzed, and whose results were reported in the monthly reporting period, as well as totals to date.  
		
4	The Contractor shall provide a final report to NCI at the conclusion of all analyses which shall include summaries of these same data.  

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: NCI will provide to the contractor toenail samples collected from study subjects in the period 2002-2005.  If cleaning of samples is not included in an offerors proposal, this will be done by the Government prior to shipment.   In addition to original samples, an additional 10% of the samples will be blinded replicates, indistinguishable from the original samples.  These blinded replicates will be submitted to the contractor for quality control purposes.

Samples will be shipped to the contractor from NCI's sample repository in batches to be determined by consultation and agreement between NCI and the contractor, and at a frequency to be determined in like manner.   Prior to shipment of samples from the NCI repository to the contractor, the batch size used in analysis will be communicated to NCI to permit the rational organization of QA samples.   The weight of each sample shipped from NCI shall be no less than 10 mg. 

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  Within two weeks of submission of data to NCI, the Project Officer will review the data submitted to NCI by the contractor, and inform the contractor of any anomalies found and/or corrective action required

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 1, 2006  January 31, 2007.  NOTE:  Offerors may propose a shorter delivery schedule and will be given additional technical points if this shorter delivery schedule is proposed.

TITLE:  B-2 TRAINING SYSTEM NOTICE OF SITE VISIT TO THEB-2 TRAINING SYSTEM (TS) RECOMPETE. QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED AT THE SITE VISIT TO THE WEAPON SYSTEM SUPPORT CENTER (WSSC) AT TINKER AIR FORCE BASE (AFB)
DESCRIPTION:  THE FOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWERWERE PROVIDED TO THE ATTENDEES.  PLEASE CONTACT BETTY.CLINGERMAN@WPAFB.AF.MIL AND LUKE.SCHULTZ@WPAFB.AF.MIL REGARDING ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
SPECIFIC QUESTION AND ANSWER PROVIDED TO ATTENDEES:
DOES THE CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGE REVIEW BOARD?
The purpose of the Software Change Review Board (SCRB, scrub)is to determine what B-2 software problems or discrepancies get fixed or resolved.  Software problems are written up as Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs).  The SCRB meets twice per year at Whiteman Air Force Base. The meetings are at Whiteman to assure Wing and aircrew participation.  The person facilitating the meeting is from the 556 ACSS/GFEAB at Tinker Air Force Base. The SCRB reviews and scores existing SSTRs and ranks or priorities the SSTRs.  ACC makes the final decision regarding the SSTRs to be worked by the 556 ACSS and scheduled for implementation in the jet.  The Training System prime contractor as part of the Concurrency Management also reviews and tracks SSTRs for impact to the Training System and participates in the SCRB to be aware of the SSTRs being implemented in the jet so that they can coincidentally be implemented in the Training System.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is about to solicit proposals from all interested organizations for a study entitled: CHEARS (Children Ebstein's Anomaly Research Study).  Specifically, a contractor will be selected to assist in the recruitment of approximately 900 families over a three year period from communities in Ukraine. Children with Ebstein's anomaly/tricuspid valve disease (referred to as case) will be recruited to the study, as will their parents. Controls will be recruited from the same neighborhoods as the cases (children with Ebstein's anomaly) and will also include the parents. Controls will be matched by age, sex and region of origin to cases in a ratio of two (2) controls for each case. If neither parent is available, at least one other blood relative will be recruited in place of the parents. The more general diagnosis of tricuspid valve disease is to be included in the selection of participants, since often those with mild forms of Ebstein's are not appropriately diagnosed. The subjects will be interviewed by a physician, and medically evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.  Blood, cheek and saliva tissue samples will be collected to obtain DNA for a genome wide association analysis. Usually each family will only need to be seen once. A goal of CHEARS, although not a requirement to be performed or funded as part of this acquisition, is the identification of the genetic basis for Ebstein's anomaly, a birth defect involving malformation of the tricuspid valve of the heart.  Such findings may yield insight into disease mechanisms that may provide novel diagnostic tools as well as therapeutic strategies for medical remediation of this often life threatening and debilitating congenital heart disease. (The analyses associated with the collection of samples will take place at the NHLBI.)
The Government anticipates that one contract will be awarded for a three-year duration. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712. The Request for Proposals, numbered RFP-NHLBI-HL-08-20, will be available on or about April 8, 2008 on the FedBizOpps Web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  See the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Rockledge Drive Bethesda postings. Proposals will be due on or about May 22, 2008. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment #001, is to provide responses to questions submitted under Solicitation N00244-08-T-0286 as follows:
1. Question:  Beside pricing the equipment listed, are we also to provide cost and pricing for installation of both sites?(NAS Fallon Fairview)(Newpass Peak).
Answer:  No, the Government will do the installation.  
2.  Question: Is there road access to each of these sites?
Answer:  Yes, there is a dirt/rock road.  Not probably large enough for a large truck.
3.  Question:  Are there existing structures to support these 10' antennas? (one at each site)
Answer:  Yes, these dishes being purchased are replacing other dishes.
4.  Question: Are there structures in place to install the microwave equipment?
Answer:  Yes, there is an existing tower, the Government will replace the existing Alcatel Radios, DS-3.  5.  Question:  Are there existing power supplies in the structures to power the microwave radios?
Answer: Yes, we have the same power sources from the previous radios (-48V DC).  6.  Question: Could you please provide Latitude and Longitude for each site?  Elevation, and antenna structures heights would be good to have as well.
Answer:  New Pass Peak: N 39d38m48.1sW117d29m5.0sElevation. 8957 ftAntenna height: 20.2 ft.
Fair View Peak:N 39d13m30.3sW 118d09m9.3sElevation: 8301 ftAntenna Height: 25ft
These are approximate values (Elv. And Height).  These values are from the current DS-3 link that is up.
The time and date for receipt of the proposal, 1:00PM local time, 4/17/2008 remain unchanged.

<DESC><p>The Presolicitation Notices posted under YA1323-08-RD-0002 and YA1323-08-RD-0003 refer to same Government Requirement (R&amp;D 2013). These Notices are listed under 2 different solictaiton numbers because the system did not allow notices to be issued under more than one naics code.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND The U.S. Census Bureau's mission is to collect and disseminate timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States. Over 200 years ago, the United States Constitution laid the foundation for what is today one of the world's largest and most comprehensive data gathering organizations. Every month, quarter, and year, the Census Bureau plans and conducts over 100 sample surveys that update and add to information from the economic census (taken every five years) and the population census (taken every ten years). These data collections would be impossible without continuous research and development. The Census Bureau's core business is conducting large-scale surveys and censuses. This includes a full range of activities required to produce data, including list development, sample selection and estimation, questionnaire design, enumeration, and data capture, processing, tabulation, analysis and dissemination. To remain preeminent in this field, we must conduct scientific research and technological development to support our capabilities to carry out the tasks for surveys and censuses. We must research methodological and statistical advances that may reduce cost and resources and improve quality. We must stay abreast of the latest technological advances through assessment and conduct research on the use of such technology to take advantage of its capabilities. We must be aware of our customers' and respondents' concerns and willingness to participate. We must evaluate programs and practices to determine if they are achieving desired results at a reasonable cost, especially in light of the current environment of cost effective government programs. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&amp;D) 2013 MARKET RESEARCH REQUEST FOR INFORMATION The U.S. Census Bureau intends to conduct market research with companies/organizations performing research and development to learn more about the industry and best practices currently performed that may be similar in magnitude to a forthcoming Bureau project. The latter will assist the Bureau in understanding how to ensure small businesses are provided opportunities to the maximum extent possible for the purpose of this project. The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the R&amp;D 2013 requirement. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Bureau. The Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer. This Market Research information does not commit the Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Census Bureau is not responsible for any administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this request. Although answers to these questions are optional, the Bureau will appreciate and encourages companies to submit responses based on their knowledge and experience in the field of research and development. Based on the information provided, and as part of its ongoing market research, the Bureau may contact individual respondents for additional information. All information provided will be kept confidential and will be utilized for market research purposes directly related to the Research and Development (R&amp;D) 2013 requirement. INSTRUCTIONS The official website for the R&amp;D 2013 contract has been created and can be accessed at http://www.census.gov/procur/www/rd2013. Industry representatives are encouraged to visit the website to view the draft statement of work and complete the above-mentioned market research survey. Please submit your market research responses by 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time on April 16, 2008.</p>

LEED credits are available for a 17.5% reduction which is automatically achieved when one complies with the 30% reduction called for in EPACT 2005.  The 17.5% energy consumption reduction listed in the LEED credit table in section 1020 13.2.1 is a listing of the credits as applicable to LEED certification and does not reduce the requirements of EPACT 2005.  All bidders should comply with the specifications which require EPACT 2005 compliance.
