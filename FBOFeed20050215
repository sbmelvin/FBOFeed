<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for aircraft support for the research project “Canadian Arctic and Greenland Ice Field Surveys”.  This project has as its main focus airborne remote sensing measurements of surface and bed topography and ice characteristics in areas of the Canadian Arctic and Greenland where the ice cover is changing dramatically.  The remote sensing instruments will map in detail surface elevations along specific transects over selected areas in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland.  The surface elevations will be mapped using NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) laser altimeter system, and the underlying bedrock and internal ice measurements will be made with an ice penetrating radar that has been a part of the NASA ice surveying suite of instruments for the last decade.  Measurements must begin around the first of May and be completed no later than June 15th to avoid seasonal weather characteristics that will greatly complicate extraction of a long-term elevation change signal because it may be largely masked by the seasonal melt.   The aircraft to be provided for this project must already be authorized to operate with Ice Penetrating Radar antennas affixed to the underside of the wings to accommodate one of the provided instruments.  In addition, the aircraft must have a Standard Photoport suitable for ATM laser system operation. The aircraft crew will be required to fly low-altitude missions (500 meters above ground level) over remote ice caps in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland.  As such, the contractor must have extensive experience surveying remote glaciers and ice caps using laser altimetry at low altitudes in remote areas with a minimum of support using appropriate aircraft.  The contractor must be very familiar with the geography and flying conditions of the Canadian Arctic and Greenland, and must have experience operating in the northern part of the Nunavut Territory of Canada.  Experience conducting laser altimetry surveys in Polar Regions is mandatory.  The contractor must have recent experience performing work under contract for United States government agencies, and be capable of meeting NASA aircraft safety requirements in a very short time (on the order of one month), due to the significant seasonal constraints discussed above. NASA/GSFC/WFF intends to purchase the items from Kenn Borek Air Ltd. of Canada under 10 USC 2304 (c)(1)-only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  Kenn Borek Air is the only known source for the required service meeting all the requirements detailed above. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 2, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

Suite 208, Bellevue, WA 98005 for Healthprolink Remote System Quantifi software to include an HPL-RS ADT System Interface to VistA (Enterprise Edition Version v3.6.2.0103).  This is a web-based clinical workload management & documentation system for pharmacies that will be installed on two VISN-2 servers and configured to run over the VISN-2 WAN, rather than through an ASP configuration.

Product also has an interface to Lexicomp drug information system that can be used to research medication information while in the system documentation window.    NAICS code 541511 applies.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice is not a request for offers; however, all interested parties who believe they can meet our requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information about their product(s).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract, based on responses to this notice, is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Information received will generally only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responses must be in writing and submitted to the contracting officer no later than 2:00 PM EST on March 1, 2005.

The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses.

<CONTACT>Charles  Bright, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7322, Fax 813-828-7504, Email brightc@socom.mil - Valerie Romanchek, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7335, Fax 813-828-7504, Email romancv@socom.mil
<DESC>Broad Area Announcement (BAA), Biometric Identification Targeting Exploitation (BITE).  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA 05-01) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.    Specifically, this announcement describes the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) plans for industry involvement in support of Biometric Identification Targeting Exploitation (BITE).  USSOCOM is soliciting proposals directed at BITE research focusing on the need for a portable capability to identify (in near real-time) personnel of interest when encountered.   

The desired capability will validate and demonstrate sensing products that will identify a person or persons of interest entering or leaving an area of concern.  One objective is to demonstrate contact/close-in methods of validating identity (i.e., compare one subject to a target data profile, or compare one subject to many target data profiles).  A second objective is to demonstrate remote (distances greater than 300 meters) methods of validating identity.  The third objective is to demonstrate remote methods of identifying targets from a select group of target data profiles (compare subject to most-wanted list) at distances greater than 50 meters.  

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described in this BAA.     

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.    In order to conserve valuable offeror and Government resources, prospective offerors shall first submit an initial proposal.   
The initial proposal shall not exceed fifteen pages of text that describes the following:  1) The research objective, 2) The research approach, 3) Related work by the investigator or proposer, 4) Anticipated contributions to biometrics identification, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 6) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) should be appended together with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the initial proposal submission.  

Formal full proposal (cost and technical proposals) for competitive review will be requested based upon those initial proposal submissions judged to be within the scope of this BAA, that do not duplicate existing research, and/or that are of a technology of interest.   An invitation does not assure an offeror of a subsequent contract award. 

All offers must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.     

USSOCOM encourages Educational Institutions, Small Businesses (SBs), Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns (SDBs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) to submit proposals under this BAA.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. 

Prospective contractors must complete electronic representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The representations and certifications must be updated as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate and complete. (See FAR Subpart 4.12).

The full proposal submission will be evaluated on the following evaluation criteria:  1) Scientific and technical merits of the research, 2) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the research, 3) Relevance of the proposed research to Biometric Identification, and 4) Realism of the proposed costs.  

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication in this Federal Business Opportunities webpage.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed earlier rather than later within this one (1) period.  

Updated information for this BAA is contained on http://soal.socom.mil/ssi.  On this page, you will see an odometer-like section where you can "dial-in" an access code.  Use the Up and Down links to dial-in 11111 .  This will take you to the BAA page.  Click on the Files link and you will get to the page where the files for download will be.  (Note: disregard the Source Selection Information disclaimers)

All initial proposals must be forwarded to following address:  U.S. Special Operations Command, ATTN:  SOAL-KBC (Mr. Charles Bright), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL  33621-5323 or via e-mail to brightc@socom.mil.   Any additional questions relating to this BAA should be directed to U.S. Special Operations Command, ATTN:  SOAL-KBC (Mr. Charlie Bright), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL  33621-5323 or via e-mail to brightc@socom.mil. 

USSOCOM will award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances. 

There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement.  

The selection of proposals for the full submission for award will be based on a scientific review of proposals submitted in response to each BAA consistent with evaluation criteria identified above. Selection of proposals (full proposal) for award will be based on the potential benefits to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of funds.    The major purpose of the evaluation will be to determine the relative merit of the technical approach of each proposal. Business and contractual aspects, including proposed cost and cost realism, will also be considered as part of the evaluation. 

Funds may not be currently available for topics under this BAA. No contract award will be made for a topic until appropriated funds are available from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1) of the United States Code and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) , with the National Research Council (NRC) of Washington DC, to establish a roundtable aimed at addressing the most pressing vulnerabilities associated with critical interdependent infrastructure systems.  As a federally-established advisory board for scientific and technological matters, the NRC is the only organization in the nation with the stature to attract and gain access to the requisite range of disciplines needed to establish an effective roundtable.  The cost and time for DHS to otherwise obtain the technical expertise that the NRC can quickly assemble for the roundtable would delay the execution of tasks in critical HSARPA and S&T program areas, leaving critical national vulnerabilities unaddressed and degrading the overall mission of S&T.  Additionally, due to the nationally recognized stature and prestige of the NRC, the conclusions and findings of the roundtable will have greater acceptability and credibility among other sectors of government, industry, and the public.  The NRC also has invaluable knowledge on the topic due to their work in this area for past studies, as well as from previous discussions that have occurred between NRC and DHS personnel on this issue. 
NRC was the only source found with the required combination of scientific, technical, and programmatic expertise.  Additionally, they were the only organization capable of assembling the requisite breadth and stature of talent needed for a study of such national importance on extremely short notice.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. 
The period of performance shall be one (1) year from the date of award.  The Government anticipates the award of a fixed price contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will be issued.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB), plans to procure on a sole source basis a daVinci surgical robotic system from Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 950 Kifer Road, Sunnyvale, CA 94086.  The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 339112 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The mission of the Urologic Oncology Branch (UOB) is to develop a clinical and laboratory research program in urologic oncology for the purpose of developing better methods for diagnosis, prevention and treatment of urologic malignancies and also to provide basic and clinical research training for the development of urological surgical physician scientists.  The UOB have been leaders in pioneering minimally invasive surgery for the treatment of urologic malignancies involving the kidney and adrenal gland.  The daVinci surgical robotic system is required in order to perform minimally invasive surgeries due to cancers.  Surgeons can perform operations with no direct mechanical connections between the surgeon and patient.  In addition, this sensitive instrument allows for greater precision and visualization while using smaller incisions, again, making surgery less invasive for our patients.   The daVinci surgical robotic system by Intuitive Surgical consist of a surgeon console, patient-side cart, instruments and image processing equipment.  It is FDA approved for robotic assisted minimally invasive radical prostatectomy for the surgical resection of prostate cancer.  The surgeon operates while seated at a console viewing a three (3)-dimension image of the surgical field with ten (10) times magnification of the human eye.  Laparoscopic surgery provides vision in only two (2)-dimension and only four (4) to five (5) times magnification.  The surgeon’s fingers grasp the master controls below the display at the console.  The unique robotic system translates the surgeon’s hand, wrist and finger movements into precise, real-time movements of the surgical instruments inside the patient.  The four (4) robotic arms (three instrument arms and one endoscope arm) execute the surgeon’s commands.  A full range of instruments are provided to support the surgeon while operating, just as in open surgery.  The instruments are designed with seven degrees of motion that mimic the dexterity of the human hand and wrist.  This unique “endowrist” that the daVinci robotic system provides the surgeons allows for the execution of complex movements, such as suturing, in a minimally invasive procedure.  In addition, the robotic instrument allows the surgeons scale of motion to be reduced anywhere from 2:1 up to 5:1. This also allows a surgeon’s hand tremor to be eliminated when operating.  Pure laparoscopic instruments lack these extra degrees of rotational freedom, only having four (4) degrees of motion.  The daVinci robotic surgical system by Intuitive Surgical Inc, is the only FDA approved robotic surgical instrument known to the NCI surgeons that is FDA approve and can provide the aforementioned essential elements for the NCI surgeons.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, February 28, 2005.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number NCI- 50027-NG must be stated on all correspondence.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intends to award, under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, on a sole source basis a firm fixed priced award to Sage Technologies.  CMS requires contractor support to assist in the research of commercial off the shelf, (COTS) front-end access tools and in the development of ad hoc methodologies that utilize these tools against CMS data.  CMS requires contractor support in the analysis of the Health Care Information System Modernization (HCISMod) data models, and in the development of the front-end for other subject areas in CMS (MADS, APS, Enrollment, etc.).  The existing HCISMOD application allows its users a view of highly summarized Medicare claims data, offering predetermined views of the data.  CMS would like to increase data access for its user base and provide ad hoc querying capabilities against expanded data models, allowing the user to create his or her own view of the data.  CMS requires contractor support in the enhancements of the current MBD cube by using Cognos Powerplay product.  Some of the possible enhancements are: 1) Incorporating utilization data into the MBD cube. 2) Implementing more model for the MBD/ever-enrolled etc., 2) Assist staff in creating templates to be published concerning MBD data.  Assist CMS staff in the design of CMS enterprise data warehouse architecture.  Analyzing what is the best approach to be easy to scope with all the changes and new requirements.  The contractor shall have experience designing front-end applications with emphasis on the ability to design an application that is powerful but user-friendly for CMS staff as well as fiscal intermediaries and carriers.   This skill is critical as the CMS user community demands that development staff address usability issues across various skill levels.  Experience with the HCISMOD application design/development process is mandatory.  The same user issues/requirements shall pertain to design models for the other data marts developed at CMS.  The contractor must have experience with relational design and dimensional modeling.  The contractor shall have extensive working knowledge of the HCISMOD application and familiarity with other Medicare reporting and decision support systems (i.e. APS, Cost Reports, etc).  The contractor shall have comprehensive, detailed understanding of the data requirements that go into building the system as well as the user requirements for the front-end application that makes the data available.  The contractor shall have extensive knowledge of the NCH data utilized by other Medicare reporting and decision support systems.  The contractor shall have an in-depth understanding of the edits and transformations applied in the HCISMOD summary data programs as well as an understanding of the edits and transformations applied in other Medicare reporting and decision support systems.  This information is essential for turning the COTS products for optimal query and retrieval against CMS data.  The contractor shall have experience in modeling Medicare data.  The contractor shall have experience designing software for Medicare applications.  This experience is essential to assess maintenance and scalability issues.  The contractor must have experience with an Extract, Transform and Load, (ETL) tool in particular, Informatica PowerCenter.  The contractor should be able to use Informatica (create mappings, schedule sessions etc.) to extract data from the data sources in mainframe DB2 or Oracle in mid-tier and load them to a targeted database.  Familiarity with the CMS infrastructure is required, including the mainframe and mid-tier architecture.  Familiarity with the National Medicare Utilization Database (NMUD) data warehouse (logical and physical data models, architecture, platform, size and scope of system).  Familiarity with the Medicare Beneficiary Database, (MBD) data warehouse, and its data elements.  This knowledge will be very helpful to the enhancements for the existing MBD cube.  All developers and designers of relational data structures supporting CMS sponsored applications are required to be aware of and adhere to CMS’ Data Management standards and procedures.  The effort described in the Statement of Work shall be performed using CMS’ most current System Development Life Cycle, Data Administration and Database Administration standards, procedures, and techniques.  Refer to Data Administrations Operations Guide provided by Data Manuals Home Page on the CMS Home page (or directly at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/it/database/default.asp) for full details.  All requirements for new or modified database structures will require reviews and approvals by the Office of Information Services, Enterprise Data Group, (EDG) and Information Architecture of appointed representatives at designated milestones within the project.  Al responsible sources may submit capability statements, which shall be considered by the agency in accordance with the requirements in the synopsis.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security intends to issue a sole-source Firm Fixed Price contract to provide upgrades, training, licenses, and support for Prism eSolutions software, previously provided under another contract.  The additional licenses will allow the system software to be provided to sufficient users to allow full and effective utilization of system functionalities. The support will allow the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), Plum Island, NY to fully utilize the PRISM eSolutions software system.  PRISM eSolutions is the only company that can provide the additional licenses for their proprietary software and the upgrades and required support for a smooth transition.  No other firm can provide these services and meet the Government’s timeline for completion of the power generation facility without causing considerable delay.  Any cost savings that could be potentially gained by using a different contractor would be lost in the expense of the learning curve causing further detriment to the mission.  As the designer of PRISM eSolutions software, PRISM eSolutions, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) is considered the only responsible source and no other service will satisfy the agency’s requirements.   See note 22.

Description
This acquisition is for the privatization of the electric, steam, water and wastewater distribution systems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, DC.  Privatization is the complete divestiture and transfer of ownership of a U.S. Government-owned utility system to a non-Government entity.  In conjunction with the purchase of the systems, the contractor will also be required to provide (as needed) improvements, upgrades; repairs; expansions; investments; and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  The following guidance has established the necessary requirements to accomplish Utility Privatization (UP):  10 U.S.C. 2688 (1997) and OSD UP Guidance (09 Oct 02).  

Installation Description:

The United States Army Medical Center WRAMC is located in Washington, DC on Georgia Avenue.  WRAMC consists of the Main Section and the Forest Glen Annex. The utilities at the main section and Forest Glen (with the exception of the Historical Area) are included in this solicitation. The Main Section of WRAMC is located in a Washington residential area between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue near the Maryland-D.C. boundary. All patient care activities, as well as most WRAMC administrative services, are located on main post.

Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Forest Glen section is located in Silver Spring, Md., approximately four miles north of the main post. Forest Glen has a land area of 164 acres. It includes a contemporary area, adjacent to a mixed commercial district, and a historic district located in the wooded area that borders the Capital Beltway (I-495). The historic district is located on a 27-acre parcel of land called the National Park Seminary Historic District. The department of the Army has declared this property excess, pending transfer to the General Services Administration to find a new owner. The Historical District is no longer managed by the Army public utilities department. The contemporary area is home to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and Naval Medical Research Institute. 

Description of Facilities:  
	
A.  Electrical Distribution System:  The Walter Reed Army Medical Center electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The system may include, but is not limited to transformers, underground and overhead circuits, utility poles, switches, streetlights, and vaults.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description. 

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the electrical system.

	The installation shall retain joint use of all electrical utility poles.

The Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) electric power distribution systems, at both the Main Campus and the Forest Glen Annex use 13.2 kV underground cables from a government owned switching station.  Each local switching station is served from Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) owned 13.2 kV feeders.  Each site also has several loads already fed directly from PEPCO feeders.  A short section of 4.16 kV overhead distribution line serves a portion of the load at Forest Glen.  The cables and distributions transformers at both sites are in good condition.  The switching station at Forest Glen has recently been renovated, and the switching station at the Main Campus is in the process of being replaced.

All of the distribution transformers at Forest Glen are pad mounted outside the buildings.  At the Main Campus, most of the distribution transformers are installed in vaults or pad mounted, but some of the larger buildings, such as the main hospital building, have 13.2 kV feeders routed inside the building to serve step-down transformers.

The Main Campus of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) receives power at Building 95; the main switching station from four Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) owned 13.2 kV feeders.  All load at the WRAMC Main Campus except buildings 18 and 54 are fed from this switching station.  Three incoming feeders are designated as normal and one is designated as emergency.  Each incoming feeder is rated for 1200 Amperes or 27 Million Volt-Amperes (MVA); however the feeders appear to be relayed for 400 Amperes or 9 MVA.  The incoming feeders are connected to three buses configured in a “Ring-Bus”.  Each bus section is rated for 1200 Amperes.  Each of the three bus sections in the ring radially serves one bus with five outgoing feeders (fifteen outgoing feeders total).  There is no voltage transformation in the substation.  Each outgoing feeder is relayed for 150 Amperes (approximately 3.4 MVA), except feeders 1E, 2E, and 3E, which have 400 ampere relay settings (approximately 9 MVA, each).  These three feeders provide dedicated service to the main hospital, Building 2.  PEPCO metering is installed inside the substation.

There are approximately 5.2 miles of underground 13.2 kV distribution cable installed in duct banks on the WRAMC Main Campus.  With some exceptions, the feeders are all radial, but the duct system is configured in a double loop that allows major facilities to be served from two or three feeders via different routes from the switching station.  Manholes are installed in the duct banks at 100 to 300 foot intervals, depending on straightness of the runs and need for cable taps.  

There are approximately 59 distribution transformers on the WRAMC Main Campus which step-down the 13.2 kV distribution power to utilization voltage of 4160/2400 Volts, 480/277 Volts or 208/120 Volts.  Most of the transformers are installed in underground vaults outside the buildings.  However, some of the larger buildings have transformers installed in their electrical rooms feeding directly into low voltage switchboards and panelboards.

The project to replace the Main Campus switching station involves the construction of three (3) multi-section electrical switching station units to be housed in a partially underground storage area.  Each switching station unit will consist of one (1) normal incoming feeder, one (1) alternate incoming feeder with a tie vacuum breaker, five (5) outgoing feeders, and a spare breaker. Once the new switching stations are operational the existing switching facility will be decommissioned and demolished. All existing downstream transformers will be provided with fused dual primary selective switches, which will limit the available fault current at each transformer.

The WRAMC Forest Glen Annex (Forest Glen) receives power at Building 192, the main switching station, from one PEPCO owned 13.2 kV feeder.  A second PEPCO feeder was installed to the recently completed switching station to support the load addition from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Facility.  There are three outgoing feeders from the switching station, each of which is rated for approximately 5.5 MVA.  Most buildings at Forest Glen, with the following exceptions, are fed from this switching station.  The buildings near the ball fields are fed from a 4160 Volt overhead distribution line from a step down station in the historic area.  The “500" series buildings accessed from Brookville Road are fed from an underground feeder served from a PEPCO metering pole at Brookville Road.  Buildings 516 and 513 are served from a PEPCO owned pole-mounted transformer behind building 516.  Building 513 is served from building 516.  Building 173 is served directly from PEPCO, with a PEPCO meter on the outside back wall of the building.

There are approximately 1.3 miles of Government owned 13.2 kV distribution cables at Forest Glen, installed in duct banks.  There is some uncertainty about the exact length of 13.2 kV cables at Forest Glen serving the WRAIR Facility.  Manholes are installed in the duct banks at 200 to 300 foot intervals, depending on straightness of the runs and need for cable taps. There is also an 800 foot long government owned 4.16 kV distribution line, mentioned above, on the Forest Glen Annex.  This line is connected to the 4.16 kV substation, building 180, through a government owned feeder in the historic area, which is not part of this contract.

Approximately 17 government owned transformers at Forest Glen step-down the 13.2 kV or 4.16 kV distribution power to utilization voltage of 480/277 Volts or 208/120 Volts.  Additional transformers have been installed to serve the WRAIR Facility. 
  
B.  Steam Distribution System:  The WRAMC steam distribution system comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the Boiler house to the points of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The systems may include, but are not limited to distribution piping and appurtenances.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution systems.  The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the bidder’s library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description.  

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the steam and boiler systems.

The main campus steam distribution system consists of three major components, the boilers and boiler house, the main steam campus distribution system located with the utility tunnels and the direct bury steam distribution piping from the campus distribution system in the tunnels to within 5 feet of the end user’s building.   The following is a detailed description of each system based on existing drawings, interviews and recently completed reports.  

The steam generation plant at WRAMC is a centralized steam generating facility which provides steam throughout the campus for heating and other base specific needs.  The Steam system is comprised of four dual fuel (natural gas primary, with #2 fuel oil backup) boilers which supply the facility with 110 pounds per square inch (psi) steam.  

The facility has been upgraded throughout the years and some of the most significant improvements include, replacement of the condensate return tank in 1982, installation of new fuel oil tanks in 1994, replacing the portions of the controls, wiring and valves in 2002.   The boiler support equipment consists of typical steam plant components such as, condensate receiver, deaerating feed tank, condensate pump (Electric – 2, Steam -1)  boiler feed water pumps (Steam – 2, Electric -2), fuel oil transfer pumps, economizers for boilers 1 and 2, and make up water chemical treatment to identify some of the major equipment.  The boilers and boiler house are maintained and operated by The Department of Public Works (DPW).

The steam distribution system at WRAMC consists of the main steam supply lines located in tunnels.  The tunnels are identified as the West and North Tunnels and are approximately 4,700 linear feet containing steam, condensate, high pressure drip and other utility services.  The existing north tunnel was built around the beginning of the 20th century and the newer west tunnel constructed in the mid 80’s.  The piping within the tunnels ranging in diameter from ¾ inch for high pressure drip traps to 18 inches for high pressure steam distribution mains. 

The buildings are supplied from the mains located within the tunnels via direct bury piping to the buildings.  The underground piping consists of approximately 4,500 linear feet of direct buried piping of various sizes supplying steam and returning condensate.  In some cases the piping is routed through buildings rather then using a utility tunnel or direct bury piping for ease of access.  The evaluation of the steam system ends approximately 5 feet from the building.  The steam distribution system is maintained and operated by The Department of Public Works (DPW).

C.  Water Distribution System:  The WRAMC water distribution system comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the point at which the water enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation or the real estate easements that result from negotiations under this contract.  The systems may include, but are not limited to distribution piping and appurtenances.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution systems.  The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the bidder’s library, and other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree on the following description.  

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water system.

The water distribution system at WRAMC Main Post consists of approximately 22,260 LF of distribution piping ranging in diameter from ¾ inch to 8 inches.  The original water distribution system was installed in the 1900’s, but piecemeal replacements and additions have occurred as needed over succeeding years.  The water distribution system at Forest Glen consists of approximately 10,884 LF of piping.  WRAMC is a customer of the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) as well as the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Average monthly consumption will be provided in the Solicitation.  Plans of the systems will be available as part of the Technical Library.

D.  Wastewater and Stormwater Collection System:  The WRAMC wastewater collection system comprises all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the point in which the Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation to be defined by the Solicitation.  The system may include, but is not limited to the collection piping and appurtenances.  In addition, this section describes the stormwater collection system of WRAMC, which will be transferred with the wastewater collection system, although the two systems are not interconnected.  The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the collection systems.  

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the wastewater and stormwater systems.

The wastewater and stormwater collection systems at the main post and the Forest Glen Annex consist of collection piping and appurtenances.  The original wastewater collection system was constructed in the 1920’s, and improvements have been made as needed since that time.  It is unknown when the current stormwater system was installed.  All domestic wastewater generated at WRAMC main post is discharged to the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) and Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission at Forest Glen.  Average annual flow to the City is unknown. Billing is based upon the water consumption.   Stormwater is discharged to the Rock Creek at Rock Creek Park, then directly to the Potomac River south of the center without treatment. The stormwater piping at Forest Glen is piped to detention ponds and eventually to Rock Creek and the Potomac.

The wastewater/stormwater collection systems at WRAMC main post consist of approximately 16,250 feet of gravity sewers and an unknown amount of storm sewers.  The Forest Glen Section consists of approximately 9,468 feet of gravity sewers and an unknown amount of storm sewers.  There are 128 wastewater manholes at Main Post and 55 wastewater manholes at Forest Glen Annex.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RDECOM-ARDEC’s involvement in the Army’s Future Combat System (FCS) Munitions Systems, and the next generation of advanced armament systems will require smart, miniature and complex fuzing systems which need to be integrated with multi-mode warheads, seekers, sensors and guidance systems. To support this involvement, RDECOM-ARDEC requires the services of a contractor having extensive experience and background in the design, fabrication and testing of small dense packaging of complex mechanical, electro-mechanical and electronic systems subject to extreme environments (i.e., simultaneous high “G”, high pressure, and high temperature environments resulting from tank cannon gun launch) with a high flight functioning reliability. The contractor is also required to have broad and extensive experience in the area of mechanical and electronic fuze items/devices related to Safe and Arm (S&A), Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS),Application  Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), Global Positioning (GPS) System Receivers, and “gun-hardened” components/devices (as related to cannon fired munitions, allowing these munitions to match the system’s required capability).  This capability must be under the contractor’s direct control or contractor must have an established agreement with a teaming member. RDECOM-ARDEC’s Line of Sight/Beyond Line of Sight (LOS/BLOS) Munitions Branch  has ongoing programs for the development of munition concepts to advance the performance capabilities as well as the producibility of items related to various gun launched munitions.  This program is to emphasize the exploration of and exploitation of the many mechanical, electronics, electrical, electromechanical and Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, technologies (both proven and promising) as they would apply to gun launched munitions.  This contract effort will provide flexibility for RDECOM-ARDEC to leverage industry capabilities on many design, engineering, prototype manufacturing and manufacturing technology efforts.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) has contractual support requirements for Information Technology (IT) Management, Operations, and Maintenance for the Command Information Management System (CIMS).  The CIMS is the overall comman d enterprise (global) and support architecture comprising the primary functional IT support required to support the commands mission areas that support the sustaining operations.   These functional IT support areas include primarily Contract Management, E ngineering and Development Operations, Help Desk Operations, Computer Operations, Database Management and Operations, Applications Development, Network Operations, Information Assurance Operations, Web Development Operations, Visual Information Operations,  Communications Operations and Command Support and Operations. These efforts will require a professionally skilled, well trained, and retainable workforce to support the USASMDC Major Command (MACOM).  The major components of the CIMS architecture include the following:  1) the unclassified USASMDC enterprise network; 2) the CIMS Oracle database management system; 3) the USASMDC classified networks; 4) the CIMS-Library systems; 5) the Special Purpose Automated systems; 6) the command standard personal compu ters, and 7) the CIMS helpdesk providing day-to-day assistance to CIMS users of Automated Information System (AIS) equipment and services provided by CIMS.   The CIMS contract also supports technical directives and technical enhancements (which will be issued via task orders) that are not a part of the USASMDC standard level of support.  Technical directives are used by individual organizations requiring specia l assistance in the Information Technology area.  Technical enhancements are also used by individual organizations requiring enhancements to their technical base up and above the standard level of support.  The contractor must have extensive, in-depth and current experience with the CIMS in order for USASMDC to maintain current level of support to the architecture in support of its missions.   The contractor shall actively pursue and maintain a quality business support system in support of CIMS operations and missions.  An intense project management system should exist to oversee, direct, and coordinate all contract support activities to include , but not limited to, an intense IT engineering program for upgrades and performance improvement programs for the CIMS.  This shall include designing, developing, re-engineering, and integrating state-of-the-art software and hardware enhancements in the CI MS architecture.  These efforts are required to provide an innovative, high quality, cost effective, state-of-the-art, sustaining base IT environment that supports USASMDC missions and functions that include aggressive USASMDC Research and Development (R&D ) projects/programs.  The USASMDC R&D projects/programs develop and test leading edge technologies in support of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and other Department of Defense (DOD) programs. USASMDCs current organizational structure consists of the following locations: 1) SMDC  Arlington, Virginia - Headquarters (HQ); 2) SMDC - Huntsville - Huntsville, Alabama; 3) SMDC - Colorado Springs  Peterson AFB, Colorado;, 4) SMDC - High Energy Laser  Test Facility (HELSTF)  White Sands, New Mexico; 5) Kwajalein/Reagan Test Site (USAKA/RTS)  Marshall Islands; and 6) Force Development Integration Center (FDIC)  Arlington, VA. This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  All USASMDC contractors shall be U.S. citizens and hold United States government security clearances and possess local designated access approvals per  the direction of USASMDC Security and Information Assurance.  Security clearances shall be commensurate with the level of information processed on the system(s) or network(s).  Personnel shall be qualified to perform duties as specified in A rmy Regulation 25-2 and other contract designated positions and tasks. The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type with a basic ordering period of three years with seven one year award terms.  The acquisition is 100% set aside for small business competition.  Small Businesses should note th e FAR 19 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code of 541512 with a size standard of $21 million.  Small businesses may team together and be eligible for award of a set-aside contract, providing that each team member meets the NAICS code s mall business definition that for procurement.  The rules allow a set aside when there is an expectation of two or more competitive offers from small businesses or small business teams when at least 50% of the services will be performed by the small busine ss or the collective efforts of all small business members of the team.  Further, the current affiliation rules allow 8(a) joint ventures or teams when each team member is small according to the applicable NAICS code and the 8(a) concern performs a signif icant amount of the work with its own employees.  Such teams and/or joint ventures require the prior approval of the U.S. Small Business Administration.

<DESC>THIS IS A SORCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVALIABLE.  For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of Work will be available online at http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/.  The s olicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-05-R-0005.  VCCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at either one or both of the following projects (separate contracts will be awarded for each project): 1.  Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in the St ate of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both projects are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work is ava ilable online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Million per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.  The NAICS Code for both proposed acquisitions is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $30 Mil. Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  The Government will use responses to th is SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection process t hat will result in award of a cost-plus-award-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government anti cipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements consist ing of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or a maj or subcontractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope and complexity.  Each reference shall include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the services provided, contract ty pe (i.e., fixed price or cost), and dollar value.  Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.  Respondents must indicate in their cover letter the project for which they are submitting (MS LAKES OR ARK LAKES), and if for both, only one submittal is required. The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Stateme nt of Work.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will as sist the VCCO in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.

C - Architect and Engineering Services
--------------------------------------------------------------
The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 9-story Courthouse, located at 5th and Walnut Street, in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1939. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Goverequired supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  

For each reference project, provide a contact including name, title, address, phone and fax numbers.  

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the SF 330 must be reflected in a subcontracting plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan should be submitted with the SF330 in Stage II. The small business size standard for this procurement under NAICS code 541310 is $4,000,000 based on average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years. Contact your local SBA office for further information. Firms seeking consideration for this contact shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible. An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.

<DESC>Stage One has been completed and the following firms have been invited to participate in Stage Two.

Quinn Evans Architects: Ann Arbor, MI
Goody Clancy: Boston, MA
Hillier Architecture: Philadelphia, PA

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture with the modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse. Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project. The 9-story Courthouse, located at 5th and Walnut Street, in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, was completed in 1939. The estimated total construction cost for the project is approximately $30,000,000 to $40,000,000.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work. A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project concept and design documents. The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept.

The project scope of work consists of the cleaning and repair of exterior walls, replacement and/or restoration of the historic façade and light court windows, and the replacement of the roof over the 9th floor. The project will require the removal of the cooling towers, chillers and associated pumps, and tanks as well as the replacement of the boilers. An emergency generator will be installed with this project and the existing sprinkler system will be extended throughout the remaining unsprinkled areas of the building. The defunct air handling unit (AHU) and associated ductwork in the basement will be removed. Included with the project is the abatement of any asbestos found during the demolition of the boilers, cooling towers, chillers and pumps. The project includes the renovation of two freight elevators, the replacement of generators and the modernization of the motors on 8 passenger and one freight elevators. The lighting levels in two level 8 courtrooms will be improved along with the addition of a new courtroom on the 1st floor and new chambers on the 2nd floor. A satellite Office for the U.S. Attorney and a Grand Jury Suite will be added as well as lobby and corridor renovations. Repairs to the exterior include the structural steel at the east ramp area, the exterior areaway, stair landings and sidewalks. Interior vestibule doors will be replaced to match the original historical doors. A new AHU will be added to the 1st floor courtroom with the addition of Direct Digital Controls (DDC) to the AHU in the Marshal’s spaces. Increased security will require the addition of motion sensors and security card access devices to the judges’ chamber doors. The restrooms will be brought up to Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS). Tenant and common area signage will be upgraded with Braille. This work will all take place during evening hours and will require precise phasing so as not to disrupt the daily workings of the Courts. Also as part of the HVAC improvements, efforts will be undertaken to make this building LEED certified for sustainability, accessibility, and energy efficiency. 

The design A/E selected under this solicitation will design the planned modernization and renovation as described including at a minimum: site and system verification, analysis of previous investigative reports, tenant programming and space design, design concepts, design development, construction documentation, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering, partnering and Post Construction Contract Services (PCCS).  The scope may include: presentation to the national historic officials for approval; coordination of previous analysis and work performed at the Potter Stewart Courthouse; review, documentation, and discussion with the CMc team to ensure a smooth and complete transition of the desired design direction; and other rnment.  This project will be designed following GSA’s “Facility Standards for the Public Building Service”, the U.S. Courts Design Guide, the U. S. Marshal’s “Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manuals”, as well as any other affected tenant-agency’s security requirements.  This project will be designed to meet GSA energy goals and include sustainable design and construction practices using the LEED system as a guide.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

STAGE I:    The first stage will establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and their Lead Designer. From the first stage, a minimum of three (3) A/E Design Firms will be selected for continuation into the stage two interviews. The short list will be based on the A/E Design Firm’s submittal in response to this Request for Qualifications.  The A/E Design Firm will provide specific evidence of its capabilities to deliver Design Excellence within a historic structure and will express its design approach and philosophy. In Stage 1, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8-1/2 x 11 inch format. The portfolio should include the following:  1. A cover letter referencing this FBO announcement and a brief description of the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; 2. The Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) modified to include only the information requested in this RFQ for Stage I. Identification of consultants is not required at this stage. Qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria:

(1)      PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%):    The A/E Design Firm shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of projects completed within the past ten years.    Submit NO MORE THAN five (5) relevant projects. The firms responding shall clearly demonstrate competence in exterior building repairs, HVAC renovation, fire alarm replacement, and development of phasing plans for occupied facilities, and sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how the historic preservation and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.    

(2)      LEAD DESIGNER’S PORTFOLIO (25%):    The Lead Designer shall submit 8 X 10 inch graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a written description (maximum of one page per project) of three (3) relevant projects each completed within the last ten years directly attributable to the Lead Designer. Narrative shall include a discussion of design challenges and solutions and be a good indicator of how well the Lead Designer worked with a sensitive and important client. The sample relevant projects shall clearly demonstrate sensitive design treatment of mid-20th century heritage buildings. The narrative shall address the design approach and salient features for each project (including evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, and peer recognition) and discuss how historic preservation (if any) and design constraints were satisfied by the design solution.

(3)      PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%):    In the Lead Designer’s words (maximum of two written pages), state his/her overall design philosophy, approach to the challenge of resolving historic preservation issues, and parameters that may apply specifically to the renovation and repair of mid-20th century heritage buildings. Also, discuss how design and the coordination of complex multiphase construction in occupied office space may affect their approach and design process. Include a discussion on how they would approach renovation work in sensitive, symbolic and secured spaces as found in the Federal agency spaces and judicial courtrooms and chambers.

(4)      LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%):    Submit a biographical sketch including education, professional experience and recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples. Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.  

For each reference project, provide a contact including name, title, address, phone and fax numbers.  

STAGE II:    For Stage II, the short listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. In this stage, the entire project team will be evaluated. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect – Engineer Qualifications (Part I and Part II) including consultant information. An interview with each project team will be included in this stage.  During the interviews, A/E firms should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the evaluation criteria and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, professional qualifications, and team organization and management plan. The Government will establish the detailed stage II evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due. A brief period, approximately three weeks, will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team. In developing the Stage II team, A/E firms are advised that they will be evaluated on whether at least 35% of the design effort will be within the designated geographical area of the State of Ohio.  Any arrangement toward this goal must be in place prior to the submittal of Stage II information.

This procurement is open to all business concerns. In accordance with 15 USC 631 et seq., the selected A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-owned, small disadvantaged, and service disabled veteran owned businesses. The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the SF 330 must be reflected in a subcontracting plan which will be included in the contract. The detailed plan should be submitted with the SF330 in Stage II. The small business size standard for this procurement under NAICS code 541310 is $4,000,000 based on average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) years.

Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in the St ate of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both projects are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work is ava ilable online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Million per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.  The NAICS Code for both proposed acquisitions is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $30 Mil. Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.

Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.  Respondents must indicate in their cover letter the project for which they are submitting (MS LAKES OR ARK LAKES), and if for both, only one submittal is required.

Responses may include component or system level concepts including transmitters, receivers, software defined radios, error correction code processors, telemetry processors, ground station antenna feeds, RF/IF down converters and other RF components and systems employed in ground station receive and transmit signal chains.  The project is interested in learning of individual component technologies as well as complete system concepts.  Responses to this RFI should focus on ground segment technologies and concepts, not spacecraft flight systems.   Cost and schedule are discriminators in LRO’s eventual selection of any solution, and so the project is mostly interested with responses that closely match or exceed LRO’s assumed requirements, however, the project is interested in learning of potential technology developments that could benefit LRO, RLEP and the Agency.   In addition to the general topics discussed above, the LRO mission requests the following.  Interested parties do not have to respond to the following questions if they do not apply to their proposed component / technology / system. 1.	Discuss an approach to employ SN/TDRSS-like CDMA signaling for communication and tracking in a ground station context to support lunar TT&C functions at S-band.  Responses should specifically address PN code ranging techniques (TDRSS Data Group 1, Mode 1).  This may include COTS and custom systems, technologies and developments.  Discuss the proposed concept, its implementation, the tracking accuracy achievable, and provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as estimated schedule ARO. 2.	Discuss an approach to retrofit existing ground station antennas to support high rate Ka-band telemetry receive and capture capable of supporting LRO’s requirements.  Discussion may assume installation of complete receive systems (with the exception of the antenna itself) or may discuss individual components that could be used to synthesize a complete design.  This may include COTS and custom systems, technologies and developments.  Discuss the proposed concept, and provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as estimated schedule ARO. 3.	Discuss technologies, components and systems available to support LRO’s S-band TT&C requirements assuming standard STDN/DSN signal formats.  This may include COTS and custom systems, technologies and developments.	Discuss the proposed concept, and provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as estimated schedule ARO. 4.	Discuss an approach to implement CCSDS CFDP file delivery from LRO to ground stations.  The emphasis should be on the ground segment implementation and should not place requirements on the spacecraft other than compliance with CCSDS CFDP implementation standards.  This may include COTS and custom systems, technologies and developments.  Discuss the proposed concept, and provide ROM estimates for NRE and procurement costs as well as estimated schedule ARO. Information submitted to GSFC in response to this RFI will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information.  Information submitted in response to this Request for Information will be used for LRO and RLEP concept development activities.  Parties proposing concepts of interest to LRO and RLEP may be invited to submit more detailed information or to discuss their concepts further. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	 No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking a conservator to restore an original plaster model of the sculpture “Sentinels of Safety”.  In 1925, President Herbert Hoover announced the The Sentinels of Safety awards to promote an increased commitment to mine safety and to the continuing development of effective accident prevention programs.  This is the oldest established awards for occupational safety in the United States.  All active and intermittently active mineral mining operations that are required to report injury and employment data under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 are eligible to participate in the program.  Eight separate groups, consisting of mining operations having similar characteristics, are identified for the program.  A bonze trophy is awarded to the winners of the award in each of the eight categories.  These mining operations retain custody of the award for one year, when it is transferred to the following year’s winning operation.   The Mine Safety and Health Administration has the original plaster model used to cast the “Sentinels of Safety” trophy.  This plaster model is approximately two feet in height and has suffered considerable damage over the years and is in need of conservation/restoration.   Conservation work required on the plaster model includes; removal of dust, dirt, and grime from all surfaces using appropriate conservation quality cleaning agents;  removal of stains, including tape residue, red marker, and other stained areas; securing the statues structure and any unstable or loose plaster fragments or detached glazing, Restoration work may include a “first level” restoration consisting of the cosmetic treatment of the sculpture to fill and restore the surface area to original condition. Interested parties are to provide their qualifications, experience and membership in any relevant associations by COB Tuesday, February 22, 2005.  Responses may be forwarded by email to Robert N Beaty, Contracting Officer, at beaty.robert@dol.gov  or by fax at 202-693-9826.  This notice is for information purposes only and is not a solicitation.  However, if MSHA elects to issue a solicitation for these services, the distribution of any such solicitation shall be limited to those parties responding to this sources sought notice as well as those sources already known to the contracting officer.

<DESC>This is a request for information for a commercial item in accordance with the FAR 12.6 and 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling urgency.  No proposals are requested by this announcement all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials.  
The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this request for information.

Objective:  The United States Department of Commerce seeks to acquire more information related to products that would be used as respiratory protection during a chemical or biological agent exposure.  Specifically, there exists an interest in Escape Respiratory Protection that would be used for personnel that will be acting as floor monitors in order to assist employees from the building during an evacuation.  Monitors must be able to communicate with both the employees they are directing and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  The second group would be children from the DOC Child Care Center.  Children do not need to communicate, however the respiratory protection product must be able to accommodate infants through pre-schoolers.  As a baseline, the contemplated product must allow greater levels of protection that are equal to or better than NIOSH or SBCCOM certification (if one exists).  EOC Respiratory Protection for personnel who provide command and control though-out the facility for extended periods (up to full shift usage) during a chemical or biological agent exposure.  These individuals use telephones and radios to communicate so any respiratory protection equipment provided must have a minimal impact on communication.  This equipment must accommodate one size fits all and not require a fit test, or a medical evaluation for use.  As a baseline, the respiratory protection equipment must provide levels of protection that are equal to or better than NIOSH or SBCCOM certification.  


Technical/Functional Requirements: Provided below are some of the salient features of the respiratory protection product for floor monitors:

Not interfere with the ability to wear eyeglasses and does not require the wearer to be clean-shaven or interfere with oral communication.  Escape protection must be readily adaptable to children.  Provide protection against common organic compounds and particles that could result from a Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear (CBRN), fire or natural event.  Products for both groups must provide short duration protection for building escape or evacuation.  Have NIOSH, SBCCOM, or equivalent certification or approval.  Have training units available.

Emergency Operations Center respiratory protection will:
Have minor impact on communication, allowing wearer to use telephones and radios.
Provide protection against common organic compounds and particles that could result from a CBRN, fire, or natural event.
Provide extended use, i.e. up to full shift usage.
Have the fewest requirements for use, i.e., fit testing, medical evaluation, and one size fits all is preferred.

<DESC>THIS IS A SORCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVALIABLE.  For information purposes, the DRAFT Statement of Work will be available online at http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/.  The s olicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-05-R-0005.  VCCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation for operation, maintenance, and repair of flood control facilities managed by the Corps of Engineers at either one or both of the following projects (separate contracts will be awarded for each project): 1.  Arkabutla, Sardis, Enid, and Grenada Lakes in the St ate of Mississippi (MS LAKES) and/or 2. Ouachita, Greeson, and Degray Lakes in the State of Arkansas (ARK LAKES).  Both projects are nearly identical in the type, complexity, and variety of work required.  Only the MS LAKES project Statement of Work is ava ilable online at this time.  The main difference between the two projects is the amount of work required.  The MS LAKES project has historically averaged between $5 and $6 Million per year, while the ARK LAKES project averages between $1.5 to $2.5 Million per year.  Unless otherwise noted, all descriptions below refer to either of the projects.  The NAICS Code for both proposed acquisitions is 561210, Facilities (except computer operation) support services, and the small business size standard is $30 Mil. Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, repair/alteration/all other.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  The Government will use responses to th is SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Best Value source selection process t hat will result in award of a cost-plus-award-fee contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and cost considered.  The Government anti cipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Statement of Work to submit Capability Statements consist ing of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or a maj or subcontractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope and complexity.  Each reference shall include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, contract numbers as well as a description of the services provided, contract ty pe (i.e., fixed price or cost), and dollar value.  Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.  Respondents must indicate in their cover letter the project for which they are submitting (MS LAKES OR ARK LAKES), and if for both, only one submittal is required. The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Stateme nt of Work.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will as sist the VCCO in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for inf ormation and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, or 8(a) firms or proceed with competition among all small business firms.  Submissions that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not.

<SUBJECT>A -- Industry Based Survey
<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Administrative Support Center (EASC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a modification to contract EA133F-03-CN-0011 with the State of Massachusetts, Division of Marine Resources, to increase research services for Atlantic Cod distribution.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts currently provides these services to the National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Regional Office, Cooperative Research Partners Initiative, Gloucester, Massachusetts.    The program objective is to define a broad scale distribution of cod aggregations in the Gulf of Maine, in a temporal and spatial scale sufficient for management purposes, by age and size composition.  Information on cod population age structure, growth rates, spawning sizes and seasonality, and associations with other species and habitat are collected through this program.   The Massachusetts DMF is uniquely qualified to perform because they have the unique survey trawls specifically designed to catch a full range of cod year classes, while targeting the larger spawning size fish. This allows fishing over all substrate types that are encountered during the survey (e.g., soft mud to hard rocky ledge).   The DMF possesses the equipment and scientific personnel with extensive experience related to this survey design and methodology to ensure the survey continues unabated.  The proposed increase in scope is anticipated to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT).   The statutory authority for this action is 41 USC 253( c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.

5.	Work as a medical officer, through telephone meetings, and assist in the medical device review process by providing clinical consults on the Investigational Device Exemption and Pre-market Approval Applications that are received in the Office because he/she shall be familiar with the design of the devices and his/her expertise will be used in rendering decisions.
6.	Provide written formal consultative memoranda with the time constraints dictated by regulations. 
7.	Be available for telephone communication and verbal consultations with the staff of DAGID on an ad hoc basis.  
8.	Be committed to a regularly scheduled weekly telephone interaction with DAGID staff and participate telephonically at meetings and conferences as is necessary.  
9.	Participate at professional meetings as a representative of the FDA.  
10.	Have working knowledge of Agency regulations, procedures, and policy.  

An award will be made in ten (10) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, which fully demonstrate their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency. This sole source procurement is being awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>Solicitation AG-52KY-S-05-0002 is hereby amended to include the following:

Award will be made based on a best value analysis to include price, past performance, and quality.  Offerors should include past performance information along with their offer.  In addition, please include a short paragraph stating your approach to quality control.  




QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING SOLICITATION

1. Maple Syrup process developed at University of Minnesota and an older version is available from Minnesota. Other processes may work.

2. http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov/mlra11/manuscript_publications/Manuscripts.html this web site contains examples of Historical Indiana soil survey maps similar to the counties in the contract.

3. Mylar soil survey maps are about 24" X 14".

4. Rule of thumb tolerance is one soil line width error

5. Quality assurance is a photo image to image comparison with soil line placement.

6. Is it possible to receive a sample dataset or a sample soil map that is reflective of the soil maps to be rectified for these soil surveys?  Perhaps there is a current file on-line?

Yes. See question 2.


7.  Regarding the section "Work to be performed":  Is the use of the MAPLE SYRUP software a requirement for the winning contractor(s) or is an equivalent software package acceptable?  

Equivalent package may work OK.

8. How much ground area is covered in each map sheet? How much area in insets?  
Don't know. Total acres per county: Fayette: 137,653 Union: 105,755 Putnam: 308,625 Madison: 289,704 Morgan: 261,819

9. Would you provide a scanned sample of atlas sheets and soil overlay, so we can get a better idea what type of data will be supplied from your office.  
This was answered in other questions. They are half tome film positives at 1:12,000 scale of the original soil survey report atlas sheets. One copy is with photo image, the other without. 

10.  Is the MAPLE SYRUP a standard process required for this project? Will you supply the MAPLE SYRUP software for orthorectification?  
Other software may work. See other comments. 

11. Soil Overlay, Culture & Drainage overlay, are they in hardcopy or digital format?  
Half tome film positive mylars. 

12.  Does this compilation includes scanning all hard copy atlas sheets and rectify all of them (photobase, composite overlay, special feature, and soils overlay) or just Soil Survey map?  
All the sheets must be scanned and orthorectified. Labeled soil polygons digital file for the entire county should be delivered.   

13 Dem files: are they raster format or ASCII list? What is the grid spacing? Are they pieces of overlapped data or single piece Dem for each county?  
DEM files should be 10M raster format, individual tiles. 

14 Digital DOQQs: are they black/white or color geo-referenced TIFF image?  
black and white 

15. Final Data in ArcInfo Coverage, which version of the ArcInfo? Vector lines or polygons? 2D lines or 3D lines?  
ArcGIS 9 preferred. Polygons for soils, point and line files for special features. 
 
16.	As for ¡°Photo base separate¡±, I am assuming this
is non-rectified air photo, when was the photo taken? 
Can we find the focus length on the photo or some
record? Does the photo have the fiducial points on? We
plan to use ERDAS imagine or OrthoMapper
(http://www.surfacemapper.com/) to do this work and
those information are necessary.  we realized that you
suggest using MAPLE SYRUP software to do this work,
but the tool is not commercial software, we don¡¯t
know how to get it. If you require to use this tool to
finish the work, can we rent a copy from your office?

There should be 2 sets of 1:12,000 half tone film positives (mylar) for the survey areas. These are copies of the original soil survey map sheets. One set has photo background the other does not. We have no information regarding the original photos although this could perhaps be researched and ascertained. The SYRUP method was mentioned but other methods could perhaps be used. MAPLE SYRUP was developed at the University of Minnesota and the software is available but is only compatible with older versions of ERDAS imagine unless it is modified. We do not have the software.   

17.	What is Quarter Quadrangles? Is it soil survey map
based on DOQs? If so, we can clip the soil survey quad
from county coverage?

It depends. Some may work from the quarter quad base and mosaic a county coverage, others may do a county coverage and clip to quads.

18.	What is Soil Overlay, type positive? It is mylar
with the soil boundary lines? If so, there is nothing
on ¡°Photo base separate¡±?

See response to #16.

Statement of Work for the Gypsy Moth (+) Disparlure String Dispenser 

Background

Gypsy moth pheromone dispensers are used in traps to detect infestation outside of generally infested areas. Once an infestation has been detected, a grid of traps (from 16 to 49 traps per square mile) is used to delimit the area of infestation. Although the number of the traps used in detection survey can be fairly well predicted from year-to-year, the use for delimiting will vary.

Pheromone dispensers are also used for mass trapping as a control measure. This technique uses nine traps per acre, usage rates for this purpose varies. In addition pheromone dispensers are used to monitor populations in and along the edge of the generally infested area.

Specifications — Standard Life (+) Disparlure PVC String Dispensers

The PVC string dispensers are constructed of twisted nylon twine, coated with a mixture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and (+) disparlure (0.6 % by weight).

Dispensers provided under this contract are subject to first article approval — Government testing using laboratory and field bioassays before effecting delivery. The dispensers shall fully satisfy specifications; and specifically, the following criteria in USDA conducted aging tests.

Standard life dispensers shall provide an initial release rate of 100-200 ng/hr and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of aging in a greenhouse (average temperature of 32 degrees centigrade), they will have a release rate of> 30 ng/hr. The method describe by Leonhardt et al 1990 shall be used to measure release rates in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 35 degrees centigrade. The average residual (+) disparlure content of dispensers shall be at least 100 ug of (+) disparlure after 12 weeks of greenhouse aging. Data for emission rates and residual contents shall be developed on at least 10 replicate dispensers produced using the same process and equipment the manufacturer intend to use for the production run.

Standard life PVC string design dispensers shall be constructed of multi-stranded nylon twine (1.5 mm diam X 14 to 16 cm long) coated with a mixture of PVC (+) disparlure (6.9 ul or (+) disparlure per gram of liquid PVC by weight). The total loading (+) disparlure concentration on the coated twine will be approximately 33 ug/cm of string length. Pages will contain the date of manufacture. Construction should be such that previously describe release rate and residual content specification are met

<DESC>Questions and Answers:
Question #1: Is it truly a requirement to have RvA accreditation in addition to ANAB (formerly ANSI-RAB) accreditation?
Answer #1: NADEP JAX seeks both RvA and ANAB for business purposes.  As mentioned in the PSOW paragraph 1.2.4, the Depot’s customers include the following countries:
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Republic of Kuwait, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, NATO, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States of America.

Question #2: Does a registrar (certification body) having ANAB Accreditation to provide ISO 9001:2000 and AS9100-2001 certification / registration, satisfy the accreditation requirements cited in the mentioned solicitation? Or will not having RvA accreditation (for ISO 9001:2000) impact a registrar's technical rating assigned to its proposal?
Answer #2:  NADEP JAX seeks certification/registration under ANSI-RAB accreditation for AS9100-2001 and certification/registration under RvA accreditation for ISO9001:2000 for business purposes.  Therefore, both RvA and ANSI-RAB Accreditations are required for a pass rating for this technical subfactor. 

Question #3:  With regards to corporate or individual-site certificates,  the solicitation seems to infer that it will be a single certificate (NADEPJAX) with the detachment facilities coming under this certificate? Is this correct?
Answer #3:  Yes, a Corporate certificate is sought for the Depot and detachment facilities. (Depot-Wide)

Question #4:  Will Section 7.3 of the Statement of Work (Design responsibility) be excluded from this requirement(that NADEPJAX does not do parts design)?
Answer #4:  7.3 is included.  It applies to NADEPJAX’s organizational functions that deliver design services to their external customers.  

Question #5: What are the Employee levels at each facility?
Answer #5:  Please see Tables 1 and 3 of the PSOW. 

Question #6: In the case of a Corporate certificate, not all detachment facilities would normally be audited semi-annually. Is the intent for all detachment facilities to be audited semi-annually also?
Answer #6:  All detachment facilities are to be audited ANNUALLY consistent with the Corporate certification standards. The Depot is to be audited on a SEMI-ANNUAL basis.
