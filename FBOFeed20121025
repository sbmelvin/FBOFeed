In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<DESC><p>As required by section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS must re-compete its Part A &amp; B Medicare Administrative Contractor (A/B MAC) contracts every five (5) years. The purpose of this contract is to obtain an A/B MAC (hereinafter, referred to as "the Contractor") to provide specified health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, in support of the Medicare FFS program. The Contractor shall perform its responsibilities under the direction of CMS.</p>
<p>The Contractor will perform numerous functions to support health care services for Medicare beneficiaries, which include performing claims-related activities and establishing relationships with providers of health care services, both institutional and professional, for a defined geographic area or "jurisdiction." The Contractor will perform the requirements of this contract in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, Medicare manuals, as well as CMS requirements to ensure the financial integrity of the Medicare program. The Medicare program has complex legal, policy, and operating environments. The Contractor will utilize and interact with all pertinent CMS-required payment schedules, systems, equipment, and operational capabilities in the performance of its functions. Further, the Contractor will not only coordinate its activities with CMS, but must also work with a broad range of Federal, State, and Local government agencies, CMS partners and Contractors, and any other stakeholder in the health care system of the United States.</p>
<p>In accordance with CMS' technical specifications, the Contractor shall receive and control Medicare claims from institutional and professional providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries within its jurisdiction, and will perform all standard or otherwise required editing with respect to these claims to determine whether they are complete and ready for payment. An edit is defined as "logic within the Standard Claims Processing System (or PSC/ZPIC Supplemental Edit Software) that selects certain claims, evaluates or compares information on the selected claims or other accessible source, and, depending on the evaluation, takes action on the claims, such as pay in full, pay in part, or suspend for manual review."</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor will calculate Medicare payment amounts and remit those payments to the appropriate party. The Contractor also will conduct redeterminations with respect to appeals of claims; operate a Provider Customer Service Program (PCSP) which will educate providers with respect to the Medicare program; will respond to provider telephone and written inquiries; will respond to complex inquiries from Beneficiary Contact Centers (BCCs); and will make coverage decisions for new procedures and devices in local areas. The Contractor also will conduct a variety of provider services, such as enrollment of new providers in the program, answering written inquiries, and educating providers with respect to Medicare's rules, regulations, and billing procedures.</p>
<p>CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for Jurisdiction N (which includes the states and territories of Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands) on or about November 9, 2012. The contract will include a base year plus four one-year options. The anticipated proposal due date is January 11, 2013 with an anticipated award date of May 17, 2013.<br /><br /><br />This solicitation is expected to be issued as pending availability of funds.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by CGS under contract number HHSM-500-2010-M0002Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. <br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<p dir="ltr" align="left">Description: NSN 2910-01-338-9383 - Pump, Fuel, Metering and Distributing being bought in accordance with Coltec Industries (82796) P/N: 16611070. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 2 each to be shipped to (W62G2T) Stockton CA 95296-0130 and 35 each to be shipped to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5001. FOB destination and inspection at destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp"><span>http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp</span></a><span> <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">after the issue date of 13 November 2012.</span> Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance. The required delivery is 390 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. <br /><br /></em></strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Reverse Auction:</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;The Contracting officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offers, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for modification, minor design, remanufacture, and testing of one lanyard deployable boom for the Deep Space Climate Observer (DSCOVR) program. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from ATK Space Systems, Inc. ATKs experience building the original Boom for the Triana program provides ATK with unique knowledge on the mechanical and electrical design of the original Boom which can be readily transferred to the modification of the original design, manufacture and test of the modified Boom.	Additionally, the knowledge that ATK has in terms of the mechanical and electrical interfaces to the observatory eliminates the need to transfer the commanding, telemetry and physical mounting details to a different contractor.  ATK also possesses institutional knowledge and proprietary data which is essential to minimizing the costs of the redesigned Boom. ATKs knowledge of the deployable Boom work they performed on Triana will allow them to immediately begin the work needed to fulfill the contract.  Because ATK provided the Triana Boom to NASA, their institutional knowledge of how the Boom is built, the ability to operate the equipment needed to run the Boom, and the additional internal documents they possess give them an indisputable capability to efficiently build and test the DSCOVR Boom. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Sherika D. Wilson via email at Sherika.D.Wilson@nasa.gov or fax to (301) 286-0383, (email preferred) not later than 2:30 p.m. local time on November 9, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

The Miro M310 is the only high speed camera capable of sampling at 3200 frames per second at HD resolution (1280x800) within a footprint of 7.5 x 3.5 x 4.  These are the maximum possible camera dimensions, since the cameras will be housed in a COTS active cooled enclosure that can fit cameras with a maximum dimension of 8x4x4.3.  These cameras can segment their memory, effectively minimizing the dead time between acquisitions to 25 ms or less.  The cameras TTL trigger input port allows them to be triggered remotely by the lightning instrumentation system, which initiates the automatic remote download of the high speed camera data to the remote control computer.  The cameras memory segmenting capability allows the camera to select the next available memory segment to store the subsequent video file while minimizing the dead time. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

  The WHEMAC contract will be valid for ordering future requirements for up to five (5) years (i.e. base ordering period of one year, with option for four additional one year ordering periods) from date of award, or when the total value of the WHEMAC reaches $30,000,000.00, whichever occurs first.

<DESC>This announcement is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will conduct an Industry Day conference on 8 November 2012 at the Washington Navy Yard, 1454 Parsons Blvd., Bldg. 211, Washington D.C. The event will begin at 0830 and end no later than 1600 EST.  This conference will be hosted by NAVSEA 04FP, Program Management Office for Information Technology, for the purpose of discussing the electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) initiatives technical requirements and acquisition plans.
eTWD is a NAVSEA led, Reduction in Total Ownership Cost (R-TOC) Initiative that will reduced the cost of ship maintenance in the U.S.
 Navys Naval Shipyards. It will replace resource-intensive, paper based ship repair work instructions with an electronic technical work document. The eTWD will integrate work instructions, drawings, data tables, verification signatures and work control forms into an online certifiable document.  It will validate recorded data, auto-populate required forms, and enable online problem identification and resolution. Lastly, upon job completion, certification will be an electronic function within the eTWD that authenticates proper accomplishment of all work, endorsements and tests to specified parameters.  The overall goals of the eTWD Initiative are to reduce the resources and time required to author, compile, issue, execute and certify work while at the same time enabling the non-stop execution of work.
 
This Industry Day will begin with a discussion and overview of the eTWD Initiative followed by discussions about the technical requirements, acquisition plan and a Question and Answers period.  This eTWD Industry Day continues the planning and acquisition activities that began with a Request-For- Information published in August of 2011 (i.e., N0010411IQU20).  
Along with this Industry Day announcement, NAVSEA has attached a draft of the Statement of Work, SOW Attachments and related Business Process flow charts.

(a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.

<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for research focusing in the areas of Environmental Restoration, Munitions Response, Resource Conservation and Climate Change, and Weapons Systems and Platforms technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare DoD SERDP's intent to competitively fund research and development for environmental research that addresses the Statements of Need set forth in the Announcement. SERDP supports environmental research relevant to the management and mission of the DoD and supports efforts that lead to the development and application of innovative environmental technologies or methods that improve the environmental performance of DoD by improving outcomes, managing environmental risks, and/or reducing costs or time required to resolve environmental problems.
<p>The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions are found on the DoD SERDP website at <em>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/SERDP-Solicitations/Non-Federal-Core-Proposal-Instructions</em>. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with all instructions on the SERDP website no later than 2:00 PM Eastern Time on Tuesday, January 8, 2013. No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.</p>
<p>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Submission of pre-proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.</p>
<p>There is no commitment by SERDP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made. It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $8.0 million will be made dependent on the quality of proposals received and availability of funds.</p>
<p><br />Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit research pre-proposals for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal. Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by SERDP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether SERDP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Personnel, and Cost. Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, SERDP will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Evaluation criteria for full proposals will include Transition Plan and Small Business Participation, in addition to the criteria above.</p>
<p>Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value. If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $4.5M respectively. Prior to award, selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The HECSA Small Business Office website at <em>www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb</em> provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.</p>

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist that would like to become qualified to manufacture the fuel probes for the F-16 aircraft. Any future requirements for this effort will be restricted to qualified sources.</p>
<p>The following are the NSNs and part numbers for which the government is seeking sources:</p>
<p>NSN: 6680-01-058-3530; Part Number: 16VE002008-4<br />NSN: 6680-01-058-3531; Part Number: 16VE002008-5</p>
<p>Attached to this sources sought notice are qualification requirements to become a qualified source. Interested sources are encouraged to follow these instructions implicitly.</p>
<p>The Air Force has data and drawings to assist an interested party with the qualification process. The applicable data is linked to this notice. The data is export controlled; therefore, a company must be a DoD contractor to access which means a DD Form 2345 must be on file with the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS).</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid. The government assumes no responsibility for costs incurred by the contractor during the qualification process; therefore, response is voluntary. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement.</p>
<p>Upon completion of this sources sought synopsis, the Government is contemplating a five-year contracting arrangement for manufacture of these parts. The government is also contemplating a total small business set-aside since at least two of the current qualified sources are small businesses.</p>

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 5 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Water Mission Area, Office of Water Quality, National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) has a requirement for a software maintenance agreement to provide continuing support of the Laboratory Information Management System(LIMS) in use at the NWQL. Three-tier architecture has the following tiers: Presentation tier This is the topmost level of the application and, in the case of StarLIMS, is contained in a compiled executable distributed by StarLIMS when any licenses are purchased. The presentation tier displays information that needs to be accessed by laboratory users. It communicates with other tiers by outputting results to the graphical user interface or passing information to the relation database management system (RDBMS). When developed by a software vendor, this tier and its associated source code is owned and maintained by the vendor. The NWQL does not have any access to the source code. Application tier - otherwise known as the business logic, logic tier, data access tier, or middle tier The logic tier is pulled out from the presentation tier and, as its own layer; it controls an applications functionality by performing detailed processing. This is the tier within StarLIMS that contains all of the custom functionality developed by the NWQL programmers and this now differs significantly from the middle tier that StarLIMS now delivers with StarLIMS 10 version of its software. Data tier This tier consists of database servers. Here information is stored and retrieved. This tier keeps data neutral and independent from application servers or business logic. Giving data its own tier also improves scalability and performance. However, both the presentation tier and the application tier must be designed to interact with the data tier. There are date and tables located within the data tier that are only accessed by the presentation tier and if those tables are not upgraded when the presentation tier is upgraded or if they are modified without maintaining the correct relationship with the presentation tier then the presentation layer will fail and the software will not function properly. StarLIMS is unique for this procurement because only StarLIMS has the source code for the presentation tier, which is the base tier used to display the application to the user. Any changes made to the presentation tier by StarLIMS could affect both the application tier and the data tier because the table structure and queries used by the presentation layer are unknown to anyone outside of StarLIMS. Therefore, the design, development, maintenance, and support of the software, especially the software used by the presentation tier, remains solely with StarLIMS Corporation. In addition, update rights to new versions can only be given by StarLIMS. Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from StarLIMS Corporation and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business October 30, 2012 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time. This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>The Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) located in Washington, DC is conducting market research regarding the use of Bundling for VA101-13-R-0005; Project Number is 657-313, Clinic & Tenant Construction, Jefferson Barracks Division of the St Louis VA Medical Center in St Louis, Missouri.  Please provide comments to me within fifteen (15) days from the posting date of this announcement.  Contract bundling is defined as consolidating two or more procurement requirements for goods or services previously provided or performed under separate, smaller contracts into a solicitation of offers for a single contract that is unlikely to be suitable for award to a small business concern.
 
Federal Acquisition Regulation states that market research may indicate that bundling is necessary and justified if an agency or the Government would derive measurably substantial benefits.  Measurably substantial benefits may include, individually or in any combination or aggregate, cost savings or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits. 

Both the clinic and the tenant facilities are critical to the success of the ongoing VA mission and delays to acquisition would be detrimental to both the overall project phasing (including future acquisition) and the ongoing missions being carried out on the Jefferson Barracks campus.  Specifically, delays to acquisition and construction of the new clinic would adversely affect the delivery of healthcare to veterans while similar delay of the tenant facility would jeopardize the project phasing plan by delaying tenant moves from existing facilities that must be demolished to make way for other construction.

The clinic project includes approximately 112,900 gross square of new construction in the foot print of two existing buildings (buildings 50 and 64, totaling approximately 113,600 gross square feet) to be demolished.  The existing building 50 occupants will relocate to temporary trailers on the northwest end of the campus for the duration of construction (which only has limited parking).  The project will require about 25,400 cubic yards of fill for which there are no borrow pits onsite to obtain or stockpile such material.  It will also include completion of the campus utility loops that specifically serve the new clinic.  The estimated magnitude for this project is between $50 and $100 million.

The tenant project will construct an approximately 86,000 gross square foot building in an area of the campus that is mostly parking lot.  When complete, it will provide space for a number of tenant organizations that will vacate existing buildings which, will either be renovated for occupancy by other tenants so they can vacate their buildings, or will be demolished by subsequent phases.  The tenant construction will involve excavation and removal of approximately 10,000 cubic yards of soil for which there are no borrow pits onsite to stockpile this material.  The estimated magnitude for this project is between $20 and $50 million.

Aspects of the construction associated with the clinic and tenant buildings that could be separated without adverse impact to safety, schedule, or medical center operations have been broken out as separate contract packages to be advertised in later phases in an attempt to mitigate the adverse impact to opportunities for small business.  These separate contract packages are likely to generate interest from more than one small business and market research may demonstrate them suitable for small business set asides.  These projects, each with an estimated magnitude of between $1 and $2 million, include: (1) Demo of buildings 70, 70A, 71, 82 and site work,  (2) Reconfiguration of south campus parking , (3) Campus Perimeter Fence, and (4) Path of Honor site work.

Within fifteen (15) days of the posting date of this announcement, please provide comments to noella.bond@va.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for non-waterproof, hot weather mountain combat boots. The goal of this effort is to indentify firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop boots for use by the combat soldier in rugged mountainous terrains and conditions. Interest is in readily available product(s) or information on development that will be available within the next six to twelve months (must be based on a concise and attainable development/commercialization plan). The hot weather mountain combat boots must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) durable, light hiking-style mountain boot that reduces shock impact while enhancing stability and support to the ankle. These boots, though stiffer and slightly heavier than traditional combat boots, are specially constructed to support movement and stabilize the foot and the ankle over more rugged terrain. 2) Provides for maximum breathability and water drainage during hot, wet conditions. 3) Outsoles that provide propulsion and torsional support while allow for breaking and stability while moving down and unstable decline. 4) Able to keep trail debris out of boot while maneuvering. 5) Designed to reduce pressure points and discomfort during descents on uneven, rugged terrain. 6) Prevents blistering during extended use. 7) Neutral color [such as olive, brown or coyote]. 8) Provide for quick break-in. 9) Stiff-soled with tread that grips rocky terrain and loose, however flexible enough to remain comfortable for long periods of activity. Interested sources must, within fourteen (14) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and a single product sample (10R) if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provide pricing for currently available product and/or estimated pricing for footwear currently under development. Firms responding shall indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only. Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Robert Hall, U.S. Army NSRDEC, RDNS-WPW-C, D-323, Natick, MA 01760-5019. This is not a request for quotations. No solicitation document exists.

<DESC>The Washington Homeland Security Roundtable (WHSR) today announced it will host a series of focus groups, in collaboration with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), as part of its on-going WHSR / TSA Industry Forum and outreach initiative which was launched on June 5th.
<p>The first in the series, the Contracting / Acquisition Policy Focus Group will be held on Tuesday, November 6th from 2:30pm to 4:00pm at TSA Headquarters. This focus group will be limited to 15 companies (1 representative only) and open to both WHSR members and non-members. Additional focus groups will be announced over the next few weeks and will concentrate on areas such as small business and industry engagement, among others. Topics addressed by the focus groups may be defined by TSA or TSA may request suggestions from participants. Quarterly meetings are currently anticipated, with this frequency subject to change.</p>
<p>The main objective of the Contracting / Acquisition Policy Focus Group is to obtain participants' input and review of the policies, regulations and current practices that drive the "content" and costs of the contracting process at TSA. The intent is to identify policies, regulations, and practices that provide little or no added value, in terms of cost, schedule or risk, as well as those policies, regulations, and practices that could be improved to help reduce costs and acquisition cycle time. The review may also include clauses and other solicitation/contract language that may be unnecessarily adding costs and /or cycle time to our hardware and support contracts. As part of the Focus Group, parties may be invited to provide suggested revisions to the policies, regulations and practices used in TSA's contracting process. Any potential revisions that can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the contracting process are of particular interest. As part of this effort, it is important to recognize that much of what drives the contracting/acquisition process is derived from federal law and regulations and may not be alterable. The collection of best practices and identification of technological advances in the contracting process may also be desired.</p>
<p>To register for the Contracting / Acquisition Policy Focus Group, please visit www.whsroundtable.org/AcquisitionPolicyGroup. Participation is limited to 15 companies (1 representative only) and open to both WHSR members and non-members. Traditional and non-traditional contractors and all types of small businesses are encouraged to participate. All participants must be registered in CCR to be eligible to participate. Registration opens at noon on October 30, 2012.</p>
<p>For more information on additional focus groups please contact WHSR. Registration for the additional focus groups will be announced in FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>WHSR, founded in 2003, is a 501c(6) non-profit group of individuals from companies who are actively engaged in homeland security policies, practices, procedures, and procurements as a user or supplier of homeland security equipment or services.</p>

<p>B. Price Evaluation.

Price will contribute substantially to the source selection decision, and the source selection will be conducted with the expectation of adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), therefore, cost or pricing data are not required.

The Government may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 15.404-1(b): comparison of proposed prices received, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices, use of parametric estimating/rough yardsticks, comparison with competitive published price lists or market prices, comparison with independent Government cost estimates, comparison with market research, and analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. If the price analysis techniques are insufficient to make a determination of price reasonableness, the CO may request information other than cost or pricing data in order to make a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(2) To the extent necessary, the CO may use other proposal analysis techniques, such as technical analysis and cost analysis to determine price reasonableness. In addition, proposed unit prices will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing (FAR 15.404-1(g)). Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable TEP, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line item appears to be significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. An offeror's proposal may be rejected if the CO determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. Also a contract will not be awarded to an offeror whose price is not determined reasonable.<br /><br />C. Past Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate past performance to assess how well the offeror performed work relevant to the type of effort and type of requirement described in the solicitation as an indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>The Government will use the following procedures in evaluating past performance:</p>
<p>(1) Recency is defined as performance occurring within the last three (3) years of the date of this solicitation, except that ongoing programs must have begun no less than three (3) months from issuance of the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) The Government will evaluate the relevancy of offeror's past performance and assign ratings of Relevant or Not Relevant:</p>
<p>PAST PERFROMANCE RELEVANCY DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of<br />effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and<br />magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />(3) The Government will determine how well the contractor performed on past contracts and assign ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See note below).</p>
<p>Unacceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to<br />have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(4) Sources of past performance information for evaluation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Offeror's shall submit past performance information on at least one (1) but no more than three (3) recent contracts during the past three (3) years from RFP date that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Complete and submit information required in the Addendum to 52.212-1 of the RFP "Past Performance Information," for each of these contracts.</p>
<p>(b) Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government to include PPIRS or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, COs, and Fee-Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The past performance evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the requirements of this solicitation. See FAR 15.101-2(b)(1) for treatment of past performance relative to small business. Failure to receive an acceptable past performance rating may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>D. After initial evaluation of each offeror's technical and price proposals, and assessment of each offeror's past performance, if the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable past<br />performance assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror without entering into discussions as this represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Offerors shall submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Proposal Preparation Instructions in the Addendum to 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past<br />performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Exchanges conducted with regard to adverse past performance or to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions, and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>F. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If the Government elects to hold discussions, a competitive range may be established based on FAR 15.306(c) procedures and this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to further limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the CO determines that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal will be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505 or 15.506.</p>
<p>G. After conclusion of discussions and receipt of final proposal revisions, the Government will make an award to the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) that is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable performance assessment rating, as this represents the best value to the Government.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Offerors are reminded that Representations and Certifications are maintained at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicserach.aspx.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

This is a synopsis of a  Repair Requirement for a Long Term Contract with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, Stratford, CT and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair.  Please see attached documentation for exact listing of NIINs.

Orders issued under the LTC and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. While the Sr. Transition Specialist may be supervised by any OTI team or division leader or his/her designee, the initial supervisor for the position under this solicitation will be OTI's Program Learning, and Innovation leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>The incumbent for this position will be expected to initially work with the Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI), which develops, oversees, and manages critical processes supporting the implementation of OTI country programs.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the PLI Division engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.  The Senior Transition Advisor will provide regular guidance and leadership for the OTI Applied Best Practices and Learning (ABC) team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of ABC staff focusing on learning, training, innovation, monitoring and evaluation, and development of technology tools in support of OTI country programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire a Senior Transition Specialist who will lead the newly-formed Monitoring, Evaluation and Training (MONET) unit within the Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Senior Transition Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the OTI Senior Transition Specialist requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The OTI Senior Transition Specialist is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The OTI Senior Transition Specialist is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The OTI Senior Transition Specialist has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The OTI Senior Transition Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with supervisor. The Washington-based Senior Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p><br />&bull;	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field<br />including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance, including providing supervisory support;</p>
<p>&bull;	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, recommend strategic courses of action, facilitate closeout meetings, and provide ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the<br />development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews,<br />preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull;	Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a liaison with other Bureau of Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI supervisor, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull;	Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in<br />Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, supervise staff as delegated by the OTI supervisor (e.g.  Technical Advisors, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, act as Division Leader, or in other team roles;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide other services as required to fulfill OTI's program objectives.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />It is expected that the Senior Transition Specialist will take direction from and will initially report to OTI's Chief of Program, Learning, and Innovation Division or his/her designee.

<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on assessment teams, Country Start-Ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Assessments, Country Start-ups, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>
<p>12.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.</p>
<p>13.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Two years, with three one-year options</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Applied Best Practices &amp; Coordination (ABC) team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation. The ABC team currently is comprised of two units: The Monitoring, Evaluation, and Training Unit provides guidance and support on monitoring and evaluation and advises on OTI's strategic management processes throughout the life of the program cycle.  It also builds the knowledge, skills, and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve both country program performance as well as their own professional development.  The Information Design Lab promotes innovation, knowledge sharing, and analysis to strengthen country programs through the application of technology and new approaches.  These units coordinate closely with each other as well as with teams and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>The Program Performance Management Specialist/Sr. Program Performance Management Specialist positions utilize the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of best practices, including dynamic monitoring, evaluation, and learning in fast-paced, short-term political transition and stabilization programs in complex environments.</p>
<p>In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Program Performance Management Specialist/Sr. Program Performance Management Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information, training, and support they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be providing expertise and support for action learning, knowledge sharing, monitoring, and evaluation of OTI's field programs.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To provide direct support in political transition program implementation under OTI's Program, Learning and Innovation division.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable best value source selection. Award will be made to the lowest evaluated price offeror that is determined to have a technically acceptable proposal and receives an acceptable past performance rating. <br />The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. The Government will evaluate the technical proposals and assign ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>(1) The offeror's proposal shall, at a minimum, address each of the sub factors in (3) below, as they apply to the PWS. Detailed instructions are included in the proposal preparation instructions section of this solicitation. During evaluation of each proposal, the Government<br />will assign each sub factor a rating as shown in table (2) below. A rating of unacceptable in one or more technical sub factors will constitute an overall rating of unacceptable for the technical evaluation and may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>(2) The ratings consist of:</p>
<p>TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />(3) Description of Sub factors:</p>
<p>(a) Sub factor: Long Term Lodging</p>
<p>Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to provide sufficient documentation that clearly demonstrates the ability to provide Long Term Lodging facilities IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>(b) Sub factor: Transportation</p>
<p>Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to provide organization's approach to meeting all student transportation requirements IAW the PWS.</p>
<p>(c) Sub factor: Proximity to leisure activities.</p>
<p>Description of Sub factor: Contractor is required to submit a description of amenities within shuttle distance provided by your facility i.e. dinning, malls, and recreational facilities.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. The Government will evaluate the price proposals, and any other relevant proposal data submitted, to determine if proposed prices are reasonable and balanced based on the offeror (s) proposed approach. Price will contribute substantially to the source selection decision, and the source selection will be conducted with the expectation of adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), therefore, cost or pricing data are not required. However, the offeror may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the CO to determine price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(1) For the purposes of the initial price evaluation, the offeror shall submit Description of Services CLINS 0001 and 0002. Any other information provided by the offeror will not be considered or evaluated. All proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness. The offeror's Total Evaluated Price will be calculated as the sum of the Firm-Fixed-Price CLINs 0001-0002. The Government may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 15.404-1(b): comparison of proposed prices received, comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices, use of parametric estimating/rough yardsticks, comparison with competitive published price lists or market prices, comparison with independent Government cost estimates, comparison with market research, and analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. If the price analysis techniques are insufficient to make a determination of price reasonableness, the CO may request information other than cost or pricing data in order to make a determination of price reasonableness.</p>
<p>(2) To the extent necessary, the CO may use other proposal analysis techniques, such as technical analysis and cost analysis to determine price reasonableness. In addition, proposed unit prices will be evaluated for unbalanced pricing (FAR 15.404-1(g)). Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable TEP, the price of one or more contract line items or sub line item appears to be significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. An offeror's proposal may be rejected if the CO determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. Also a contract will not be awarded to an offeror whose price is not determined reasonable.<br /><br />C. Past Performance Evaluation. The Government will evaluate past performance to assess how well the offeror performed work relevant to the type of effort and type of requirement described in the solicitation as an indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>The Government will use the following procedures in evaluating past performance:</p>
<p>(1) Recency is defined as performance occurring within the last three (3) years of the date of this solicitation, except that ongoing programs must have begun no less than three (3) months from issuance of the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) The Government will evaluate the relevancy of offeror's past performance and assign ratings of Relevant or Not Relevant:</p>
<p>PAST PERFROMANCE RELEVANCY DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of<br />effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and<br />magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br /><br />(3) The Government will determine how well the contractor performed on past contracts and assign ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>RATING DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Acceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See note below).</p>
<p>Unacceptable</p>
<p>Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to<br />have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(4) Sources of past performance information for evaluation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Offeror's shall submit past performance information on at least one (1) but no more than three (3) recent contracts during the past three (3) years from RFP date that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Complete and submit information required in the Addendum to 52.212-1 of the RFP "Past Performance Information," for each of these contracts.</p>
<p>(b) Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the Government to include PPIRS or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, COs, and Fee-Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The past performance evaluation team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the requirements of this solicitation. See FAR 15.101-2(b)(1) for treatment of past performance relative to small business. Failure to receive an acceptable past performance rating may result in the entire proposal being eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>D. After initial evaluation of each offeror's technical and price proposals, and assessment of each offeror's past performance, if the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable past<br />performance assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror without entering into discussions as this represents the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. Offerors shall submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Proposal Preparation Instructions in the Addendum to 52.212-1. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past<br />performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Exchanges conducted with regard to adverse past performance or to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions, and the CO reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>F. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If the Government elects to hold discussions, a competitive range may be established based on FAR 15.306(c) procedures and this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to further limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. If the CO determines that an offeror's proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal will be eliminated from consideration for award. Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors in accordance with FAR 15.503. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505 or 15.506.</p>
<p>G. After conclusion of discussions and receipt of final proposal revisions, the Government will make an award to the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) that is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has an acceptable performance assessment rating, as this represents the best value to the Government.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Offerors are reminded that Representations and Certifications are maintained at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicserach.aspx.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

All offerors must carefully review the delivery requirement in the request for quote or solicitation. When submitting an offer/bid, please ensure that you can meet the delivery schedule. <br /><br />On time delivery is very critical. Therefore, offerors must adhere to the delivery requirements indicated in any resultant award. Failure to comply with the contractual delivery schedule, may result in termination of the order or require consideration if the government elects to extend delivery. The Government is not required to extend your delivery schedule if you encounter delays. The non-availability of raw materials, subcontractor issues, scheduling conflicts, etc., should be considered at the time you are submitting your offer/bid. They are not acceptable excuses for failing to meet the delivery after award. <br /><br />Ensuring that you can provide quality products that conform to the contract is just as important as meeting the required delivery schedule. Delivery of non-conforming products results in delivery delays and increased costs to the Government. <br /><br />Please note that if you receive this award, your performance under this contract (including timeliness of deliveries and the quality of supplies/services delivered) will be monitored and recorded by this contracting office. This information may be used to determine a record of past performance for future contract awards. Contractors/offerors that are concerned about their record of past performance may contact this office if they wish to view and discuss their records.<br /><br />EVALUATION OF AWARD <br /><br />(1) Price: The Government will evaluate quotes based on prices quoted in the paragraph (v) of this solicitation. <br /><br />(2) Past Performance: This factor will be based on information obtained from any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. Data maintained by this contracting office may include an offeror's record of performance on previous contracts issued by this contracting office. Quotes received from vendors with no past performance history information will be evaluated based on information obtained from various sources, such as contracting agency experience with the contractor, previous contract history available from DCMA, etc. The Government does not intend to discuss any negative Past Performance data with offerors, if that data is contained in the JMTC contracting office's own records on past contract performance, or PPIRS-SR database. <br /><br />The Government intends to make a single award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, based on an integrated analysis of each offeror's Past Performance and Price. The final award decision will be a trade-off between Past Performance and price, with the Past Performance factor being more important than price.<br /><br />The Government will develop a Past Performance rating for each offeror, based on the Past Performance information described above. This may include numerically-generated scores (such as PPIRS-SR), narrative information contained in this contracting office's own databases, or descriptions provided by references. The contracting officer will analyze this information and develop an adjectival rating, going from "Low Risk" to "Medium Risk" and finally "High Risk". Offerors who have no past performance information will be assigned a "Neutral Risk" rating.<br /><br />The contracting officer will perform a trade-off analysis based on the assigned Past Performance rating and price for each proposal. In determining the best value to the Government, award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal. While the Past Performance factor is more important than price, the price factor may become controlling as Past Performance ratings tend to equalize. <br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUOTE SUBMISSION<br /><br />The Government intends to make an award based on a best value basis. This process will involve a trade-off analysis, if applicable, between Price and Performance Risk. This may result in award to other than the low quote and/or other than the highest rated (best performance risk) quote. <br /><br />For the evaluation of Performance Risk, the Government will obtain information from the any sources available to the JMTC Contracting Office, including the PD2 Vendor Performance Database for the JMTC Contracting Office, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System- Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) and other records maintained by the JMTC Contracting Office or other agencies. You are not required to submit any additional information on Performance Risk. The Government does not intend to discuss performance risk information with the offerors.<br /><br />FAR 30.202-1(a) DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FORM<br /><br />Disclosure Statement, Form CASB-DS-1, is not included in this solicitation<br />package. Any offeror meeting the criteria for concurrent submission of the<br />Disclosure Statement, who has not previously received the form from another Government source, will immediately contact the cognizant ACO (See DOD Directory of Contract Administration Components (DOD 4105.59H)) to obtain a copy of the form. If the form is not promptly made available by the ACO, the offeror will immediately so advise the PCO, who will provide one copy of the form. Offeror will be responsible for reproducing the complete form in sufficient number of copies required for submission.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures. (End of Provision) <BR> <BR>QUESTION:  There are several events scheduled that have either the tents requested or the chairs requested.  Wouldn't it make sense that on those days the requests would be for both items. ANSWER:  Some days the chairs are only needed for retirement ceremony (indoors) others are DA level ceremonies (outside). QUESTION:  Are there a specific type of chair that is prefered? ANSWER:  Chairs are not specific, only that they are all the same.  All equipment must  be in good working condition, free of tears, free of burns, free of stains, must be sturdy and safe for use. <BR> <BR>

For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below: (1) "Trade Secret" means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials which are trade commodities. (2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information. (f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program. In addition, this system shall maintain interoperability with IPv4 systems and provide at least the same level of performance and reliability capabilities of IPv4 products. (b) Specifically, any new IP product or system developed, acquired, or produced must: Intemperate with both IPv6 and IPv4 systems and products, and have available contractor/vendor IPv6 technical support for development and implementation and fielded product management. (c) As IPv6 evolves, the Contractor commits to upgrading or providing an appropriate migration path for each item developed, delivered or utilized at no additional cost to the Government. The Contractor shall retrofit all non-IPv6 capable equipment, as defined above, that is fielded under this contract with IPv6 capable equipment, at no additional cost to the Government. (d) The contractor shall provide technical support for both IPv4 and IPv6. (e) Any system or software must be able to operate on networks supporting IPv4, IPv6 or one that supports both.. (f) Any product whose non-compliance is discovered and made known to the Contractor within one year after acceptance shall be upgraded, modified or replaced to bring it into compliance at no additional cost to the Government. <BR> <BR>In accordance with AQD Policy NBCM-ACQ- 6900-052, titled Policy for Greening Services Contracts, the following language shall be included in the Requirements Document (SOW, SOO, or PWS) for all AQD mod-zero contracts for services: AQD Services Greening Clause Almost every service requires the use of some sort of product.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<p>Raya Holding was established in 1999 when seven leading Egyptian ICT companies merged to create the Middle East's largest ICT company. The 3,000-employee company has four main lines of business: IT services for business applications; call center services; distribution and retail of mobile phones and other consumer electronics; and smart building development. In addition, Raya Holding serves international markets, mostly in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf and the Levant, through its Raya International Services division. In 2008, Raya Holding inaugurated its first Raya Data Center facility, in partnership with Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Cisco, Dell, and EMC, in the neighborhood known as the 6th of October City outside of Cairo. The facility, the only ISO/IEC 27001 certified data center provider in Egypt, spans over 350 m2 and offers a range of services from web servers to complex online applications, email solutions, security and storage services. Raya Holding is a Cisco Gold Certified Partner, a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, an Oracle Certified Advantage Partner, and a HP Preferred Gold Partner, serving as both a reseller and systems integrator for the partner companies.</p>
<p>In response to rapidly increasing demand, Raya Holding intends to expand its data center offerings with an estimated $20.4 million investment over three years to build a new 1,000 m2 data center that includes cloud service capabilities. A full spectrum of cloud services would be offered, including solutions for private cloud deployments; co-location and hosting services; traditional ICT managed services; public cloud services for enterprises; and offerings such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Raya Holding has taken several steps to support this new data center, including the creation in February 2012 of a new line of business called the Raya Data Center; the appointment of Ms. Reem Asaad as CEO for the new data center; and the allocation of approximately $1 million (EGP 6 million) from its 2012 budget for the purchase of land for the new data center. Raya Holding is currently evaluating land acquisition opportunities in the Cairo neighborhoods of New Cairo and Maadi.</p>
<p>To guide this major investment, Raya Holding requires a comprehensive analysis and feasibility study. The Study will combine technological, business and strategic planning as well as market analysis and specialized consultation on service definition and implementation planning. Specifically, the Study will: (1) research and analyze the data center and cloud services market demand in the Middle East and Africa; (2) develop a strategic plan for the data center based on an assessment of Raya Holding's current capabilities; (3) develop a business plan and vision for the data center, including risk analysis, long-term development options, financial forecasts and return on investment analysis; and (4) determine the fundamental design requirements, budget, implementation plan, and procurement package for the data center and (5) Cloud Strategy and its design, implementation plan, procurement package)</p>

<p>"The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC>To:       All Requestors of the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity for Firewood Services within Rocky Mountain National Park
Re: 	CC-ROMO004-13 and CC-ROMO007-13 Errata No. 1 and Responses to Questions Received 
Errata No. 1: 
This notice updates the prospectus issued by the National Park Service on September 26, 2012.
Business Opportunity pages 3 and 5 Draft Contract page 3
Correction - name of campground CC-ROMO004 operates in four campground locations on the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park. The campground locations are: Aspenglen, Moraine Park, Glacier Basin and Longs Peak. 
Draft Contract, Exhibit C Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements
Correction  - location of firewood shed CC-ROMO004-13, Draft Contract Exhibit C Assigned Land and Real Property Improvements includes maps depicting Concessioner's land assignments in the four campgrounds. The Longs Peak Campground map shows the location of the firewood shed as being within the interior of the campground loop access road. The actual location of the firewood shed is on the exterior of the campground loop access road as shown in the Longs Peak Campground Map. See Errata No. 1 and Questions/Responses at: http://www.concessions.nps.gov/romo004-007-13.htm
Responses to Questions Received: 
1.	The wording on bundle description for Long Peak is different than the others.   The word "included" would imply that each bundle would have to include kindling.   The other sites it looks like the sale of a separate package of kindling is specified.   The question:  Does the sale of a separate bundle of kindling at each location meet the requirements? Staffing the firewood operation at Longs Peak Campground is optional. If the operation is not staffed, each bundle must include kindling. If the operation is staffed, bundled kindling is approved to be sold separately. 
2.	Is power nearby at Longs Peak to be extended to the sales location at concessionaires expense? Yes, there is power nearby. However, the Service does not have plans to extend power service to the wood sales location. Furthermore, the Draft Category II Contract does not allow capital improvement projects at the Concessioner's expense. 
 3.	Is Cell service available at each site?  This would allow acceptance of debit and credit cards. Cell phone coverage within the Park is sporadic and largely dependent on the cell phone provider. The Service cannot guarantee that there is cell coverage available at each site. 4.	The 2011 approved rates are included, what are the 2012 rates? There was no increase in the rates approved for the 2012 operating season. Please refer to Page 4 of the Business Opportunity.
5.	Is the percentage of firewood sales (or dollar amount) in the historical gross revenue figure available?  Since the pro forma requests a line item for firewood revenues a break out would be very useful. CC-ROMO004-03: 2007	$77,770 2008	$80,008 2009	$71,072 2010	$81,968 2011	$68,877 		



CC-ROMO007-03: Firewood revenue is 100 % of total gross receipts.
6.	Is the number of occupied campsite nights available for each location? The Service does not have specific statistics, but estimates the number of occupied nights at a minimum of 90%.  7.	Are pictures of current wood sheds available? Yes.  See Errata No. 1 and Questions/Responses at: http://www.concessions.nps.gov/romo004-007-13.htm
8.	Would wood that is USDA certified pest free be allowed if from outside of N. Colorado? Yes. The Concessioner must provide the Service with documentation that certifies the wood is USDA pest-free.  9.	There is no description of what type of wood is allowed.  Is softwood (pine) allowed? Pine or aspen or a mixture of both is allowed. 
10.	If no agreement can be reached on the existing sheds and new sheds need to be built I have the following questions. CC-ROMO004-13 a)	Are any state, county or local permits required?  No.  Please see note included in response to No. 11 below. b)	Would the new sheds have to have the exact same footprint as the existing? No, but overall dimensions may not exceed two linear feet of the length or width of the existing sheds.  c)	Could they have the same square footage, but a different dimension? Please see response to #2. d)	Could they have a larger square footage?  Please see response to #2.
CC-ROMO007-13:  The firewood storage shed in Timber Creek Campground is Government Personal Property and will be assigned to the Concessioner.
11.	It is required that the new sheds be "portable".   Yes Does this mean that: a)	 They cannot have a foundation? Correct a)	Must be removed each season? No b)	Must be mounted on skids or wheels? No  Note: The Service will not approve on-site construction of wood sheds. Wood sheds must be portable; prefabricated and assembled on site or pre-built and transported to respective land assignments within the campgrounds.
12.	What are the current posted hours for staffed firewood sales at each campground? CC-ROMO004-03 		Moraine Park Campground:  5:30-7:30 PM Glacier Basin Campground:  5:30-7:30 PM Aspenglen Campground:  5:30-7:30 PM Long's Peak Campground: 6:00-7:30PM CC-ROMO007-03		Timber Creek Campground: 8:00 AM-8:00 PM
13.	Is self-pay currently allowed for hours of the day that are not covered by staffed sales? Concession Contract ROMO004-03: No Concession Contract ROMO007-03: Yes 
14.	Is self-pay allowable in addition to the staffed sales hours?  Draft Contract ROMO004-13: No  Draft Contract ROMO007-13: Yes

<DESC>This announcement is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.
Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will conduct an Industry Day conference on 8 November 2012 at the Washington Navy Yard, 1454 Parsons Blvd., Bldg. 211, Washington D.C. The event will begin at 0830 and end no later than 1600 EST.  This conference will be hosted by NAVSEA 04FP, Program Management Office for Information Technology, for the purpose of discussing the electronic Technical Work Document (eTWD) initiatives technical requirements and acquisition plans.
eTWD is a NAVSEA led, Reduction in Total Ownership Cost (R-TOC) Initiative that will reduced the cost of ship maintenance in the U.S.
 Navys Naval Shipyards. It will replace resource-intensive, paper based ship repair work instructions with an electronic technical work document. The eTWD will integrate work instructions, drawings, data tables, verification signatures and work control forms into an online certifiable document.  It will validate recorded data, auto-populate required forms, and enable online problem identification and resolution. Lastly, upon job completion, certification will be an electronic function within the eTWD that authenticates proper accomplishment of all work, endorsements and tests to specified parameters.  The overall goals of the eTWD Initiative are to reduce the resources and time required to author, compile, issue, execute and certify work while at the same time enabling the non-stop execution of work.
 
This Industry Day will begin with a discussion and overview of the eTWD Initiative followed by discussions about the technical requirements, acquisition plan and a Question and Answers period.  This eTWD Industry Day continues the planning and acquisition activities that began with a Request-For- Information published in August of 2011 (i.e., N0010411IQU20).  
Along with this Industry Day announcement, NAVSEA has attached a draft of the Statement of Work, SOW Attachments and related Business Process flow charts.  This information is provided to elicit discussion and contextual understanding of the eTWD Initiatives prospective requirements. These informative documents will continue to be refined by NAVSEA and will change without industry notice or notification.
  This Industry Day Announcement (including SOW, SOW attachments and Business Process Flowcharts) does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract or order. 
      NAVSEA requests that firms interested in attending the eTWD Industry Day submit company names and attendee lists by 2PM Eastern Time, 30 October 2012 via e-mail to  Stacy Cooper at Stacy.Cooper@navy.mil and cc Alvin Hill at Alvin.L.Hill@navy.mil  .    Companies are limited to two representatives each as seating is limited. Once your guest list has been submitted, no edits, changes or additions can be made. You must have a current state issued picture ID to enter the Navy Yard.
  Firms are also encouraged to submit any questions via email to Stacy Cooper at Stacy.Cooper@navy.mil and cc Alvin Hill at Alvin.L.Hill@navy.mil no later than 02 November 2012, in order for the briefing to be as informative as possible. 
Public Parking will be available on M Street across from the Navy Yard.  You are authorized to park near Bldg. 211, in unmarked spaces, however, space is limited.

<p>The General Service Administration (GSA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather information from commercial organizations, educational institutions and non-profit organizations on new sustainable building technologies and practices in support of its Green Proving Ground (GPG) initiative.</p>

More specifically, the GPG program aims to identify technologies with the greatest potential to help meet GSA's mandated sustainability goals, particularly those contained in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance", and assess their performance in the in the real world context of operating buildings.  Notable findings from all projects will support the evolution of performance specifications for the GSA portfolio and will inform decision making at GSA, other federal agencies, and the industry in deploying the technologies studied.</p>
<p>Commercial entities, educational institutions and non-profit organizations  wishing to participate in GSA's GPG 2013 Program, including those who have previously submitted information for past years' programs, must complete the questionnaire at:<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;"><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=bz89x8971l09n" target="_blank">http://www.clicktools.com/survey?iv=bz89x8971l09n</a></span>&nbsp;. The GPG Program may review and consider submitted technologies for enhanced Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) as part of the 2013 program.  To be selected, innovative products can be (1) gifted (unconditionally) or (2) provided to GSA for testing through the use of an agreement and a payment of a fee to GSA.  Additional information may subsequently be requested.</p>
<p><br />Questions about this announcement should be directed to gpg_2013@gsa.gov.  This announcement will remain open until 5 p.m. on November 23, 2012.   <br />&emsp;<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). Responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form an agreement or binding contract of any nature. Information received may be used to assist GSA in creating an RFP and may be shared with other Federal agencies. Respondents are advised not to include any confidential business information with a response as the Government does not guarantee confidentiality of the information received. Although GSA asks that no confidential business information be submitted, it is our practice to protect the provided information and make it available on a need-to-know basis only to Government personnel and contractors who will be using this information on behalf of the Government.  However, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission or while stored in our system or otherwise in our custody or control or in the custody or control of another Federal agency, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, and GSA and the Government will have no liability whatsoever for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />UPDATE 19 (25 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide Amendment 7 and an amended RFP. For additional information, please see below:</p>
<p>(1) The only area amended in the RFP is the hand delivery instructions in Section L-4. Due to the expected high volume of proposals, offerors hand delivering their proposals need to use the loading dock on the T Street Southwest (SW) side of the Jemal Building. Upon arrival at the loading dock area, offerors should go through the brown gate and climb the stairs to enter the building at the loading dock&nbsp;guard desk. Please see the attached map for further information; note that this map is not a part of Amendment 7.</p>
<p>Please also note that the delivery building and address (1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20593) are the same as before; only the proposal reception area is being changed.</p>
<p>(2) To reiterate, all proposals are due by 3 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, March 2nd, 2011.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver proposals before Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to coordinate their proposal deliveries with Nathan Dolezal or with Katherine Powers to ensure proper proposal reception. This coordination can be done via email to Nate.Dolezal@uscg.mil&nbsp;or Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver their proposals on Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to plan accordingly due to the aforementioned proposal volume and limited parking at the Jemal Building.</p>
<p>(3) After the government receives the offeror's package, the government will provide a receipt of confirmation. This receipt is provisional pending the package successfully passing the government screening process.</p>
<p>Any offeror who has not received a confirmation receipt or is not in line at the loading dock of the Jemal Building by 3 PM EST will have their proposal considered late.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br />UPDATE 18 (17 February 2011)<br /><br />The purpose this update is to provide Amendment 6 and three amended RFP attachments.&nbsp; These documents are located&nbsp;in the lower-right hand side of this page.<br /><br />As described in Amendment 6, the three attachments have been amended as follows: <br /><br />1.)

Attachment 4 - Typographical errors have been fixed.<br /><br />3.) Attachment 10 - References have been corrected.<br /><br />The RFP and all other RFP attachments are unchanged.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix. It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts. The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix. The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions. Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future. In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments. They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>
<p>Attachments that have been changed since Amendment 4 are updated per the descriptions on the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5. Any attachment not mentioned in the Standard Form 30 in Amendment 5 is unchanged. However, all attachments are included with this update for offerors' reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the amended RFP, to reiterate:</p>
<p>(1) Paper copies of proposals are required. Please see Sections L-5 and L-6 of the amended RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(2) Labor category descriptions are provided in the amended Attachment 10. Offerors should meet those stated requirements</p>
<p>(3) For offerors' acknowledgement of amendments, please see Section L-8 of the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Evaluation Factor 3, "Socio-economic Considerations," has been significantly amended. Please see Sections L and M of the RFP for more information.</p>
<p>(5) For the $250 contractual minimum, this amount will be obligated to each contract at the time of award. It will not be provided as consideration for the contractor's requirement to attend the post-award conference. Travel expenses for post-award conferences are the responsibility of the contractor.</p>
<p>(6) The proposal due date is extended until 3 PM Eastern Standard Time on 03/02/2011.</p>
<p>With regard to the TABSS email box, it is sporadically experiencing technical difficulties; the government is working to resolve the issue.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

<CONTACT>Mark C. Green, Phone 7034323116, Email mark.c.green@usmc.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR<br />LOW METALLIC SIGNATURE MINE DETECTOR
<p><br />The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Combat Support Systems (PM CSS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources and industry capabilities to design, develop, test, manufacture and deliver the next generation handheld explosives hazard detection system, the Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMS MD).</p>
<p>1. Description: The LMS MD will be the material solution to the capability gap that currently exists in the detection of explosive devices. It is a light-weight, man-portable, handheld detection system that is capable of detecting traditional, low-metallic and non-metallic mines and explosive devices. It will enable the mobility of dismounted forces by significantly increasing their ability to locate, mark, avoid, and/or reduce explosive threats. Additionally, it will enhance explosives threat identification and categorization by discriminating between detected mines and improvised explosive devices that contain little to no metallic content, to include unexploded ordnance. As a system to be used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technicians, the discriminating capability of the LMS MD will enable the neutralization and exploitation of explosive devises with little metallic content, to include their initiating systems.</p>
<p>2. Specification: The following performance and functional characteristics represent the minimum threshold and objective level capabilities of the LMS MD.<br />a. Detection. The LMS MD shall be capable of detecting metallic, low metallic and non-metallic symmetric and asymmetric threats in dry and wet environments in loam, sand, clay and river rock test substrates containing indigenous vegetation, and in close proximity to operational vehicles. Note: Loam is defined as a combination of 40% silt, 40% sand and 20% clay. The threshold (T) probability of detection [P(d)] is 85% for baseline targets, while the objective (O) is 95% P(d) for less metallic or deeper buried threats.<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for low metallic explosive hazards (EH) with 0.09 oz. (2.5 grams) of mild steel or aluminum and low metallic asymmetric components at a depth of 4 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for high metallic EHs with 3.5 oz. (100 grams) of mild steel or aluminum at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for buried non-metallic components with a 24 square inch (sq. in.) horizontal surface area (with 3in. cross section) (T) and a 95% P(d) for a buried non-metallic component with a circular surface area equal to or less than 7 sq. in. (3in. diameter). <br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for non-metallic components with a 100 sq. in. horizontal surface area (with a 3 inch cross section) at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />b. Endurance. The LMS MD shall be capable of 8 (T) and 16.5 (O) hours of continuous active sweeping operation in climatic conditions with temperatures from -25&deg;F to +120&deg;F without degradation of system performance and/or power source recharge or replacement. The LMS MD shall use batteries that have been approved by DoD for shipboard storage/use, and aircraft transport (T), or batteries currently available within the DoD supply system (O).<br />Where applicable the LMS MD battery shall be rechargeable using 100-240VAC (50Hz-60Hz) and 11-36VDC power sources. <br />Where applicable, the LMS MD shall operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or a standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s). The LMS MD shall have an auxiliary power source adapter that can operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s).<br />c. False Alarm Rates (FAR). The false alarm rate (FAR) is defined as the percentage of total detections where the detector alerts the operator when no underground object is present. The FAR associated with symmetric and asymmetric targets differ due to their inherit designs. The methodology for measurement is defined as the number of false alarms per 25 square meters.</p>
<p>Symmetric targets are items manufactured and characterized by fixed and known design standards and specification. Accordingly, symmetric targets with these fixed and known characteristics (sizes, shapes, functionalities, metallic signatures, etc.) tend to be more exploitable/detectable then ad hoc asymmetric designed targets. Symmetric targets are typically of an all-inclusive designed device (firing mechanism, detonator, and main explosive charge) common to military ordnance items (mines, grenades, projectiles etc.). The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 5 percent (T) and 3 percent (O) for symmetric targets.<br />Asymmetric threats or improvised explosive devices (IED) have no standard exploitable design characteristics. No design is exactly the same and quite often crudely assembled from separate components (main charge, initiation device, detonator, power supply, and circuitry) into a randomly designed explosive hazard. The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 10 percent (T) and 5 percent (O) for asymmetric targets.</p>
<p>d. The LMS MD shall have an "instant-on" start-up time of less than 90 seconds (T) and 60 seconds (O) from its pack stowed condition, to set-up and be ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation. The start-up time is defined as the time when the LMS MD is powered ON to the time it is ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation.</p>
<p>e. Operational Weight. In its operational configuration, the LMS MD shall weigh less than 9.0 lbs (T) and less than 5.0 lbs (O). When configured for operation, the system will include the wand, search head, external control unit, battery and headset, but not the carrying case, calibration equipment, spare power supplies or optional equipment.</p>
<p>f. Modular Design. The LMS MD shall have a modular design that allows for components to be interchangeable between detectors (T) and does not require recalibration afterward (O).&nbsp; <br />3. The Government is interested in receiving your insight on the aforementioned proposed acquisition. Interested sources that possess the technical capability and resources to fulfill the Government's requirements stated herein are invited to provide a Letter of Interest and a Capability Statement. Responses should include at a minimum:<br />a. Product literature, including a description of the system and, if available, validating information in the form of independent or government conducted testing supporting claims. If the system cannot meet one or more of the thresholds contained in this synopsis, explain the best capability of the system in that area. Include information of any capabilities or optional capabilities above and beyond the specification contained in this notification.<br />b. Pricing Information<br />c. Production and delivery capability<br />d. Capability to provide parts and repair support<br />e. Past performance information detailing any experience with hand-held mine detection systems in general and ground penetrating radar in particular<br />Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed more than (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Reponses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New.<br />Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector Response to Request for Information".<br />This sources-sought/Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.</p>
