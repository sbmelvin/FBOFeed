<DESC>This is a source sought for the design and fabrication of a digital CMOS IC for use in digital streak imagers.

Currently Bechtel Nevada Los Alamos Operations uses analog streak cameras in a VISAR (Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector) system.  We are currently in a research and development project to build and test a prototype digital streak imager.  

The objective is to “Best Value” subcontract the digital CMOS IC design and fabrication to a Subcontractor with experience in photodiode and CMOS imaging system products.  The Subcontractor shall design a CMOS ROIC (readout integrated circuit) attached to a photodiode array for this new Digital Streak System.  These packaged IC chips shall be delivered at the end of the final phase to Bechtel Nevada.  

1.0	Target Requirements

The target requirements are the minimum desired requirements for the project.  

(2 X 256) pixel array X 512 samples per pixel

100um x 100um pixel size

Arrangement of pixels allows for a coupling of 100um diameter core optical fiber with 140um outer diameter size to each pixel

Allow for adjustable gains on each of the two rows of pixels

5 ns integration time; 5 ns inter-frame rate (10 ns frame rate)

12-bit digital output, >11-bit dynamic range with one or more outputs where readout rate is sufficient to maintain dynamic range

System on chip design

2.0	Deliverables

Deliverables will be required at the end of each of the three phases of this project.

Phase 1 is concept design, schematics, preliminary layout, and modeling.  This phase will start when the contract is awarded until September 30, 2005.  At the end of this phase we will have a Preliminary Design Review.

The deliverable is a report sent to all parties attending the Preliminary Design Review two weeks prior to the review including:

Circuit simulation outputs

Preliminary IC Layouts (pixel cells, memory cells)
System block diagrams including a listing of already designed blocks vs. design from scratch blocks
Preliminary performance predictions
Organize Preliminary Design Review by September 30, 2005

Phase 2 is the IC layout designs, layout models, and simulations.  This phase will start October 1, 2005 and run for 6 months, pending funding and a satisfactory Preliminary Design Review.  A Final Design Review will take place at the end of Phase 2.

The deliverable is a report sent to all parties attending the Final Design Review two weeks prior to the review including:
Complete IC layouts
Parasitic extractions
Post layout simulations with parasitics
Final performance predictions including the requirements listed in section 3.1
Organize Final Design Review once Phase 2 is completed.

Phase 3 is the fabrication and packaging of the ICs and full functional test to verify IC chip meets or exceeds the target requirements.  The deliverables are the packaged IC chips, the corresponding data sheet, and final reports.  Upon delivery we will have a receipt inspection. This phase will start after the end of Phase 2 and run for 6 months pending funding and assuming we have a satisfactory Final Design Review.  An optional portion of Phase 3 is designing and building the imaging system.  

The deliverables include:
Minimum 8 packaged IC chips tested for functionality verification
The chip data/specification sheets

All interested parties shall submit product brochures, capability statements or other descriptive literature, which provides sufficient detail to enable preliminary functional evaluation.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has a need for programmatic support services of its information technology programs. This will include support for the Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS), Pipeline Information Processing Enforcement System (PIPES), Integrated Operator Compliance System (IOCS), Online Data Entry System (ODES), PHMSA-wide financial databases, and support for PHMSA’s regional and field offices.  The HMIS, PIPES, IOCS, and ODES are the primary sources of national data for the Federal, state, and local government agencies responsible for the safety of hazardous materials transportation.  Support of these systems includes data and database administration, statistical analysis through database manipulation, and generation of standard and specialized reports. The contractor will also be responsible for developing an acceptable transition plan to transition from the existing contract to this contract.
<p>
Due to recent legislation, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has split the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) into two new agencies, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA). The reorganization will be completed by early March, 2005.  The size and scope of the programmatic support services sought in this acquisition are comparable to that being provided under RSPA’s current programmatic support contract.  Current services are primarily for the support of RSPA’s Office of Hazardous Materials Safety, Office of Pipeline Safety, and offices that serve a support role in the agency.  These offices will remain with PHMSA. 
<p>
PHMSA regulates the transportation of hazardous materials by highway, rail, air, pipeline, and water.  PHMSA carries out its transportation safety responsibilities as set forth in the Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Law and the Federal Pipeline Safety Law.  Within PHMSA, the Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS) operates the Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS) and the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) operates the Pipeline Information Processing Enforcement System (PIPES), Integrated Operator Compliance System (IOCS), and Online Data Entry System (ODES) to support these missions.  The HMIS, PIPES, IOCS, and ODES are the primary sources of national data for the Federal, state, and local government agencies responsible for the safety of hazardous materials transportation.  These systems collect and distribute information on hazardous materials spills, pipeline annual and incident reporting data, and on regulatory activities.  These data management efforts are critical to providing immediate response to numerous inquiries from within PHMSA and DOT and various other Federal, state, and local government agencies; members of Congress; the news media; and the private sector.  Data and database administration, statistical analysis, and the provision of standard and specialized reports are critical activities of this highly visible system.
<p>
PHMSA utilizes various legacy applications to manage its financial and procurement activities.  Systems development and integration are critical activities to support these applications.
<p>
On June 10, 2003, the Department of Transportation’s Chief Information Office (CIO) issued an Action Memorandum requiring RSPA to transition its requirement for Information Technology (IT) Support Services to the Department.  RSPA did so.  Since then, several events have occurred that have affected the consolidation effort.  The DOT CIO has defined IT consolidation as a requirement for the DOT Headquarters facility. Next, recent budgetary impacts have constrained the Departmental CIO’s ability to rapidly transition DOT to a consolidated infrastructure.  RSPA and the DOT CIO determined that the LAN/WAN Management and Help Desk Support portion of the IT Support Services would remain part of the DOT Consolidated IT infrastructure.  The split of RSPA into PHMSA and RITA does not alter this determination. (NOTE: Please see the “Optional Services” section of the Statement of Work (SOW) which describes services we may require if consolidation is not complete when this contract commences.)  The programmatic activities described in the Statement of Work (Hazardous Materials Information System (HMIS), Pipeline Information Processing Enforcement System (PIPES), Online Data Entry System (ODES), and Integrated Operator Compliance System (IOCS)) and the application support activities (including financial applications such as PRISM, RAMIS, and others) are a separate requirement for which PHMSA is responsible.

<DESC>SOLICITATION FOR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER (CM) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, General Services Administration, 1500 E. Bannister Road, Room 2135, Kansas City, Missouri  64131-3088.  Project Control Number RMO25550.  Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about March 16, 2005.  No document charge or deposit is required.  Request list of those received RFP no later than ten days before submittals are due.  The contract will cover the States of MO, KS, NE, and IA, but will have a primary geographic area.  Firms will generally receive work in the primary area, but may receive work in other parts of the four state region.  The primary geographical area is the City of Kansas City, which includes the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA), the city of Columbia, MO, and the portion of the State of Missouri west of Columbia, the State of Nebraska and the State of Kansas.  Project involves:  Building construction projects having a construction cost less than $5,000,000.  CM services may include (1) Pre-Design Services (design programming, developing management plans, schedules, budgets, and studies); (2) Design Phase Services (design review, cost estimate review schedules, cost control); (3) Construction Phase Services (inspection to assure contract compliance, daily logs, progress reports, write and negotiate change proposals on behalf of the Government, process contractor invoices); (4) Post Construction Phase Services (converting red-lined as-built drawings to CAD drawings): and (5) other related services as required.  Typical projects include initial space alterations for tenant agencies, replacing/adding building system components (switchgear, roofs, boilers, chillers, HVAC equipment, and low voltage monitoring & Control systems such as fire alarm), and parking lot improvements.  The majority of the projects will have estimated construction costs in the range from $50,000 to $2,000,000.  Additional similar projects may be added to the contract if mutually acceptable to the Government and the CM.  The minimum contract amount to be awarded per year is $2,000.  The maximum amount payable under this contract shall not exceed $1,000,000 per year or any exercised option periods.  The term of the contract is one year.  However, at the option of the Government and if the CM contractor’s performance is satisfactory, the contract may be extended for up to four additional one-year option periods.  The successful CM contractor, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, shall not be eligible for award of a contract for A-E or construction services for these projects, nor serve as a subcontractor or consultant to any A-E or construction contractor for these projects.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Because of the critical role of the CM, the Government intends to use the “best value concept” in selecting a CM.  The “best value concept” is a method of evaluating price and other factors specified in the solicitation; with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance and other factors.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) contains the contract terms, scope of work and the proposal submittal requirements.  The RFP will be available o/a March 16, 2005.  Proposals shall be received in this office o/a April 19, 2005.  Specific date and time shall be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Technical factors and price will be considered.  Technical evaluation factors, in relative order of importance, are (1) Qualifications of Organization; (2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and (3) Management Plan.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors, however, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns (see numbered note 1).  Applicable NAICS Code is 236220 and the size standard is $28.5 million 

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.   It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address:  www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  


The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy with each offer.  Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance under Help. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items:  an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.

Any mandatory recalls of the kits provided under this contract and any other problems that require notification to the FDA must be resolved as required by the FDA regulations current at the time.  The contractor shall notify the contracting officer of any recall or FDA notification within two working days of the event.  1.3.2.  Except as provided herein, the reagents supplied throughout the term of this contract shall be identical to the reagents offered by the contractor and accepted by the Government at the time of the contract award.  If, during the course of this contract, the manufacturer plans to change, modify or improve its reagent, that product modification must be proposed in writing to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to its incorporation into the kits to be delivered.  The contractor's proposal must include documentation that demonstrates that the manufacturer has complied with all applicable FDA regulations, including those concerning the filing of a new 510k notice if such action and subsequent FDA clearance are warranted by the nature of the modification.  1.4.  Packaging. The materials provided must be in volumes and packaging that are convenient and applicable to the throughput of the military laboratories and should not result in the loss or unnecessary disposal of significant volumes of reagent.  The contractor will not be required to provide calibrators and control materials for the drug reagents.  (The military laboratories will separately obtain or provide calibrators and control materials to be used with the reagents.)  The materials must be provided with an instruction sheet that complies with all requirements of the FDA and includes data demonstrating specific performance characteristics, such as, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, cross reactivity, and safety precautions.  The instruction sheet(s) shall include procedures optimized for military drug testing laboratory operations as represented in these specifications and cutoffs as utilized by the DoD.  The Government will not develop procedures or optimize the performance of a kit for the contractor.  1.5.  Shelf life.  Minimum shelf life of any unopened component of the assay shall be at least 180 days from date of delivery at the drug-testing laboratory.  Once kit container seals are broken and the component opened, the shelf life must be at least 14 days.  Once diluted the material must have a shelf life of 24 hours.  2.  Testing and Quality Control Protocol.  The following testing and quality control protocol will be used for all military testing.  The reagents supplied must be adaptable to the calibration requirements and characteristics of the Roche (Modular "D" and "P") high-speed automated analyzer.  Verification of each calibration will be accomplished with a drug free control, a control at 75% of cutoff concentration, a control at 125% of cutoff concentration and a control at 200% of cutoff concentration.  An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free < 75% < cutoff < 125% < 200% controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens. The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in C.3 using this testing protocol.  3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF REAGENTS.  3.1.  Opiate (COD/MOR) Sensitivity. The initial immunoassay test cutoff concentration shall be 2,000 ng/mL of COD and/or MOR when using MOR as the calibrator.   The reagent shall identify specimens containing COD and/or MOR at or above the calibration cutoff concentration of 2,000 ng/ml. The assay shall identify as positive by the initial immunoassay test 95% of the specimens that contain 2,500 ng/mL or more of COD and/or MOR.  The sensitivity and specificity of the reagent for COD/MOR is such that no less than 85% of the presumptive positives shall be confirmed positive by GC/MS at the 2,000 ng/mL-confirmation cutoff for COD and at 4,000 ng/ml for MOR.  3.2.  Opiates (COD/MOR) Reproducibility.  An assay of 20 sequential aliquots of each of the following samples using the reagent must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration value of less than 7.5%: cutoff calibrator, control urine with concentration at 75% of cutoff and control urine with concentration at 125% of cutoff.  The coefficient of variation for calibrators and controls at these concentrations distributed throughout a testing batch must also be less than 10%.  A batch will consist of the samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the batch there must not be significant drift in control values.  3.3.  Drug Free Urine.  If so requested by one of the six DoD military drug screening laboratories, the contractor must provide 250 ml of drug free (for amphetamines (including designer amphetamines (MDMA, MDA and MDEA), LSD, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, THCCOOH, Benzoylecgonine, Cocaine, Barbiturates, PCP, 6-acetylmorphine, Opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit) to the requesting laboratory(s).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The following drug cutoffs (ng/mL) in urine specimens are currently used by the DoD for the initial immunoassay and GC/MS confirmation tests respectively: 11 Nor delta 9 THC carboxylic acid (THCCOOH) 50, 15; Cocaine metabolite (Benzoylecgonine) 150, 100; Opiates (Codeine/Morphine) 2000, Morphine 4000; Codeine 2000; 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) 10,10; Phencyclidine (PCP) 25, 25; Amphetamine/Methamphetamine (and designer amphetamines MDMA, MDA, MDEA) 500, 500; Barbiturates (secobarbital) 200, 200; Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 0.5, 0.2, and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (hydroxy-LSD) 1.0 and 1.0.  The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory request negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in 1-liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  3.4.  Opiates (COD/MOR) Low Control Specificity.

<DESC>Advanced Electro-Optical/Infrared Spectral Sensor Data Analysis Software Development Request for Information NASIC/DEMZ EO-IR Spectral Data Analysis Software Request for Information 1. PURPOSE:  This is a special notice requesting information to ascertain the capabilities of commercial industry, military contractors, and academia to develop/provide software and algorithms to satisfy high-technology intelligence data exploitation needs of the Advanced MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence) Research and Requirements Branch of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center.  The needs are in addition to the capabilities of traditional visual imagery analysis and specific areas of interest include: *	Exploiting data from multi-spectral and hyper-spectral EO-IR sensors. *	Analyzing EO-IR sensor data through algorithms/software for  identifying natural/man-made materials and targets. *	Employing Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) technologies including  signature exploitation in the EO-IR spectrum. *	Fusing data from various EO, IR, and RF sensors for better  identification performance with fewer discrepancies than any can provide individually. *	Interfacing with complex National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF)  and other formatted data. *	Interfacing EO-IR signature libraries containing target and material  entries. *	Verifying and validating EO-IR sensor data analysis algorithms. 2. NOTICE:  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information and market research for planning purposes only.   3. BACKGROUND:  One mission of DEMZ is to derive military intelligence (e.g.  identification/location of targets, materials, and threats) from any/all passive commercial/military EO-IR sensors.  The mission is enhanced by exploiting signatures (i.e. electromagnetic emissions and reflectance) from natural and man-made items of interest.  To support the mission in the past, complex algorithms have been developed and incrementally improved with each release of a DEMZ software product called COSMEC (Common Spectral MASINT Exploitation Capability).  Overall, COSMEC and related spectral MASINT resources directly support NASIC's mission to provide timely/integrated intelligence products to the warfighter and to the intelligence, operations, policy, and acquisition communities. 4. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Request for Information is to ascertain state-of-the-art and the corresponding capabilities of sources to provide subject software and contracted support to future DEMZ programs.  The scope of DEMZ programs includes but is not limited to, the development and utilization of exploitation tools for present and future EO-IR sensor data. 5.  RESPONSE DETAILS: Responses may be classified (up through Top Secret SCI) or unclassified.  For classified responses, companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operation Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of classified responses.  Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.  If the responding company has performed similar work in the past for the U.S.  government, then include the previous government contract number.  Company responses should include a one-page cover letter, a presentation (in text or slide format) of up to 50 pages that describes the company's capabilities to address the needs in this RFI, and any applicable résumé's. Companies are not limited to a single response.  Although submissions will be received at any time within one year, primary submissions are due within 30 days of this announcement and may be made by email (if unclassified) or mailing your response on a floppy disk (or compact disc) to the government POC as follows: Capt James Hartmetz NASIC/XPA 4180 Watson Way WPAFB, OH 45433-5648 (937) 522-2974 james.hartmetz@wpafb.af.mil Personnel hand-carrying classified responses should contact the government point of contact to coordinate delivery. 6. CONCLUSION:  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information the "art of the possible" from commercial industry, military contractors, and academia with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for DEMZ.   Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected form any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability, requirements approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 7.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Ing. Juan Carlos Nevarez Hernandez, Departamento de Licitaciones y Obras, Comision Estatal de Servicios Publicos de Tijuana, Via Rapida Poniente No. 3, Col. Fortin de las Flores, Tercera Etapa del Rio Tijuana, Tijuana, B.C., Mexico, Tel and Fax: (664) 686 0473, 686 0759 and 686 0545. The Comision Estatal de Servicios Publicos de Tijuana (CESPT) (the “Grantee”) invites submission of proposals (the “Proposal”) from interested parties which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform a feasibility study for the modernization of the Tijuana water and waste system.

The objective of feasibility study is to provide technical and economic analysis to CESPT in its efforts to modernize the Tijuana water and waste system. In 2003, CESPT embarked on a vision to reform its water and waste system infrastructure.  CESPT’s master plan is focused on providing an integrated strategy of ensuring public health, quality of life, and environmental protection.  The plan was financed through grants from the U.S. EPA and the North American Development Bank and is now in the stage of specific project development; the plan identified the following projects, which are the subject of the proposed feasibility study:

1. Sludge management:  The objective of this project is to develop uses and a market for residual waste produced in the four major wastewater treatment plants in Tijuana.  This type of activity is commonly practiced in the U.S. and elsewhere, utilizing residual waste for fertilizers, organic and industrial farming, and other safe and efficient means of sludge management.

2. Popotla Wastewater Treatment Plant:  The objective of this project is to establish a new wastewater treatment plant to cover the growing treatment needs of the Popotla region.  In addition, this plant will focus on reducing untreated discharges into the Pacific Ocean that may affect the State of California’s coastline.

3. Telemetry system:  The 2003 Master Plan calls for incorporation of telemetry systems for both potable water and wastewater systems as a requirement to monitor, control and manage the expanded distribution and collection systems, and especially in light of the hilly and mountainous topography of the project area.

CESPT is seeking proposals for a feasibility study to perform engineering studies focusing on the following components: 1) wastewater treatment (sewage) sludge management, 2) design for the proposed Popotla Wastewater Treatment Plant, and 3) development of an effective telemetry system for their potable and wastewater treatment systems.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The large business firm selected for this contract will be r equired to submit a detailed subcontracting plan at a later date.  If the selected firm submits a plan with less than the Corps recommended goals, it must subm it, in writing, an acceptable rationale why the recommended goals cannot be met, which rationale indicates that at the time the selected firm submitted its SF330 there was genuine belief that the goals would be virtually met and planning proceeded accordin gly.  The Corps will negotiate the goals if it deems appropriate, and will vacate the selection if it deems the firm was disingenuous in representing itself as committed to high small business subcontracting goals at the outset.  A detailed plan is not req uired to be submitted with the SF 330; however, the plans to do so should be specified in Block H of the SF 330.  To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) is seeking offers to provide support to Principal Investigators (PIs) in the Office of Clinical Research (OCR) and Division of Intramural Research (DIR) at the  NIEHS for various types of clinical research studies and interventional clinical trials.  Examples of observational studies to be covered by this contract are case report and case series, case-control, cross-sectional, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies.  Interventional studies to be covered by this contract are: 1) efficacy trials of new treatments, new combinations of drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy; 2) prevention trials using various therapies, diet and lifestyle changes, vitamins, minerals, and methods to minimize potentially toxic exposures; 3) diagnostic trials aimed at developing better tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition;  and 4) quality of life trials to explore ways to improve comfort or quality of life of individuals with a certain disease or lifestyle by modifying risk factors.  Observational and interventional clinical research involves carrying out many complex study tasks, all of which will be supported by this contract.  The design and implementation of each clinical research projects will be the responsibility of the Task Leader initiating the study, but advice may be sought from the NIEHS Project Officers, Contractor or a contracted panel of experts.  The extent of the Contractor's involvement with any given study may vary depending on the study design and support available in-house, through collaborators or other contracts.  For example, the Contractor might carry out only the surveillance and recruitment phase of a study, or only develop and administer study questionnaires.  Alternatively, the Contractor might only be involved in the treatment or sample collection phase of a study.  Some studies will require medical support for the initial subject evaluation, diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up care and this will involve providing medical personnel and facilities and/or interacting with medical personnel at other facilities including physician’s practices, clinics, and hospitals.  The medical institutions may be local or distant, and thus require travel by Contract personnel and/or study participants.  The Contractor might be required to coordinate activities with various reference laboratories, medical clinics or other institutions, and collaborators with NIEHS personnel.  Finally, all studies and/or tasks supported by this contract will be conducted according to all relevant federal guidelines and regulations.  Therefore, the Contractor will have knowledge and experience of all relevant guidelines and regulations for using human beings in research studies, e.g. 45 CFR 46 or the DHHS Common Rule, and those regulations for patient confidentiality such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 (HIPAA).  It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded with a base period of performance of four years with options to extend the period of performance up to a total of ten years.  Also, the solicitation will include, along with other evaluation criteria, a mandatory qualification criteria that must be met that is geographic restriction that the offeror(s) shall for the duration of the period of performance have existing or demonstrate ability to establish offices, equipment and technical facilities, including laboratory facilities within 30 minutes driving time of the NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  Established offices and facilities must occur within 60 days of contract award.  Frequent discussions and consultations with NIEHS Project Officer necessitate that the Contractor be in close proximity to minimize the expense to the Government and increase communications.  The anticipated release date of the solicitation is sometime during the 2nd and 3rd week of January 2005.  The NAICS code is 541710.  See Numbered Note 26.

This modification is made to add Amendment 1.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide clarifications and answers to questions received from interested parties.  The hour and date specified for receipt of offers is not extended.

The information from pages 2 - 4 are provided below.

Question 1.	“Paragraphs l and p of the organizational evaluation criteria, RFP pages 70-71, are duplicates.  However no criteria are given regarding biostatistical experience.  May we assume that one of these paragraphs should represent criteria on biostatistical experience?”

Answer:	Paragraph l. on RFP page 70 and paragraph p. beginning on page 70 and continuing on page 71 are duplicates; therefore, paragraph p. is deleted in its entirety.  The 30 points associated with paragraph p. are redistributed as follows:

			On RFP page 69:

			Paragraph g. - points for this criteria are increased by 5 from 30 to 35.

			Paragraph h. - points for this criteria are increased by 5 from 30 to 35.  Also, the words “(assuming general content is identified by a NIEHS PI)” are deleted.

			Paragraph i. - points for this criteria are increased by 10 from 20 to 30.

			On RFP page 70:

			Paragraph n. - points for this criteria are increased by 5 from 20 to 25.

			Paragraph o. - points for this criteria are increased by 5 from 20 to 25.

		Biostatistical experience will be evaluated against the criteria in paragraph b. under STAFF: QUALIFICATION OF KEY AND OTHER PERSONNEL on RFP page 71 and the Statement of Work, Attachment 1.

Question 2.	“Please provide additional guidance for estimating other direct costs (ODCs) for the overall contract (as opposed to the model study).  If each offeror estimates ODCs based on their own assumptions about the studies to be conducted over the 10-year period, how will the Government compare the cost estimates?  Also, estimating ODCs for this period of time will result in lengthy business proposals detailing estimated costs (e.g., patient recruitment costs, treatment costs, laboratory analyses, setting up field offices) for numerous studies for the 10-year period.  For purposes of the bid, could the Government provide a standard amount (e.g., $100,000 per year) that each offeror should include as ODC costs for the overall contract?”

Answer:	It is not possible to completely determine in advance the clinical research support needs, or the nature and number of studies to be conducted over the anticipated period of performance of ten years.  Nor is it possible to accurately include all work assignments, tasks, and issues that need to be addressed.  In year 1, you may consider costs for establishing a facility in the RTP area, initial start-up equipment, e.g., computers, refrigerators, freezers, telephones, etc.  Also, consider costs for starting two new major studies each year of the ten years and that an average study will last three years.  Between new and ongoing studies, you may estimate the costs for 2, 4, and 6 major studies in years 1, 2, and 3, and then you may estimate providing support for 6 major studies each year for years 4 through 10.  Similarly, the level of effort for various personnel will increase incrementally over the first three years and then plateau as the steady state level of the total studies is reached.  Both clinical observational studies and clinical trials can require diagnoses.  You may consider estimates for diagnostic fees for 600 patients in year 1, 900 patients in year 2, and 1,200 patients in years 3 through 10.  Additionally, we have provided guidance for estimating refrigerator and freezer requirements and maintenance and repair thereof on pages 8 and 9 of the Statement of Work, Attachment 1 to the RFP.  Guidance for estimating travel costs is provided on pages 12 and 13 of the Statement of Work.  An estimate of the level of effort broken down by year and labor category is provided in Attachment 2 of the RFP.

		Please refer to paragraph a. GENERAL under SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD, RFP page 63, where it states that costs are important factors for consideration in award decisions; however, technical factors are paramount.

Question 3.	“On page 36 of the RFP, the ‘important Note to Offerors’ states that paragraphs 9 through 14 should be addressed in the technical proposal.

			3.a	Paragraph 14 on page 39 is not relevant to human subject risk.  Was the reference to ‘paragraphs 9 through 13'?

			3.b	Under which evaluation criteria will points be assigned to the discussions required by the ‘Important Note to Offerors’ on page 36, and by Section M.b (Human Subject Evaluation)?”

Answer:	First, on RFP page 36, paragraph (1) beginning with “Once you reach.....” is corrected to read as paragraph (10).  

		Now, to answer 3.a. - No, the reference is not to paragraphs (9) through (14).  The reference should be to paragraphs (9) and (10); therefore, the “Important Note to Offerors” is corrected to read as follows:

		“IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: Paragraphs (9) and (10) shall be addressed in a SEPARATE SECTION of the Technical Proposal entitled, ‘HUMAN SUBJECTS.’”

		Now, to answer 3.b. - Offeror’s proposals regarding human subjects will be evaluated according to paragraph b. entitled HUMAN SUBJECT EVALUATION beginning on RFP page 63.  Human subject evaluation will be  treated as a stand alone factor and the evaluation thereof will be independent of the technical evaluation.

Question 4.	“On page 72 of the RFP, the description of the qualifications of the Study Monitor/Clinical Research Associate are those of the Laboratory Technician.  Can we assume the correct qualification are those shown in item 2 on page 23 of the SOW?”

Answer:	Yes, you are correct.  Paragraph f. on RFP page 72 is corrected to read:

		“f.	Study Monitor/Clinical Research Associate (CRA) - The Study Monitor/CRAs should work closely with the Study Managers and contract personnel to oversee the progress and conduct of clinical research study and ensure the scientific integrity of the data collected.  CRAs should be responsible for reviewing data to ensure the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects are maintained.  Study Monitors/CRAs should have at a minimum, a B.S. or B.A. degree, or the equivalent in a health care or science background (e.g., nurse, medical technologist, or physical therapist) and at least 2 years of CRA experience.”

Question 5.	“In paragraph two on page 22 of the SOW, it states that “4 clinical research studies will be initiated during year 1.”  However, on page 25, it states that the level of effort is based on starting 2 studies each year.  Please clarify the number of studies to be started in year 1.”

Answer:	Two studies will be initiated during year 1; therefore, the number “4" in the 4th line of the 2nd paragraph on page 22 of the Statement of Work, Attachment 1, is corrected to read “2.”

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to perform preclinical studies of potential new therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of diabetic complications.  A clinical evaluation is not desired at this time.  

The Contractor will work closely with NIDDK project staff and external scientific consultants in designing protocols appropriate for the individual requirements of these compounds. The Contractor shall prepare draft protocols with the final design to be agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall conduct studies of potential new therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes as agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall prepare final study reports in consultation with the Project Officer for submission as Investigational New Drug applications (IND) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for support of efficacy and /or mechanism of action of the potential new therapeutic.  

A contract has not been awarded previously for these services.

The Type 1 Diabetes - Rapid Access to Intervention Development (T1D-RAID) program is designed to assist translation from the research bench to the clinic of novel therapeutic interventions for Type 1 diabetes and its complications. These potential interventions can be either synthetic, natural product, or biologic.  
T1D-RAID is not a grant mechanism. Approved requests to T1D-RAID gain access to the drug development contract resources of the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI DTP).  The output of the use of these resources is provided to the originating investigator, and may include GMP synthesized material, formulation research, pharmacological methods, or IND-directed toxicology, for support of an investigator-held IND application and clinical trials. T1D-RAID does not sponsor clinical trials; it sponsors the work needed to get ready to do clinical trials.

<CONTACT>Capt Michael T. Pope,937-255-8022
<DESC>Sources Sought for Static Dissipater Additive The Air Force Petroleum Office, Weapon Systems Support Branch at Wright- Patterson AFB is seeking potential sources of Static Dissipater Additive (SDA) for military grade jet fuel (JP-8).  There is currently no impending requirement for the Additive, only a necessity to establish a Qualified Products List.  The Weapon Systems Support Branch of the Air Force Petroleum Office (AFPET) is seeking to qualify additional sources of an SDA for JP-8.   Each potential SDA will be tested for qualification.  Once qualification testing has been passed, the additive will be placed on a qualified product list (QPL) for approved SDA sources for use with JP-8.  Potential sources must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for the qualification process: 	Must have an additive which has already been fully developed and is ready for testing; the Government does not intend to support any development effort for new additives. 	If qualified, the vendor must be able to begin full production immediately. 	The additive must be able to increase the electrical conductivity of non-additized JP-8 (at the refinery) from 0-50 ps/m to 150-450 ps/m. 	Potential vendors must be willing to send background information on their SDA such as MSDS, complete chemical compound make-up, and the results of any vendor testing upon request to the AFPET The qualification process is expected to begin in Nov 2005.  Response to this notice is required within 30 days after posting date.  Please respond to: Steven Shaeffer 2430 C St, Bldg 70 Area B WPAFB, OH 45433-7632 Steven.shaeffer@wpafb.af.mil 937-255-8022 There will be no resultant request for purchase based on this sources sought announcement.

<DESC>This FedBizOps announcement is our notice that TRICARE Regions 6, 7&8 (formerly Southwest & Central) which includes all Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Ida ho, Oklahoma, New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming are initiating the standardization process for the pharmaceuticals as indicated by the listed generic codes below.     This is a Sources Sought Notice only, and samples are not being requested at this time.  The intent of this standardization is to establish a regionally preferred source(s) and to achieve volume discounts of selected products for regional MTFs in TRICARE R egions 6, 7&8.  In exchange for becoming a preferred source for TRICARE Regions 6, 7&8, the Government requests additional price considerations for these products.  Other TRICARE Regions may elect to join after award, and additional price consideration wil l be requested at that time.     Products.  HYDROXYZINE HCL:  Generic code 013943, 25 mg, has an estimated annual usage of 140 bottles in 100 tabs (14,000), 383 bottles in 500 tabs (191,500), 828 bottles in 1000 tabs (82,800).

Each vendor must not only meet all FDA requirements related to pharmaceuticals, medications, and vaccines but also meet or demonstrate compliance with the base criterion for this product line.  These criterion include but are not limited to the following:  (1) Clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug in appropriate populations.  (2)  Therapeutic advantages and disadvantages relative to accepted therapy.  (3)  Cost-effectiveness relative to accepted therapy.  (4)  Clinica l support and education programs to each MTF.  (5)  Customer support in the form of a sales representative for each MTF within TRICARE Regions 6, 7& 8.  (6)  Unique NDC for each product.  (7)  Bar code labeling with NDC.  (8) Existing Federal Supply Schedu le (FSS) contract for each product and/or a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for providing reliable distribution through our DoD Pharmacy Prime Vendors (Reg 6- Bergen; Reg 7&8- Cardinal and Dakota Drug) for all TRICARE Region 6, 7&8 facilities.  ( 9)  Quarterly utilization data collection support to the Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  (10) A company returns policy.   Selection.  A Clinical Product Team (CPT) will evaluate this product line.  CPTs are composed of healthcare providers who have expertise and knowledge of the products and will review products and literature submitted.  TRICARE Regions 6, 7&8 deem the CPT m embers to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine and recommend which products are acceptable.  The CPT recommendation can be based on literature review, presentation, demonstration, and physical or clinical evaluation.  Recommendat ions by the CPT will be at the sole discretion of the experts selected to review any offering.  The drug(s) may or may not be listed on drug plan formularies, and recommendations may be deferred pending further information.    Pricing.  Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) can be exercised on the package size or bulk quantities deemed most advantageous to the Government.  Price is the most important factor, and items may be awarded as an aggregate.  Vendors are required to propo se an incentive price in their submittals for each line item listed to be considered for award.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION

There is a pressing need to support democratization and to increase its credibility in Yemen.  Democratic governance is essential to both the economic growth that Yemen desperately needs and to managing the conflicts that threaten to destabilize its internal equilibrium.  It is therefore imperative for the USG to prioritize activities to encourage Yemen’s movement towards increased democracy and governance by strengthening representative institutions and the capacity and roles of their reform-minded members, and supporting more representative participation and a more representative environment.

The Democracy and Governance Special Objective (DG SpO) (Expanded Democracy and Governance in Yemen,) amends the USAID/Yemen Interim Strategy (May 5, 2003 - September 30, 2006) that was approved on May 5, 2003.  The DG SpO includes two Intermediate Results:  IR 1.0, (Representative Institutions Strengthened,) and, IR 2.0, (Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported.) 

IR 1.0, (Representative Institutions Strengthened,) corresponds to USAID/Yemen’s core DG activities that will address key development challenges in the DG sector and that directly support other elements of the USAID development program in Yemen.  Activities under IR 1.0 will focus on the roles, capacity, processes and interrelationships among members of parliament, local councils, line ministries and community organizations and will include the allocation and oversight of funds in the national and local fiscal process.

IR 2.0, (Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported,) provides a mechanism for USAID/Yemen, if requested, to address targets of opportunity jointly agreed to by Embassy/Sanaa and USAID/Yemen, that are funded by bilateral ESF allocations to USAID/Yemen, and are cleared by the USAID Bureau for Asia and the Near East (ANE). 

The DG SpO will maintain the cross-cutting theme of special attention to the needs and empowerment of women that is a key objective throughout the USAID Interim Strategy for Yemen.

<DESC>REQUEST for QUALIFICATIONS
TRUCKEE OFFICE DESIGN


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The United States Forest Service seeks Architectural-Engineering (A&E) Professional Services for the sustainable design of a new Truckee Ranger District Office, Truckee, California.  The development of the new Truckee Public Service Center will have this office building and a future Visitor Center as its cornerstone.  The overall design principles will consider the Forest Service’s “Built Environment Image Guide” (BEIG) and reflect the Agency’s values and principles of land stewardship, conservation, and public service.   The construction contract is currently planned for advertisement in March of 2006.

The successful A&E firm is to demonstrate the values of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, sustainability and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to the Agency’s values. The facility will meet Federal Energy Goals, security requirements and current codes governing the design.  The Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) is a consultation resource for the government to insure that suitable and appropriate energy conservation measures are proposed and implemented by the design team.  The Estimated Construction Cost range of the approximately 10,000 SF building project is $2 million to $3 million.  

In addition, the A&E firm is responsible for achieving certification that the building meets a minimum standard of Silver as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™), green building rating system.  To meet these standards, the design team must be organized to work together on a cross-disciplinary basis and analyze the project globally to incorporate a cross section of LEED™ categories.  It should have demonstrable expertise and experience with design strategies and techniques for energy efficiency and sustainable design practices that meet first cost and life-cycle economic criteria.  This expertise can be demonstrated by previously documented projects and by partnering with recognized energy and sustainable design experts.  The consideration for energy efficiency and environmental quality should begin at the earliest stages of planning and follow through construction and operation.  There should be scheduled review of the energy and environmental strategies, for both the building and the site, throughout the design process.  

The design team should demonstrate expertise and experience in the sustainable design of green buildings, including, but not limited to:

1.	Cost-benefit analysis of energy-efficient design strategies for all major systems and components, e.g., lighting, HVAC, building envelope and integrated building design
2.	Orientation, thermal mass, & shading, fenestration
3.	Energy modeling and simulation tools, e.g., DOE-2, EnergyPlus, Energy 10
4.	Daylighting analysis and simulation
5.	Electrical lighting, design and control and integration with daylighting
6.	Energy-management control systems
7.	Commissioning of energy systems following ASHRAE Guideline 1, "Guide for Commissioning of HVAC Systems", 1996
8.	Indoor air quality
9.	Consideration for efficient operation and maintenance of energy systems
10.	Renewable energy systems
11.	Documentation of design intent for energy systems performance
12.	LEED™ experience, Savings by Design incentive program

The proposed building should be designed to use at least 30% less energy than the 2005 Title 24 baseline building as defined in LEED™, without sacrificing any performance in the comfort, habitability and health of the occupants.  The goal is to achieve the highest LEED™ standard considering life cycle and budgetary constraints.

The scope of work may include, but is not limited to, the following: 
•	Complete architectural and engineering design; including: estimating, acoustic design, lighting, interior design, landscaping, etc.; 
•	Survey of the existing conditions; detailed scope verification; 
•	Preparation of specifications, CADD drawings, and construction documents; 
•	Value engineering; cost analysis;
•	Post construction contract services (PCCS); systems commissioning;
•	Record drawings and construction phase A&E inspection services; 
•	Other related services to provide for a completely functional and sustainable facility;
•	Achieving the highest LEED™ rating for the project. 
•	Analysis of future Visitor Center concept and office expandability.

The construction contract is to be procured through a “best value” source selection process and will incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the budget limitations.  Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, release 2002 or later. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in the latest MSOffice edition available at the time of contract award.

<SUBJECT>--Modularization of the 1st  Cavalry Division and to Convert to Army Battle Command System (ABCS) 6.4 configuration.
<DESC>The Tactical Operations Centers/Air and Missile Defense Command and Control Systems (TOCS/AMDCCS) Project Office has been directed by the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) to immediately modularize the 1st Cavalry Division and convert to Army Battle  Command System (ABCS) 6.4 configuration.  To accomplish this directive, it is necessary to acquire services and materials to fabricate, integrate, test, train, and deliver twenty-six Command Post Platforms (CPPs) for the 1st Cavalry Division, to procure f ifty-one Command Center Systems (CCS), and to configure 25 Battalion (BN) sets for Modularity Conversion.  The 1st Cavalry Division will be returning from Iraq in Apr 05 and are required to be RESET, realigned into a Modular configuration, and TOCs for Uni t of Actions (UAs) and Unit of Employment (UE) echelon converted to CPPs.  Under the current schedule the first UA unit must be fully integrated and net trained prior to hand-off to 1st Cavalry Division by Oct 05.  Upon their return, the 1st Cavalry Divisi on will immediately be RESET by Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) at Ft. Hood, TX.  Upon the completion of RESET activities, modularity conversion/cross-leveling and realignment of 1st Cavalry Division BN assets will be conducted at the same location by Northrop  Grumman Mission Systems (NGMS).  This effort will ensure existing 1st Cavalry Division assets are compatible and interoperable with the new CPPs at UA and UE echelons.  Additionally, new CPPs and CCS from NGMS will be required for the 1st Cavalry Division  UA and UE units.  This effort will ensure expedited fabrication and integration of CPPs and CCS(s) in support of current Army plans for deployments of units to Iraq.  It is anticipated that this acquisition will be acquired through the issuance of a lette r contract modification to existing Contract W31P4Q-04-C-0159 with NGMS, 1800 Glenn Curtiss Drive, Carson, CA, 90746-2800.  The anticipated contract type will be Fixed-Price-Incentive. This acquisition will provide for expedited fabrication and integration  of CPPs, CCS, and the re-configuration of existing 1st Cavalry Division shelters to ABCS 6.4 in support of current Army plans for deployments of units to Iraq, Afghanistan, or other hostile area.  The total estimated cost of this procurement is $48,797,87 8.  The estimated contract period of performance for this effort will be 18 months.

<SUBJECT>--Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR)
<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) at Rock Island will begin using the Past Performance Information Retrieval System-Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) on selected acquisitions to evaluate the past performance records of offero rs.  Applicable acquisitions shall contain PPIRS-SR notification provisions, which shall apply in conjunction with any other stated evaluation consideration. PPIRS-SR will collect contractor performance quality and delivery data on contracts from the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Annex Puget Sound (Navy), Warner Robbins Air Force Base, TACOM at Rock Island (Army), and Defense Supply Center in Richmond (Def ense Logistic Agency). The objective of PPIRS-SR is to collect quantifiable delivery and quality information from existing systems and use that data to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class or Service (FSC).  Contractors will be assigned a color that depic ts their past performance for quality and receive a numeric indicator that represents their on-time delivery performance. Source selection officials may consider this information during the contract award process. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR to view their current and pending classifications. Pending classifications, will be held in a review status for 30 days to allow for contractor review.  The database will be updated once a month. PPIRS-SR allows c ontactors an opportunity to challenge any quality/delivery performance record. It is the contractors responsibility to review the data in PPIRS-SR and make any appropriate challenges to that data.  To learn more about PPIRS-SR, register your firm in PPIRS -SR, review your past performance data (Each contractor can register to see what data PPIRS-SR contains.) and to submit any challenges go to the following website: http://www.ppirs.gov/.

An acceptable verification will have analytical readings for the drug free < 75% < cutoff < 125% < 200% controls. Open and blind quality control urine will be distributed throughout a test batch and will make up about 10% of the number of total specimens. The reagent must meet the performance criteria outlined in C.3 using this testing protocol.  3.  CHARACTERISTICS OF REAGENTS.  3.1.  THC-COOH  Sensitivity. The initial immunoassay test cutoff concentration shall be 50 ng/mL of THC-COOH.   The reagent shall identify specimens containing THC-COOH at or above the cutoff concentration. The assay shall identify as positive by the initial immunoassay test 95% of the specimens that contain 62.5 ng/mL or more of THC-COOH.  The sensitivity and specificity of the reagent for THC-COOH is such that no less than 85% of the presumptive positives shall be confirmed positive by GC/MS at the 15 ng/mL-confirmation cutoff for THC-COOH. Recognizing that physiologic urine specimens from THC drug use may contain other marijuana metabolites, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay should maximize the antibody cross-reactivity to these cannabinoids to detect THC-COOH when present at a concentration of 15 ng/ml in actual marijuana drug abuse urine samples.  3.2 THC-COOH Reproducibility.  An assay of 20 sequential aliquots of each of the following samples using the reagent must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration value of less than 7.5%: cutoff calibrator, control urine with concentration at 75% of cutoff and control urine with concentration at 125% of cutoff.  The coefficient of variation for calibrators and controls at these concentrations distributed throughout a testing batch must also be less than 10%.  A batch will consist of the samples tested between verifications of calibration.  Throughout the batch there must not be significant drift in control values.
3.3.  Drug Free Urine.  If so requested by one of the six DoD military drug screening laboratories, the contractor must provide 250 ml of drug free (for amphetamines (including designer amphetamines (MDMA, MDA and MDEA), LSD, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD, THCCOOH, Benzoylecgonine, Cocaine, Barbiturates, PCP, 6-acetylmorphine, Opiates, and must also contain less than 20 ng/mL of benzodiazepines) urine with each reagent kit order (equivalent to 2,000 tests/reagent kit) to the requesting laboratory(s).  The drug free urine provided with the reagent must have a GC/MS drug concentration less than the limit of quantitation for the analyte methodologies.  In addition, immunoassay of the drug free urine should have semi-quantitative concentration readings equivalent to or less than those recorded for drug controls at 20% of the DoD immunoassay cutoff concentrations.  The following drug cutoffs (ng/mL) in urine specimens are currently used by the DoD for the initial immunoassay and GC/MS confirmation tests respectively: 11 Nor delta 9 THC carboxylic acid (THCCOOH) 50, 15; Cocaine metabolite (Benzoylecgonine) 150, 100; Opiates (Codeine/Morphine) 2000, Morphine 4000; Codeine 2000; 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM) 10,10; Phencyclidine (PCP) 25, 25; Amphetamine/Methamphetamine (and designer amphetamines MDMA, MDA, MDEA) 500, 500; Barbiturates (secobarbital) 200, 200; Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) 0.5, 0.2, and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (hydroxy-LSD) 1.0 and 1.0.The negative urine should not be sent automatically.  If a laboratory request negative urine, it may be shipped with the monthly reagent delivery and supplied in 1-liter volume containers.  The military laboratories cannot redeem or exchange unused allocations of negative urine accrued by reagent purchase for additional reagents or other supplies from the vendor.  3.4. THC-COOH Low Control Specificity.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open low THC-COOH quality control quality control samples at 37.5 ng/ml must produce negative results in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis.  3.5  THC-COOH High Control Specificity.  A minimum of 95 percent of the open positive THC-COOH quality control samples at 62.5 ng/ml must be identified as positive in each analytical run and as calculated on a weekly basis. 
 3.6 Coefficient of Variance.  An assay of 20 sequential controls containing drug at 200% of the immunoscreen cutoff concentration, at the immunoscreen cutoff concentration, and 75% of immunoscreen cutoff concentration must have a coefficient of variation of the mean concentration reading less than 7.5%.  3.7. Cross-reactivity.  Each immunological reagent shall be checked for cross reactivity to drugs, chemicals, or metabolites that might be expected to produce a positive response.  The immunological reagent shall be checked for cross-reactivity to each drug/metabolite listed in C.1.2.  The THC-COOH reagent must not give a positive assay result for any of the drug/metabolites listed from any of the other six drug classes when they are in concentrations greater than 1 mg/mL or the solubility limit of the drug in urine, whichever is less.  Recognizing that physiologic urine specimens from THC drug use may contain other marijuana metabolites, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay should maximize the antibody cross-reactivity to these cannabinoids to detect THC-COOH when present at a concentration of 15 ng/ml in actual marijuana drug abuse urine samples.  4.  The Quality Assurance Program of the Manufacturing Process Must Include the Following Elements.  Documentation of Current Certification compliance with ISO 9000 Standards or documentation of compliance with Sections 4.1 through 4.5.6.  4.1  Chemicals and Reagents.  4.1.1.

Methods may include, but are not limited to, the determination of melting points, and GC/MS, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and spectrophotometric measurements.  4.1.2.  Stability.  The kit and each kit component must be shown to be stable and at the correct concentration over the period of use of the kit.  Components, which are homogeneous solutions, must not deteriorate throughout the period of use of the kit (from date of preparation to date of expiration).  4.2  Manufacturers Equipment.  4.2.1  Preventative maintenance.  Routine preventative maintenance procedures, periodic calibration, and any unscheduled maintenance must be fully documented and in accord with recommendations of the manufacturer of the equipment.  4.2.2.  Calibration and operational checks.  All instruments that are used to check a physical parameter of a solution or material must be calibrated and have documentation available to demonstrate that all required operational checks have been completed.  This includes gamma counters, pH meters, spectrometers, micropipettes, etc.  4.2.3.  Temperature checks.  Water baths, refrigerators, freezers, and other equipment, which maintain a given temperature, must be periodically validated for accuracy and routinely verified for correct settings.  4.2.4.  Glassware and other reusable laboratory supplies.  Appropriate procedures for cleaning and inspecting glassware and other reusable materials must be established and compliance documented.  4.3.  Labeled Drug Molecule.  4.3.1.  Authenticity.  The prepared (labeled) drug molecule must be verified to be authentic and its purity established.  4.3.2.  Stability.  The labeled drug must be documented to be stable to the expiration date and the immunoassay must meet all contract specifications to the end of expiration date (which is 180 days minimum).  4.4.  Antibody specificity/cross reactivity.
4.4.1 Characteristics.  Antibody specificity must be verified for each lot and the specificity reevaluated at routine intervals to ensure uniformity and quality of preparations.  The testing reagent must detect 95% of all specimens containing the screening metabolites at concentrations equal to or greater than 125% of the cutoff concentration of the initial test.  The testing reagent must be specific for the initial test cutoff metabolite such that no less than 85% of the specimens identified as positive will confirm positive for the metabolite by GC/MS at the GC/MS confirmation cutoff cited in C.1.2.  Chemical compounds that may reasonably cross react with the antibody must be tested to characterize antibody specificity.  These will include biochemical materials produced normally in the human body (this may be evaluated by testing numbers of specimens of normal human urine).  4.5.  Immunoassays.  4.5.1.  Technical performance.  Performance of each lot of kits must be verified.  The verification must establish, as a minimum, the appropriate response to the target molecule and that all other parameters as specified in the contract are met.  4.5.2.  Stability.  The performance parameters involved in the testing procedures must be verified and documented to be consistent throughout the shelf life of the kit.  4.5.3.  Manufacturer's production manual.  Procedures and criteria required to validate all components (and materials) employed during the manufacture of the reagents in the test kits and the operation of the completed kit over the entire period of shelf-life of the kit must be described in detail.  All steps of each quality control procedure shall be described thoroughly.   4.5.4.  Records.  The production and quality assurance records generated by each procedure performed above must be maintained in a systematic fashion to permit the verification of completion of all production parameters and shall be available for inspection during the term of the contract.  4.5.5.  Corrective action.  When a specified quality control parameter is found to be out of control limits, the action taken to ensure correction for existing kits (i.e., notification) must be documented and action taken to ensure that the deficiency does not reoccur and all records must be retained.  The Contracting Officer must be notified within 2 working days of any deficiencies in existing kits and of all corrective actions.  The FDA must be notified according to its regulations.  4.5.6.  Lot numbers.  Lot numbers must be used to identify reagents and other preparations to allow tracking of all immunoassay components.  The procedures used to assign unique lot numbers for each solution or reagent must be described.  A single lot number for a kit will suffice if all materials used in that lot number can be tracked to identify the materials and procedures used in the preparation of that kit.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number NFFK-65-sks is issued as a request for quotation and is solicited under full and open competition. The NAICS Code is 114111. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Sustainable Fisheries (OSF), has a statutory responsibility to manage the marine fisheries and resources in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in compliance with other relevant Federal laws including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act.

The NOAA/NMFS/OSF, Fisheries Management Program plans to develop a new way to measure program performance, using an index that at this stage we are calling the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI).  The goal for the measure is that it allows us to demonstrate incremental changes in fishery management performance that is not captured currently.

Specific services to be provided include:

(1)	Identify a set of stocks that will be tracked for the FSSI.  This will be done by asking the NMFS regional offices to make a list of the "top 25" stocks in these regions in order of importance as the best benchmarks for the Program’s performance.  This task will be completed based on discussions with, and under the direction of, Sustainable Fisheries (SF) staff.  Tasking memoranda for NMFS Regional Administrators (RAs) will be prepared for the signature of the OSF Director based on the direction of SF staff.

(1)	Analyze and synthesize the rankings from the regional offices, doing a region to region comparison, and developing a straw man list of stocks to include in the index.  

(2)	Present a suggested list of stocks for the index, with back-up analyses and documentation.

(3)	Work for acceptance of the new FSSI index within NOAA Fisheries.  This task will be completed based on discussions with, and under the direction of, SF staff.  Tasking memoranda for NMFS Regional Administrators (RAs) will be prepared for the signature of the OSF Director based on the direction of SF staff.

(4)	Provide expertise on: assessment levels reported on in the Stock Assessment Improvement Plan (SAIP), the information in the Status of Stocks reports, and the values used to derive the top 90% Long Term Potential Yield, which were obtained from the most recent version of Our Living Oceans (1999).

The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm fixed price. The award will be made on a best value basis. Best value evaluation factors include the following: 1) Past Performance - The relevancy and quality of prior performance; 2) Approach - The likelihood of effectively meeting the requirements; 3) Price - The amount, realism and consistency of the evaluated price. 

The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Number 2001-27. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items - The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offer or whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27. 

****The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all Responsible Parties may submit a quote.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for two (2) YB66 Single Crystal Wafers to be used by NIST’s Ceramics Division in the ultra-high vacuum x-ray beamline X24A that is located at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).  This monochromator uses a double crystal boomerang type design to obtain fixed exit, monochromatic beam over its entire energy range.  Before the monochromator, there is a vertically collimating circular mirror with a 1 kilometer radius, and after the monochromator there is a horizontally focusing cylindrical mirror.

The YB66 crystals shall operate inside the monochromator, and they shall be used to deliver monochromatic x-rays via Bragg diffraction from the “white” beam produced by the NSLS x-ray storage ring.
All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line item:

****LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity of two (2) YB66 Single Crystal Wafers meeting the following required specifications:

**The YB66 crystals shall be oriented and cut to expose the (400) crystal plane as the crystal surface.  These planes shall have a 2d spacing of 11.72 angstroms because the energy range for which we intend to use the crystals is between 1 and 2 keV.  The crystals must be clean and ready for use in ultra-high vacuum;
**Each crystal must be 40 mm long and 20 mm wide.  The crystals must be a minimum of 1 mm thick, and both crystals must have the same thickness;
**The single-crystal quality of both crystals must be checked by the supplier by x-ray diffraction rocking-curve analysis, and this analysis must be supplied with the crystals.  The crystal rocking curves of both crystals shall have only a single peak across the entire surface of the crystal.  The width and theta value of the crystal rocking curves of both crystals must be identical to the test crystal across the entire surface of the crystal;
**The full width at half maximum of the crystal rocking curve for both crystals must translate to a resolution on X24A that is better than 0.25 eV at 1100 eV increasing monotonically to better than 1 eV at 2000 eV;
**X-ray topographic analysis of the crystals will be performed by NIST.  The x-ray topographs must demonstrate that the entire surface of both crystals diffracts at the same Bragg angle, and that the crystals are free of defects, such as twinning, grain structures, differences in lattice constant, fabrication damage (such as scratches, pits, and digs), etc., across their entire surfaces;
**The entire surfaces of both crystals must be homogeneous as revealed by x-ray topography (performed by NIST) and have a single peak in its x-ray diffraction rocking curve.  The entire surface will be mapped for each crystal by NIST.

****DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION and shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.Broad Agency Announcement For the White Sands Missile Range Advanced Digital Radar Suite Scope The U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) New Mexico has a requirement to develop a system of advanced networked instrumentation radar systems.  This system of radars, called the advanced digital radar suite (ADRS), will be replacing most of the ex isting radar systems currently in use at WSMR and potentially other Test and Evaluation Ranges. The ADRS initiative will include a two-phased Broad Agency Announcement, inviting the radar industry to participate in an in-depth study and design approach, addressing the capability requirements of the WSMR and other T&E Ranges.  The first phase will fun d up to 4 teams to conduct independent preliminary efforts of the ADRS.  Each team will receive $25k for the phase one effort.  The second phase will down select from 4 teams to 2 teams, and will fund each of the two teams $500k to provide a complete, deta iled plan for the successful design, development and production of the ADRS at White Sands Missile Range. PHASE I WSMR is inviting all interested and capable Offerors to respond to this announcement by providing a summary of their companys experience in designing, developing, and fielding of state-of-the-art radar systems.  The size of the company, its engineering de sign, development and production capabilities should be included as part of the response.  Additionally, the respondents to this announcement should explain their knowledge and experience in the area of Instrumentation Radar used within the Test and Evalua tion of the DoD, and explain their ability to successfully design, develop and field an ADRS system and/or subsystems.  It is encouraged that all Offerors utilize a partnership or team-approach with radar technology-specific companies (e.g. a transmitter, receiver, antenna pedestal, or signal processor OEM) to address all of the required capabilities of the ADRS.  The Offerors response should also include the team makeup (if a team is to be used), and their respective role within the team. The WSMR ADRS team will evaluate the Respondents to this announcement, and up to four applicants will be awarded a $25k contract to conduct a feasibility study and preliminary design effort (FSPDE) to define their ideas and present their approach to the WS MR ADRS team.  Deliverable under this portion will be a document listing the preliminary assessments of the ADRS, the radar technologies that could be used to address the requirements, and an oral presentation and tour of the Offerors facility to the Gove rnment.  The Government will provide a document to the selected Offerors specifying the capability requirements that should be addressed in their documentation while conducting their independent approach to the ADRS.  The Offerors will be encouraged to vis it WSMR to conduct a site visit of the current radar systems. Duration of Phase I:  6 weeks  Funds available $25k each  (up to 4 separate FSPDE, $100k total) Once selected, the four teams will address the following: 	Conduct feasibility study of available technologies. 	Document their preliminary design approach. 	Performance criteria of the ADRS. 	Document the analysis and effort required to complete the system design and performance. 	Estimation of cost and schedule. 	Team participants and their roles within the project. 	Provide an Oral presentation of the effort findings at the Offerors facility. 	Provide facility tour to the Government. Evaluation of the oral proposal will result in the selection of two contractors who will receive contracts for the development of a con cept design for the ADRS and the improvement at other DoD ranges.  Two years will be allowed for the development of the design.  These designs will be evaluated based on criteria that will be provided at the time of award.  The design offering the best val ue for the Government will result in a build contract for that design as funds become available.  It is anticipated that White Sands Missile Range alone will be investing about $40M in their range.  In addition all other ranges will be able to order from t he build contract.   Phase II The second phase will consist of funding two independent, all-encompassing studies, which will provide complete and detailed Roadmap documents for the successful implementation of the ADRS at WSMR.   The Offerors will be tasked to provide a document that completely details their respective ADRS design approach.  This document will be the Offerors Proposal to the Government for the design and development of the ADRS, including a complete cost breakdown , milestone and schedule of the effort.  Two long-term Contracts (Task Orders) will then be established with the two Contractors to develop the ADRS system and/or subsystems after the evaluation of the resultant Proposal documents.  During the period of pe rformance under the Task Order Contracts, the Government may elect to develop subsystem A from Team 1, and develop subsystem B from Team 2 based on the Governments best buy evaluation.  Phase II Duration  Complete ADRS design Proposal (18 - 24 months) Cost $500k each for the complete design and development Proposals ($1000k total)  Follow on Task Order Contracts to develop and produce the ADRS   7 to 9 years Planned U.S. Army at WSMR $40M + This FBO announcement requests at minimum, the following : 	A summary of relevant experience and knowledge in Radar technologies.
