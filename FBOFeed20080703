NOTE: Aluminum framed and fabric covered shelters are not acceptable.
<p>This announcement constitutes the only synopsis. This requirement is a 100% Set Aside for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price commercial contract. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 332311 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Performance period will be 180 days after award of the contract.</p>
<p>Davis Bacon (FAR 22.403-1) and Berry Amendment (DFAR 252.225-7014) rules apply for this acquisition. Offerors will be required to provide certification of compliance with the Berry Amendment. Violation of the Berry Amendment constitutes a potential violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In determining the best value, the government shall consider Price and Past Performance. NOTE: Past performance will be significantly more important than Price when being evaluated. Past performance questionnaire submissions will be required before the due date of the proposal. The government will query past performance references submitted. Offerors will be required to provide past performance questionnaire submissions from at least two (2) and no more than five (5) relevant contracts, from different customers, performed for other Federal agencies or commercial agencies within the last three (3) years.

There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government for contract purposes until funds are made available to the contracting officer. The contracting officer will confirm availability of funds in writing to the contractor upon award. ADDED: Due to budgetary and Straddle Authority funding limitations and constraints, the government reserves the right to award all or a portion of this requirement in either FY 2008 or FY 2009. Prospective contractors are cautioned to closely review the Schedule Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) on the solicitation as they contain multiple timelines and options for pricing. As a result of this option pricing structure, the Government will not provide a price adjustment if material and/or shipping cost change between the award date and the start date of the contract, therefore; offerors shall take this into consideration when submitting their proposal.</p>
<p>A formal site visit will be conducted. A Pre-Site Visit Conference Meeting will be held at the Sheppard AFB Base Contracting Office Auditorium, Bldg 1664, 136 K Ave, Suite 1. This meeting will provide an overview of the project and will allow for accountability and transportation arrangements (Government Bus) to the project site. The aircraft shelter installation area is within a designated Sheppard AFB controlled area, therefore all site visit attendees will require physical escort to the project area. Privately owned vehicles will not be allowed on the aircraft parking apron. Site visit and conference meeting dates/times will be finalized in the solicitation. NOTE: The government will not accept questions regarding the site visit and technical specification requirements after the date specified in the solicitation; therefore, attendance is at the contractor's discretion and expense. The government will not reimburse attendees for travel expenses.</p>
<p>All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004. CCR can be accessed at https://www.bpn.gov/ or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<SUBJECT>Assess Genetic Susceptibility to Manganese Neurotoxicity

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Cincinnati, Ohio hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to The University of Cincinnati for the <br />following: Analyses to Assess Genetic Susceptibility to Manganese Neurotoxicity.<br />Background and Objectives<br />Manganese is an essential nutrient with roles in normal human physiology; however, chronic exposure to high doses of inhaled manganese dust or fumes can result in a well-described Parkinson-like syndrome known as "manganism." Effects include tremors, weakness, reduced hand-eye coordination and psychological impairments. There is also substantial evidence from human studies that chronic low doses of inhaled manganese can produce deleterious effects. Common workplace exposures include arc welding and steel production. Recent reports of cognitive deficits in chronically exposed workers indicate current OELS, including the NIOSH REL, may not provide sufficient protection against manganese-induced neurotoxicity.</p>
<p>The goal of the proposed project is to improve risk assessment for inhaled Mn by incorporating the most recent information on genetic susceptibility and human genetic diversity into models currently in use. Traditional genotyping methods are available to identify potential biomarkers of susceptibility using known DNA polymorphisms. In addition, new methods of DNA analysis offer promise as novel, early biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility and disease prior to the development of irreversible adverse health effects. We propose to obtain data from both traditional and novel methods to better assess genetic susceptibility to neurotoxicity following chronic, low-level occupational exposure to inhaled manganese</p>
<p>Only one study has focused on genetic susceptibility to neurological deficits following occupational manganese exposure. That study identified a common CYP2D6 allele as a risk factor for manganism in a Chinese worker population. Interestingly, CYP2D6 genotype may also play a role in the development of Parkinson's Disease. However, there is widely recognized phenotypic variation in CYP2D6 between Chinese and Caucasian populations. Therefore, the role of CYP2D6 polymorphisms in the development of neurological deficits following occupational manganese exposure must be confirmed in a non-Chinese population. We will obtain data using traditional genotyping methodology to compare phenotypic variation in a non-Chinese, manganese-exposed population.</p>
<p>A secondary goal is to obtain data which can be used to develop new biomarkers of exposure, illness, and susceptibility. The latency to develop neurological symptoms following occupational manganese exposure can stretch over many years; therefore, the development of an early biomarker is an important research need. Blood Mn levels do not accurately reflect chronic exposures due to different pharmacokinetics in blood and other target tissues.</p>
<p>The specific focus will be on the genes most relevant to its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion:<br />(SLC11A2/DMT1 (Divalent metal transporter 1)<br />TF (Transferrin)<br />TFRC (Transferrin receptor)<br />SLC39A4 (ZIP4)<br />SLC39A8 (ZIP 8)<br />SLC 39A14 (ZIP 14)<br />HFE (hereditary hemochromatosis factor).</p>
<p>The endpoint of greatest interest is neurotoxicity, because neurological impairment is often irreversible and has high social and economic costs. Genes which might serve as biomarkers of disease include: GABRA2, GAD1, HOXA1, NEUROD1, NEUROD2, PGR, STK11, SYK</p>
<p>Data will be obtained using blood previously collected from a manganese-exposed cohort. A detailed description of the work to be completed is described in the Statement of Work. <br />Statement of Work <br />Task 1. RFLP Genotyping Data (CYP2D6) and Mn Data Summary<br />Allele-specific PCR-RFLP analysis will be done for 80 Mn-exposed adults, using the methods of Zheng et al.1,2 to determine each subject's CYP2D6 genotype. All data will be provided without subject names, personal identifiers or any coding that could be used to link samples with individual names. Contractor researchers will maintain full responsibility for privacy, confidentiality, and security of computers where personal identifiers and codes are stored. Reports to CDC-NIOSH will include the following information: age, sex, CYP2D6 genotype, environmental Mn exposure, blood Mn level, hair Mn level, results from postural sway testing, results from postural hand tremor testing.</p>
<p>Task 2: DNA Methylation Array Data and Analysis<br />With the assistance of the NIOSH project officer, 8 individuals within the larger cohort will be classified as "most affected" and 8 as "least affected" based on exposure and outcome data provided in Task 1. Using the NimbleGen array technology and the manufacturer's protocols, DNA methylation patterns will be compared between the 8 most highly affected and the 8 least affected Mn-exposed adults. Genomic DNA will be sonicated to produce fragments ~200-700 bp, then immunoprecipitated with an antibody against 5-methyl cytidine. Enrichment of MeDIP DNA will be validated before labeling of experimental and total DNA and co-hybridization on a NimbleGen&reg; Promoter plus CpG island array. Array images will be used for data extraction, comparing the intensity ratio of immunoprecipitated DNA to total DNA, thus identifying methylated regions across the genome. A known methylated region will be used as a positive control and a known unmethylated region as the negative control. Four technical replicates will be performed to determine platform variability.</p>
<p>This work will be conducted at the contractor's facility and will include a statistical analysis of the array results by GML bioinformatics staff. The report to NIOSH will include a list of all differentially methylated genes, a recommendation of the ten best candidate genes for verification, images used for data analysis, and the statistical interpretation of the array data.</p>
<p>Task 3: Validation of Genes Using Bisulfite Sequencing<br />Following consultation with, and approval of, the NIOSH project officer, differential DNA methylation patterns on five candidate genes identified in Task 2 will be verified using bisulfite sequencing and specific DNA methylation sites on the genes of interest will be determined. A total of 50 DNA samples will be used in Task 3.</p>
<p>Delivery, Review, and Payment<br />The data and final reports will be delivered to the NIOSH project officer in three segments as described in the "Deliverables Schedule." For each deliverable, the following system will be used:</p>
<p>1.) Deliver a draft report in the specified file format (See "Format Requirements") to the NIOSH Project Officer one month prior to the completion date specified in the "Deliverables Schedule."<br />2.) The NIOSH Project Officer will return comments and requests for clarifications and revisions within 7 business days of receipt of the draft report.<br />3.) Deliver a final, revised report in the specified file format (See "Format Requirements") to the NIOSH Project Officer by the date specified in "Deliverables Schedule."</p>
<p>Format Requirements for Reports, Data Files, and Computer Programs <br />All reports will be delivered in both paper and electronic form, in CDC approved word processing software (Microsoft Word 2003 or earlier), formatted for 8 1/2" x 11" paper, with 1-inch margins and numbered pages. The cover page will include the project/award number, title, author(s), affiliation(s), and date completed. Data files will be delivered in the format specified by NIOSH: Microsoft Excel compatible with Office 2003 for data summaries and JPEG files (600 dpi minimum) for array image files. All files must be PC-compatible.</p>
<p>Each report should consist of:<br />&bull; A cover page including the project/award number, title, author(s), affiliation(s), and date completed (Word 2003 or earlier)<br />&bull; A summary of the work completed and data delivered along with a brief description of all files and records included in the report for that task (Word 2003 or earlier).<br />&bull; Data summarized in an Excel (2003 or earlier) spreadsheet</p>
<p>The report for Task 1 (RFLP Genotyping and Mn Data) should also include:<br />&bull; a JPEG image of a representative genotyping gel<br />&bull; a unique sample code linking RFLP data with Mn exposure and health effects data (This code cannot be the same code used by UC researchers analyzing the Marietta cohort data.)</p>
<p>The report for Task 2 (DNA Methylation Arrays) should also include:<br />&bull; JPEG images of DNA methylation array data<br />&bull; Statistical analysis by GML bioinformatics staff summarized in Microsoft Excel (2003 or earlier)</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Market Survey / Request for Information is to obtain an understanding of the current marketplace, receive information on available technology and innovative approaches that fulfills agency mission needs, and enhance insight into industry capabilities and best practices.
Problem Statement: The nation's airports face increased demand for flights at peak travel times during the day.  Many of these airports have closely spaced parallel runways (CSPR) with centerlines spaced 2500 feet or less apart.   When Boeing 757 (B757) and heavy aircraft (aircraft weighing in excess of 255,000 lbs) are departing, closely spaced runways can not be used independently due to concerns about wake turbulence.  Current departure wake turbulence separation standards require that a large or small aircraft hold for two minutes (or three minutes when the runway thresholds have more than 500' relative displacement) after the departure of a B757 or heavy aircraft from a closely spaced parallel runway to avoid encountering the potentially dangerous wake vortices.  While this rule has proved safe, Government research has shown that, under certain wind conditions and departure path geometries, wakes from aircraft on one runway can not transport into the departure path of aircraft on the parallel runway (for example, when a crosswind is blowing from an upwind runway towards the runway from which the B757 or heavy aircraft departed).  Under these conditions, implementation of departure wake turbulence separation standards is unnecessary, and elimination of the wake turbulence separation delay in such cases could increase departure capacity and reduce departure delays at airports using CSPRs for departure operations.. Elimination of departure delay could result in 2 to 11 more departures per hour at airports where there is a persistent crosswind and a significant number of B757 and/or heavy aircraft operations.  Ten major airports (BOS, DTW, IAH, MEM, MIA, EWR, PHL, SEA, SFO, and STL) have been identified with these characteristics.  These airports are candidate locations for deployment of a crosswind based air traffic control decision support tool that advises FAA air traffic tower controllers when the 2 or 3 minute wake mitigation departure delay can be safely eliminated.  A concept feasibility prototype of such a decision support tool known as the Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Departure (WTMD) was evaluated in a shadow mode at the Lambert - St. Louis International Airport (STL) and the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH).  It successfully demonstrated that the CSPR crosswinds could be predicted with sufficient certainty to assure safe independent departure operations on the upwind closely spaced parallel runway.   Government research confirmed that a WTMD type system would provide safe capacity benefits for departure operations at the other 8 candidate airports as well. 
The FAA is contemplating the procurement of the WTMD capability in the FY09 or FY10 timeframe.  The envisioned WTMD system utilizes a crosswind prediction algorithm to predict significant periods of time when local winds will be favorable for use of the WTMD capability.  The Government has developed a crosswind prediction algorithm and site adaptation parameters for each of the 10 candidate airports.  The WTMD system will ingest current local surface wind observations from the FAA Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and airport specific low-level wind forecasts from the National Weather Service Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model for use by crosswind prediction algorithm.  The FAA will transfer WTMD technology used in the concept feasibility prototypes to the successful contractor as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to support the development of a hardened, supportable, FAA system requirements compliant, operational capability.  The WTMD concept feasibility prototypes, consisted of approximately 2,500 lines of code.  The prototypes provided a demonstration of the WTMD capability but did not include system software and interfaces that would be necessary for a reliable and certifiable WTMD capability in the FAA operational environment.     To the greatest extent possible, the WTMD envisioned implementation will use existing FAA processing and display systems already in service in the air traffic control tower (ATCT) environment at the candidate airports.  The envisioned system will ingest ASOS and RUC data through existing FAA interfaces.  It will utilize a COTS stand-alone processor or integrate WTMD functionality into the processing capabilities of an existing FAA system.  The envisioned WTMD system will interface to existing Tower supervisor and local controller displays in the air traffic control tower (ATCT) for display of WTMD information to the users and for input of WTMD system control commands.  The envisioned WTMD system will communicate to the ATC supervisor when an opportunity exists to use reduced wake separations for CSPR departure operations.  Should the ATC supervisor chose to utilize the WTMD procedures, specific authorization of the WTMD procedure will be provided to each impacted local controller.  WTMD system will sound a audible alarm in the air traffic control tower if internal WTMD system monitors detect an abnormal shutdown is required.  Air traffic controller training, technician training and WTMD system maintenance tools will be developed.   A means to certify the WTMD decision support tool information presented to controllers must also be developed.
The FAA plans to conduct a full and open competition for this procurement.  The procurement will include operational systems and appropriate spares for the ten candidate airports listed above plus three support systems for training, second level engineering, and testing.  The FAA envisions the WTMD development, test, installation, and operational checkout will require 4 years.  In addition, a sustaining Software Engineering Environment will be required in order to allow the FAA to perform software maintenance.  The contractor will be required to provide any unique software components that will be needed to certify and maintain the system.  The envisioned production and installation of the WTMD capability will include vendor deployment support and preparation of site adaptation data.  The envisioned maintenance concept includes Interim Contractor Depot Level Support (ICDLS) for two years following the last operational system's Contract Acceptance Inspection (CAI) to be followed by organic FAA maintenance.

<DESC>Brand Name Justification for Intent to Sole Source

The General Services Administration (GSA), Heartland Global Supply Center, FAS, intends to award a sole source order to Engenetics Technologies of 4270 Gibson Drive, Tipp City, OH, based on the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) for the following NSN: 5180-01-395-2090.  This NSN is written in accordance with a brand name part number.  GSA has determined that this brand name part number is the only item that will meet the requirements of this NSN.  GSA manages this NSN and procures this NSN on behalf of our customers.  Brand name justification as follows:

NSN 5180-01-395-2090 is a brand name item, written in accordance with Enginetics Technologies INC part number 140151.  Enginetics Technologies Inc. is the sole manufacturer for this Aircraft Maintenance Tool Kit, which is used on the AH-64 attack helicopter to stake various sizes of bearings in place.  The purpose of the subject tool kit is to stake anti-friction bearings into associated rod ends, bellcranks, supports and other components during assembly, overhaul and repair of AH-64 A/D helicopters.  Without the staking tool, the cost burden on the user is increased and the maintenance down time is lengthened.  Also, without the staking tool, the AH-64A/D Apache Attack helicopter experiences drastic reduction in flight safety, mission function capabilities and readiness.

The above paragraph outlines and justifies this brand name item in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), 13.106-1(b)(3), 5.102(a)(6) and 11.105(a)(3).  Since the anticipated cost is under the simplified acquisition threshold, FAR 13.106-(b)(2), 13.5 and 6.302-1(c) do not apply.

This is not a solicitation or request for quote.  

The GSA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the government’s best interest.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your capability statement via email to Marianne Schrik/Contract  Specialist at  Marianne.schrik@gsa.gov,  no later than July 10, 2008 5 p.m.  The determination to not compete this requirement is at the discretion of the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a sole source Request forProposal (RFP) to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) for continued performanceunder the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Consolidated HST Associated Mission Products(CHAMP) contract.  The current scope of the CHAMP contract includes the development ofall flight hardware and ground systems needed to conduct servicing missions and performon-orbit checkout, as well as ongoing systems management and operations functions for theHST mission.  The current contract period is based on a planned Servicing Mission 4 (SM4)launch date of October 2008, followed by six months of SM Orbital Verification (SMOV)activities, resulting in an expected expiration date of April 2009.  SM4 will be the 5thand last Servicing Mission to HST. NASA intends to enter into a sole source contract with LMSSC under the statutoryauthority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  LMSSC has been the HSTPrograms CHAMP prime contractor since the Observatorys launch.  During this time, LMSSChas been responsible for all HST aspects of servicing preparation, including developmentand delivery of spacecraft hardware, hardware integration and test, HST flightoperations, ground and flight systems engineering, and ground system and flight softwaredevelopment for the telescope.	The breadth and depth of LMSSCs HST-unique knowledge andexpertise make them the only potential offeror capable of sustaining the HST missionoperation and accomplishing the HST Programs Automated Operations Development (AOD) andLife Extension Initiative (LEI) development activities necessary for HSTs continuedperformance.   The CHAMP team is the team that developed the HST ground and spacecraftsystems as they exist today, and the CHAMP team is the only team with experienceoperating them.  LMSSC has acquired unique experience and extensive knowledge resolvinganomalies, developing workarounds, and modifying the procedures, techniques andapproaches used to operate an aging HST.  This expertise makes LMSSC uniquely qualifiedto assess and understand HST subsystem anomalies, recommend actions and resume themissions science operations in minimum time.  The HST mission architecture is complexand custom-designed and its procedures are intricate.  As a result of its integral rolein designing and developing all aspects of this architecture, LMSSC is the only sourcecapable of performing the Governments requirement. This continued performance is required to complete the design and development of newautomated operations procedures and complete the design and implementation of major newcapabilities to mitigate component aging, slow down the degradation of HST subsystems,and improve the response to failures that may otherwise end the science mission. Examples of these activities include the development of large onboard command storage andbuffering capability for both payload and spacecraft bus commands, the development of anautomated health and safety monitoring capability for HST and the ground systems, and thedevelopment of a Two-Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) Science Mode and a Two-RWA SoftwareSun-Point Safe Mode.  The continued performance will also ensure uninterrupted, postservicing mission, observatory operations from the end of the current contract periodthrough November 2010, which is the planned date for completion of the developmentactivities.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.However, organizations that believe they can provide these services without anydetrimental impact to the program schedules and scientific output of the HST observatorymay submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to theidentified point of contact not later than 4:00PM EST on July 18, 2008.  Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate a sole source commercial item procurement with The Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) for the Education, Training and Development of a VA Palliative Care Leadership Training Program. The purpose of this program is to stimulate development of quality palliative care programs at select VA facilities within Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) to guide the implementation of proven practices that will result in improved program consistency and access to palliative care for veterans.  CAPC serves as the primary training resource and information clearinghouse for hospitals and medical professionals developing or strengthening palliative care services in the United States.  VA Staff will receive this training as a means to meet veterans' end of life care needs in a more efficient manner.  There are no comparable training programs on the scale of CAPC which in turn will become part of a larger comprehensive End-Of-Life Initiate and has a workload requirement far beyond the capabilities of VA's current hospice and palliative care staff.  This contract requires only one contractor to achieve this project's goals. This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit quotations no later than 12 Noon, July 9, 2008 EST to:  Marchelle.Peyton@va.gov or Fax: 757-728-3132.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Air Control, Inc., Henderson, NC, for the purchase of a Model Microvoid FH-25-PP-6FT Fume Hood.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in –

(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland, currently uses an Air Control fume hood in the laboratory to perform acid work.  Specifically, the hood will be used for cleaning of silicon wafers and other substrates and for sample assembly.  In order to maintain consistency and compatibility with the Division’s existing fume hood, the Center requires an additional Air Control fume hood.  Air Control, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by July 17, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on behalf of the Detection, Inspection, and Enforcement Technologies (DIET) Program of the Office of Law Enforcement Standards (OLES), with VAWD Applied Science & Technology Corporation of Tucson, AZ, for an upgrade to NIST’s existing Long Range Tracking Radar System, the CLRS-EXPL-200, awarded competitively in Fiscal Year 2007.

NIST intends to upgrade this existing system to avoid additional and redundant expenditures and delivery delays.

The required upgrade needs to be 100% compatible with the existing system.  The Contractor will have to physically take possession of NIST’s existing system and insert new hardware (circuit boards) into the existing electrical chassis and install new software that uses the newly installed hardware.

 The upgrade will enable the CLRS-EXPL-200 to meet the following requirements:
• 18 bit instantaneous dynamic range;
• Instantaneous IF bandwidth greater than 400 MHz;
• Range resolution less than 0.7 m;
• Detection of human targets at greater than 50 meters standoff through concrete block walls;
• 3 dimensional human target tracking: range, azimuth, and elevation;
• Compact PCI modularization;
• Total power consumption of less than 800W at 120 VAC;
• Dual simultaneous transmission and reception;
• 3.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz Operation;
• Peak output RF power of at least 20 dBm;
• Simultaneous fully polarimetric measurement capability;
• Transmitter blanking for reduced interference.

The contemplated effort is a follow-on acquisition to continue development on a highly specialized piece of equipment as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This system being procured is an upgrade to the existing equipment 

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a 
follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in—
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agency’s requirements.   (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B)

The existing equipment and the upgrade are commercial items.  VAWD  has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  

The upgrade must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to VAWD.  VAWD has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can provide this upgrade.   

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by July 18, 2008, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Badlands National Park intends to award a 2 year contract for radio transmitter collars to Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. (ATS) on a non-competetive basis.
Badlands National Park has been purchasing radio transmitter collars from ATS under a previous contract for the past four years.  Collars are returned to ATS at the end of the study period for refurbishment and subsequent reuse.  ATS is the only company that will refurbish its manufactured collars.  They also are the only known company to manufacture a collar for swift fox with a 45 degree antennae bend on a spring.  This is a desirable feature that improves durability of the radio collar on this burrowing fox.
Past market research and solicitations for the same and similar items have shown ATS to have competitive pricing and the ability to provide a reliable, sturdy and quality product that is able to meet specific project requirements.
Award will be made o/a July 15, 2008.  Contact person for questions is Chris Esper at 605-574-3153 or email at chris_esper@nps.gov.  Award amount for the base year contract and one renewable option year is anticipated to be $30,343.70, depending on amount of collars ordered and refurbished each year.
Radio Transmitter Collar Specifications:1. Crystal controlled transmitter tuned to user specified frequencies:Frequencies will be in the 164.000-166.999 range.Specific frequencies will be identified when the order is placed.2. Transmitter dimensions - 49mm * 27mm * 14mm.3. Collar to be smooth to prevent neck abrasion and have a finished width to greater than 2.0 cm.Inside diameter adjustable from 4.3 cm to 10.2 cm. Preferred collar material neoprene.4. External spring antenna offset ~ 45 degrees from collar braid, not to exceed 15 cm.5. Transmitter activated by magnetic reed switch.6.

These motors shall be located outside of the temperature conditioned space and the fans shall be driven by means of extended stainless steel shafts designed with bearing that will operate over the full performance range of the chamber. C.2.2 The air circulation shall be designed to provide a minimum 6,000 CFM airflow.   The 6,000 CFM requirement applies if the chamber is configured as three individual cells or one large chamber. The fans shall be designed to prevent air stratification throughout the chamber. C.2.3	No material, such as liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide, shall be injected into the chamber to achieve the required temperature conditions.  C.2.4	The humidity system shall employ a solid-state humidity sensor and the vapor generator shall be constructed of stainless steel.C.2.5	The steam generator shall be equipped with an over-temperature limit.	C.2.6	A low water protection device shall be supplied for the vapor generator. C.2.7	The chamber shall be equipped with a water demineralizer system with a replaceable cartridge.  The filter shall remove contaminates from the water than enters the humidity system to prolong life of components. C.2.8 The relative humidity of the air within the chamber shall be decreased by refrigeration coils.  These coils shall be located out the main air stream and properly baffled to prevent upsetting the dry bulb.C.2.9	The system shall provide adequate cooling of the compressors and the refrigerant system shall be designed with CFC-free refrigerants. C.2.10 Personnel will enter the chamber while at cold temperature for test item inspection.  Substantial quantities of hot and humid outside air will enter the chamber.  The chamber shall include the necessary venting to prevent chamber structural damage from pressure changes. C.2.11 The conditioning section shall be located such that it maximizes the usable internal volume of the chamber.  Building 9462 has a ceiling height of over 20-ft, so conditioning machinery could be located above the chamber.	C.2.12	All machinery shall be enclosed and equipped with OSHA-approved fan guards. C.2.13	The compressors may be cooled with either an air-cooled condenser or a water tower.  The vendor shall show calculations of temperature performance depending on what type of cooling is chosen.  If water cooling is used, the vendor shall supply and install the necessary cooling tower for chamber operation.  The cooling tower or air-cooled condenser shall be located on an existing concrete pad behind building 9462.  The vendor shall provide all necessary interconnects between the cooling equipment and the chamber machinery section.

<DESC>Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office has a requirement to provide Administrative Support Services for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA).  The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal/objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand.  Contractor provided administrative and clerical support services are required to support this mission.
Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  It is the Navy?s intention to consolidate these five existing contracts at into one contract.  These sites, and the existing contracts and contractors currently providing services are as follows: Training Air Wing One - NAS Meridian, MS ? contract N00140-05-P-0318, with Symtech, Springfield, VA.  Training Air Wing Two ? NAS Kingsville, TX, - contract N00140-05-M-0018 with Symtech, Springfield, VA.  Training Air Wing Four - NAS Corpus Christi, TX- N00140-05-P-0539, with Nitelines, Duluth, GA.  Training Air Wing Five - NAS Whiting Field, FL - with Aquasis,  Cantonment, FL and Training Air Wing Six - NAS Pensacola, FL, with Deltha Critique, New Orleans, LA.

This effort is to provide direct administration support services to the Training Air Wings listed above.   The administrative support includes, but is not limited to, functions such as scheduling student pilots for training events, maintaining records, providing secretarial support and word processing duties.  

The Government intends to conduct a Total Small Business set aside competitive acquisition for these services, under the NAICS code of 561110.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical proposal, which is anticipated to be more important than the price proposal.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be a 5-year contract with one (1) base year and four (4) option years.  It is intended to have the new contract in place for the commencement of services on 1 April 2008.   

Note that the response time listed herein is an estimate.  It is anticipated that the RFP can be issued in a mid. Nov. timeframe, with a 30 day response time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

It is important that you submit the following information as requested.  Documentation submitted must be thorough and complete.   The Postal Service is not required to contact you to get additional information or clarification regarding the information that you submit.

Overview:

The solicitation to be issued is to procure transportation of units, containing mail or empty equipment, between two points (“segments," also known as “lanes”). The offeror will provide service beginning on or about 10/01/2008 should the USPS require it. If awarded, the contract(s) will be awarded as an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with a fixed price for a term of 2-years.

The USPS intends to use an on-line competitive bidding event process, using an optimization tool (CombineNet). The event will consist of two solicitations:  Mail (identified as A”, “C", “D” "G", or "Y”) Segments and Mail Transport Equipment (MTE) (identified as “E”) Segments.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Climate Research &amp; Applications Division intends to award a requirement on a sole source basis with the Board of Trustees, University of Alabama&nbsp;pursuant to FAR part 13 under Simplified Acquisitions&nbsp;to adapt the technique used by Mecikalski and Bedka (2006) for the detection of 0-1 hr convective initiation (i.e. the first occurrence of a &ge;35 dBZ radar eco from a convective cloud) to an application optimized for GOES-R. This project will involve software development, testing on proxy datasets, validation and documentation. This work will insure the readiness of the convective initiation nowcastingalgorithm for operational implementation upon the deployment of GOES-R.</p>
<p>The services required by Climate Research &amp; Applications Division are available from only one responsible source, Board of Trustees, University of Alabama.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>Develop and evaluate algorithm for ABI 0-2 hour CI nowcasting product generation and provide science codes to algorithm integrate team (AIT) for sofrware implementation and process demonstration. We plan to use locally available hardware resources. Initially for software testing, with a phased transition to a collaborative testbed environment as it comes online. The proxy data will leverage off of existing imagery from GOES and especially from MSG/SEVERI via collaborations with EUMETSAT. Only a pre-development effort was supported in 2007, with a full spin-up expected during this funding period. Much of the code and initial documentation is completed.</p>
<p>1.0 Suggested Staffing <br />The level of effort required is 0.86 FTE for 12 months.</p>
<p>2.0 Deliverables</p>

Development of test plan and convective validation dataset (Summer 08)<br />4. Complete porting CI code so to adhering to AIT AWG standards (Summer 08)<br />5. Complete the draft of ATBD document (Fall 08)<br />6. Release version 1 .O of code (Winter 08)<br />7. Complete Flowchart for AIT (Winter 08)<br />8. Algorithm Implementation and Testplan Documents (Spring 09)<br />9. Algorithm Demonstration walk through (Spring O9)<br />10. Optimize ABI CI nowcasting using coIlocated MODIS/Cloudsat/Calipso<br />datastream leveraging NASA ROSES &amp; EUMETSAT work (Spring 09)<br />11. Receive feedback towards code upgrading via AIT feedback (Spring 09)<br />12. Monthly highlights and detail quarterly reports and progress</p>
<p>3.0 Travel</p>
<p>One trip for two people to Washington, D.C. to attend a 4-day meeting (GOES-R AWG review). One trip for two people to attend a 4-day GOES-R AWG Review in Madison, WI. Also a five-day trip for two people to attend an AMS meeting (Phoenix, AZ).</p>

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for preparation of working drawings and specifications, cost estimates, submittal review, other construction period services for Minor Construction Project Number 528-712, Expand Pharmacy for Current and Projected Workload at the VA Medical Center, Syracuse.  It is the intent to complete the design as early as possible in Fiscal Year 2009 for construction solicitation during the 4th quarter and for construction award in early Fiscal Year 10. Investigative services shall include review of VA program requirements and project scope to determine the equipment and construction criteria, and to provide preliminary plans, drawings, and estimates.  Design services shall include, but not be limited to, providing complete working drawings, specifications, and detailed cost estimates.  Services include meeting with various VA employees in order to fully understand the functional needs, carefully reviewing the space selected for this project, preparation of construction cost estimates, designs and construction contract documents as described herein.  Design services for asbestos abatement, to be required at any time during the project, shall be required for an additional fee.  Asbestos Monitoring services during construction may be required of the A/E as a reimbursable expense if that should occur.  Design services shall include infection control design in order to be in compliance with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards.  Drawings will be CADD generated demonstrated to be fully compatible with AutoCad 2008.  Specifications shall be compiled from VA master specifications which are available on the internet.Short-List Criteria to select the firms for interview will be based on specialized experience and technical competence, specific experience and qualifications of proposed personnel and consultants along with record of working together as a team, past performance for VA work, geographic location of the firm, success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, waste reduction and energy efficiency, and the inclusion of small business consultants.  Special consideration in the evaluation and selection process will be given to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Final ranking of interviewed firms will be based on the team proposed for this project, the proposed management plan, previous experience of the team, geographic location of the firm, proposed design approach, project control, creative and innovative designs, sustainable design, miscellaneous experience & capabilities, ability to mitigate project cost and project risk assessments.The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the designs located within a 50 mile radius of the Syracuse VA Medical Center.  Appropriate data for this project must be submitted to the Contracting Officer on Standard Form 330 no later than August 8, 2008.  FIVE COPIES OF EACH (along with any supplemental information) ARE REQUIRED.  Submissions should emphasize experience on similar projects, the key personnel to be assigned to this project, and specific VA experience.  This is not a request for proposals.  NAICS 541310 applies. Construction cost estimate is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.The project will renovate the north and north-west wing of the first floor which currently does not house any pharmacy functions. It will allow the consolidation of pharmacy offices onto the 1st floor, currently located on the 9th floor. Coagulation & Dermatology Outpatient Clinics currently in the west wing will be relocated to the south wing of abandoned pharmacy space. Dental clinic and Dental laboratory currently in the west and north-west wing will be relocated off station. Phase one of the project will include demolition of the dental space and renovation in order to move the outpatient pharmacy operation into this space to include an increased capacity of waiting room, and private outpatient consultation rooms in order to meet HIPPA requirements. Phase two of the project will renovate existing outpatient pharmacy waiting area into clinic space in order to move existing anticoagulation and dermatology clinic. Phase three will renovate vacated clinic space in order for inpatient pharmacy operations to be moved this will also include renovation of the space for the sterile compounding area. The final phase will be to renovate existing pharmacy space to accommodate additional clinical pharmacy services, expand procurement intake, provide storage space for drugs and supplies in corrugated cardboard, and expand investigational drug storage space. This will entail demolition of the 1st floor wings and new construction to include walls, ceilings, utility infrastructure upgrades and redesign to include HVAC and meet pharmacy security requirements.When applying projected outpatient prescription workload for year 2015 (the number of prescriptions filled per unique patient per year times the market share of enrollees for the year 2015), the space requirements are estimated to be 15,400 gsf. The existing pharmacy square footage is 7176 gsf. This project will supplement pharmacy by 5129 gsf. Space constraints do not allow for accommodating the entire gap, efficiencies in operation will provide for the shortfall. Syracuse VA Medical Center is in the process of converting from an SCI clinic setting to an SCI Center. This will entail the addition of 30 more beds for the inpatient unit and an increased outpatient population. Pharmacy needs to provide additional coverage for this population. Syracuse has also been identified as a Polytrauma network site and has already seen over 1,100 new OEF/OIF patients. The proximity of Syracuse VAMC to Ft. Drum and the close relationship that has developed between the two has enabled Syracuse to reach out and serve these soldiers both as active duty and as veterans. Along with this growth, we anticipate a 25% increase in projected workload within the next 10 yrs. based on the VHA strategic planning guidance. The outpatient pharmacy consultation booths do not provide privacy for patient counseling as required by HIPPA and, at a minimum, the new design will provide individual counseling rooms separate from the pharmacy waiting room that are wider and more handicap accessible. The pharmacy waiting room does not provide sufficient space for wheelchair bound veterans to maneuver within the space. The new design will provide sufficient space to accommodate wheel chair bound patients to meet our increased demand due to the growth of our SCI/D population and combat veteran population. This patient-centered care for our most vulnerable patients will assist us in meeting the VHA strategic goals. Patient flow through the area will be addressed from the counseling area to the waiting area to the pharmacy pick-up window. The Intravenous Admixture sterile compounding area will be renovated to meet USP 797 standards by adding space for storage of drugs and supplies into the anterooms utilized during compounding. The recommendation for an anteroom space for each of the two compounding areas has decreased the current space available for storage within the anterooms. The recent clean room renovation provided a stop gap and met the physical and environmental requirements of USP797 but the project is constrained by the limits of available space within the current square footage of the pharmacy. Though two anterooms are in the current design, one of the two anterooms is too small to store any supplies that are needed for an efficient, sterile operation. Also the renovated space will include the use of pass through boxes into the space between the anterooms and the preparation areas, as this will reduce the disruption of airflow in the sterile preparation areas and provide a cleaner sterile preparation field. Building a new, efficient pharmacy will also address the difficulty Syracuse experiences in attracting quality Pharmacists. The current, cramped pharmacy forces the pharmacists to share workstations, interrupting dedicated processes and slowing the flow. Due to the VHA commitment to Readiness to Respond, the current procurement space needs to be expanded accordingly. The new space will accommodate two workstations and will provide for a dedicated intake area for drug/ supply deliveries and distribution. The project will provide a separate storage area for drugs and supplies stored in corrugated cardboard. Corrugated cardboard provides an environment for infestation and is recommended to be stored separate from drug storage space. Unfortunately, some products only come in corrugated boxes and cannot be broken down. Pharmacy storage for drugs and supply items will be consolidated to one location with minimal storage of working stock in both the inpatient and outpatient pharmacy working areas. The total function of procurement in coordination with commitment to readiness compels us to relocate the current space adjacent to the service elevators, maximizing response times and increasing the efficiency in transporting medication and supplies to and from the pharmacy, loading docks and pharmacy cache. There are 4 clinical pharmacist workstations located separate from the pharmacy, due to lack of current space. The project will include space to consolidate the workstations into the pharmacy. The pharmacy management offices are in three separate locations within the current pharmacy space, the project will include consolidated into the renovated space to co-location in order to gain further efficiencies. Investigational drug storage will be separated and secured from the other pharmacy stock. This ensures the proper use of investigational study medication. The project will include an additional 200 sq. ft. to provide for a work station within that space for preparation and dispensing of this investigational medication. Anticoagulation and Dermatology Outpatient Clinic space will be relocated into the current outpatient pharmacy waiting area. The current space has a minimal waiting room and patients overflow into the hallway of the west wing on the first floor. This design will move the outpatient clinic next to Team Red primary care clinic, allowing for a more efficient check-in and reception area.

<DESC>The oven and griddle are appliances called for in the United States Marine Corp (USMC) Statement of Need (SON) for an Expeditionary Field Kitchen (EFK). The SON requires that the EFK adhere to the one burner concept of the USMC. The one burner concept requires all new USMC acquisition programs to make use of Babingtons Airtronic burner when a burner is called for in the system. This concept allows the USMC to train and provision for one burner only and minimizes operation and support costs. Babington has proprietary control of who can purchase their burners for use in appliances. Babington is also uniquely qualified to insert the burners into appliances because they manufacture the burner and are more familiar with the characteristics of the burner than any other entity.

<DESC>TCCC DESCRIPTION - Special Notice
The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) will be conducting a Industry Day, which will be hosted by the United States Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) Fort Detrick, Maryland on 29-30 July 2008 starting at 0800 EST.  This Industry Day is to introduce the Special Operations Forces (SOF) Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) system as outlined in this notice to potential vendors.  The USSOCOM staff and subject matter experts will be available for one-on-one discussions following an open session to respond to additional vendor inquiries.  These one-on-one sessions will each be a maximum of one hour in duration and must be scheduled with the SOCOM point of contact no later than 15 July 2008.  USSOCOM is seeking sources for tailored medical and non-medical kits that are re-configurable and deployable with full operational capability in modular packages designed to accommodate SOF mission variables. A draft performance statement is attached.
The SOF Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) Kit Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) System will be used for access, rescue, evacuation and stabilization of casualties in case of a delayed or difficult transportation to Level II and or III medical care.  The system will be capable of use with SOF peculiar mobility platforms and indigenous vehicles.
The SOF CASEVAC System includes four kits with distinct capabilities and performance parameters.  The goal of this Vendor Day is to determine how best to meet SOF CASEVAC System requirements.
The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of the four kits that comprise the SOF TCCC CASEVAC System.  The four kits will provide capabilities to: 1) access casualties in a variety of tactical environments (CASEVAC-A); 2) safely recover the casualty from the site of initial wounding (CASEVAC-R); 3) expeditiously transport casualties to a Level 1 care facility and 4) sustain the casualty enroute or in place, if transport is delayed.  It is desired that kits will have a modular design in order to support deployment in whole or in part to allow man-portable/man-packable subsets available to fit into small and limited spaces on SOF mobility vehicles.
Independent items of medical and non-medical equipment will have to be National Stock Numbered (NSN) when appropriate and will be certified in accordance with commercial standards.
Only products that pertain to the categories identified will be discussed.  Vendors are required to complete a registration form and receive confirmation from the point of contact via e-mail in order to participate.  
The focus of this events is to assist with strategic market analysis of products and technologies that may be applicable to our military operating environments and missions at remote, forward deployed locations on land and ships.  Submitted material solutions need to be suitable for use in extreme environmental and operating conditions. 
Following the Vendor Day, the Government plans to update the performance specification and develop a Request For Proposal (RFP) to industry to bid for a five year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract in order to meet the SOF CASEVAC requirements.
There are no fees, however access is limited to those who can prove technical expertise by presenting a brief overview, orally or written, describing the capabilities of your company.  
Proof of technical expertise and general questions should be provided to: 
Contract Specialist, Mr. William ‘Vince’ Vincent; william.vincent@socom.mil, 813-826-1951 or Contracting Officer, Ms. Denise Green-Huneke; cdenise.green-huneke@socom.mil, 813-826-4767.

Scheduled items include: 

Purchase of Seven LCMS Systems, peripherals, and software with delivery, set-up, training, and maintenance at seven FDA laboratories in multiple geographic locations (Jefferson AR, Irvine CA, Lenexa KS, Jamacia NY, Bothell WA, Atlanta GA, College Park MD).

Objectives:
a. Purchase and setup instruments.
b. Train field staff on site and at vendor-sponsored classes.
c. Validate methods to monitor pesticide residues at seven FDA laboratories.  
d. Provide Warranty Service Agreement for instruments for a period of three years.

Minimum mass spec instrument requirements for this project:

Though each of these specifications are individually important to the success of the implementation of the system, a system which possesses and uses these features collectively is necessary to meet the government’s objectives.

General Requirements:

An integrated high performance bench top hybrid triple-quadrupole/linear ion trap LC/MS/MS system. Instrument shall have an advanced source housing hosting interchangeable APCI (Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization) probe and ESI probe. The source probe housing shall feature high temperature ceramic heaters for high flow characteristics and orthogonal spraying for improved robustness utilizing interchangeable ESI and APCI sprayer probes. The source housing must have two viewing ports – one large frontal and one lateral - for best performance optimization.  Each probe must be coded for automated identification by the software/firmware of the host system.  The source housing must include a pair of high temperature ceramic heaters, creating symmetrical turbo gas streams for optimum sample desolvation.

ESI probe must be capable of: Ionization voltage:  From -4.5 kV to +5.5 kV, user selectable. Flow rate compatibility:  From 5 &#61549;L/min to 3000 &#61549;L/min, without flow splitting.
APCI probe should be capable of:  Flow rate compatibility:  From 50 &#61549;L/min to 3000 &#956;L/min, without flow splitting.  Corona discharge current:  From -5 &#956;A to +5 &#956;A, user selectable.  Nebulizer gas from 0 to 90 psi (0-0.62 MPa), user selectable using zero grade air or Nitrogen.  Turbo gas (GS2): From ambient to 750º Celsius and from 0 to 90 psi, user selectable. Zero grade air or Nitrogen.

The instrument shall include a syringe pump for direct infusion of samples that is capable of delivering flow rates between 10 uL/min to over 10 mL/min. The instrument should include a 10 port, 2 position switching valve capable of operating as an injector, diverter valve, or for column switching experiments.  Both devices have full software control.

The instrument shall contain at least a single thin aperture from atmosphere into the vacuum chamber which can be removed and cleaned without the use of any tools.  The aperture must be followed immediately by a high-efficiency RF-only ion guide for ion focusing and containment. This is followed by a high pressure RF quadrupole followed by a metal alloy quadrupole mass filter. A pre-filter is to be located between the RF quadrupole and the first mass filter to help further focus the ions.  The pre-filter region must be capable of cooling, slowing and holding ions prior to release into Q1 to enhance the sensitivity and avoid loss of ions (Q0 trapping).  The instrument shall employ a high-pressure quadrupole linear accelerator collision cell with axial electric field ion acceleration technology following the first mass filter used for high efficiency MS/MS fragmentation. The second mass analyzer shall be of a gold-plated ceramic quadrupole mass filter/linear ion trap design. The detector of the MS shall be an ion counting, discrete dynode, electron multiplier.
The system must have a mass range of 5 – 2800 m/z.  The system shall be able to perform the following: enhanced linear ion trap scan modes with enhanced MS scan for fast, sensitive full scan single MS.  System must allow for Q0 ion trapping and afford the following functions:

•	Enhanced Multiply Charge scan significantly reducing the singly charged ion detection in a single MS scan.
•	Enhanced Product Ion scan for fast, sensitive full scan MS/MS (up to 500 times more sensitive than traditional triple quadrupole product ion scanning).
•	Enhanced Resolution scan for improved mass accuracy and charge state determination and/or isotope pattern determination
•	MS/MS/MS scan for multistage fragmentation
•	MS/MS/MS scan for selective quantitation to avoid matrix interferences.
•	Time-Delayed Fragmentation scan to reduce the amount of secondary fragment ions detected in a full MS/MS scan
•	Combine traditional RF/DC scan modes and Enhanced MS, Enhanced MS/MS and MS/MS/MS scanning capability through Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) for MW and structural information from a single injection
•	Product ion scanning for structural elucidation
•	Precursor ion and neutral loss scanning

The instrument shall be able to vary the collision energy while filling the linear ion trap.  The instrument shall be able to run in normal MRM operations and using logic built into the software, automatically switch into Q3-Linear Ion Trapping mode for logic directed full spectrum confirmation of compounds.  The linear in trapping portion of Q3 much use axial ejection of the ions to the detector.  The instrument must be able to operate as a triple quadrupole, linear ion trap, and as a triple quadrupole and linear ion trap during the same run.
Q3 must be able to switch between MRM and Enhanced Ion Scanning in under 2 mSec.

The instrument must include a 550 pesticide MRM library which defines all the optimal parameters for MS/MS analysis, with defined chromatography and retention times for each compound. 

The instrument must be able to switch from positive ion to negative ion mode and back to positive ion mode. The instrument must be able to do this under continuous operation, saving the resulting positive and negative ion data to disc.  

Other Requirements:

For laboratory flexibility the integrated system must allow for the use of multi vendor HPLC interfacing with direct, single point software control resident to the MS software including Shimadzu Prominence HPLC systems, Agilent 1200, Dionex 3000 and Waters Acquity.  The proposal must include a Shimadzu binary modular HPLC system (flow rates 0.0001-10.0 ml/min.) with full software integration, autosampler with needle rinse pump, column temperature control module, 100ul semi-micro mixer, and pump solvent/autosampler rinse phase vacuum degasser.

<CONTACT>Kathleen D Allen, Contract Specialist, Phone 314-676-0198, Email kathleen.d.allen@nga.mil
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a requirement for the following items:

1NP-34	Overwatch	Feature Analyst Pro License Upgrade	(Qty = 2)
NP-MAINT	Overwatch	Feature Analyst Pro Network Lic/Support  (Qty = 2)
1NL-35	Overwatch	LIDAR Analyst Network License  (Qty = 2)

UA-01F	Overwatch	Urban Analyst Network License  (Qty = 2)
UA-01F-M	Overwatch	Urban Analyst Network License/Support  (Qty = 2)

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: NGA InnoVision has various Spectral Scientists and Geospatial Analysts attempting to exploit LIDAR data. The current licenses are locked to specific workstations and currently it is necessary for the users to relocate to exploit the data. By upgrading the existing licenss to float, they can be used on a first available basis on any of the IEC exploitation workstations available in the InnoVision Testbed. The floating licenses will facilitate the exploitation of the data, and allow for better workflow management. There are no known single commercial applications identified that meet all of the needs of the LIDAR program that can be immediately implemented into the Enterprise at this time. Due to the fact that this software is already integrated into the NGA enterprise it would be extremely costly for the Agency to switch to a new type of software. A switch at this juncture would cause personnel to have to be trained to use new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of any new software. 

Quote should contain Open Market Commercial pricing with any applicable discounts applied. All boxes must be sealed and unopened. Total cost shall include all shipping and handling. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government.

Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price, technically acceptable source.

Optical Coating Design and Demonstration 
for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Camera

1.0 Summary

The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) requests that proposals be submitted by interested vendors for Optical Coating Design and Demonstration for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Camera.  LSST aims to perform the most comprehensive astronomical survey in history by imaging most of visible sky in a continuous series of short exposures.  LSST is currently in the exploratory R&D phase. LSST would be funded from both Federal (NSF, DOE) and private sources. SLAC would lead the collaboration focused on the development of the camera for LSST, a major instrument development effort.  Working in collaboration with SLAC, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has the lead responsibility for the camera optics.  This request for proposals seeks to identify qualified vendors for the development and fabrication of the optical coatings required for the LSST camera optics.

2.0 Introduction

The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) aims to perform the most comprehensive astronomical survey in history by imaging most of visible sky in a continuous series of short exposures. This will result in an astronomical catalog thousands of times larger than ever previously compiled.  During the ten years required for the baseline survey, ~2000 separate images will be obtained for each position on the sky, opening a revolutionary time window on our universe.  This survey will catalog billions of galaxies and discover hundreds of thousands of Type Ia supernovae.  Specific measurements will include spatial correlations in the shapes of galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing, and spatial correlations in the positions of galaxies as a result of acoustic oscillations in the primordial plasma.  Combined with studies of supernovae detected by LSST, these measurements will determine fundamental cosmological parameters and constrain the nature of dark energy and dark matter.  

The scientific programs planned to be performed with the LSST in a decade would require centuries to complete with existing telescopes because the LSST system optical throughput will be two orders of magnitude greater than any existing facility.  To achieve these unprecedented capabilities, the LSST makes use of a novel three-mirror design, with an 8.4-meter primary mirror, resulting in a field of view of 9.6 square degrees with seeing-limited image quality across a wide wavelength band.  All three mirrors will be actively supported to control wavefront distortions introduced by gravity and environmental stresses on the telescope.  The LSST camera provides a 3.2 Gigapixel focal plane array.  The entrance window to the focal plane cryostat is one of three refractive lenses in the camera.  The other two lenses are mounted in an optics structure at the front of the camera body, which also contains a mechanical shutter, and a carrousel assembly that holds five of the six large optical filters at any given time.  The LSST Observatory will be located on Cerro Pachon in Chile next to the Gemini South Telescope.

3.0 Camera Optics

Figure 1 shows the optical schematic of the telescope, including the camera optics.  
Camera optical element prescriptions are established by V3.1 of the observatory optical design (available on request).  Optical design of camera lenses and filters is integrated with optical design of telescope mirrors to optimize performance.  There are 3 refractive lenses with clear aperture diameters of 1.55m, 1.10m and 0.70m and 6 interchangeable, broad-band, filters with clear aperture diameters of 0.75m.  

 
Figure 1.   Baseline LSST optical design schematic

Derived parameters for the camera optical elements from the prescriptions are shown in Table 1.

Table 1.   Derived Camera Optical Element Parameters
 

The optical design provides excellent image quality across a flat, 3.5 degree field.  The image quality is < 0.20 arcsec FWHM in the six optical bands whose wavelength range is specified in Table 2.  

Table 2.   Baseline LSST filter band-pass FWHM points in nm
Filter	&#955;1	&#955; 2
u	330	400
g	402	552
r	552	691
i	691	818
z	818	922
y4	930	1070

The need for L1 and L2 derives from the requirement to correct the chromatic aberration introduced by L3 and the filters.  The baseline design meets this requirement using a single glass type, fused silica, for all the camera optics.  The chromatic characteristics of this design are illustrated in Figure 2.  This design introduces no net power – rays entering and leaving corrector are nearly parallel, and the focal length of telescope including corrector is nearly constant over the bandwidth of any given filter.  The F/# of the beam through the camera is f/1.23.  The beam also has a 61.5% linear obscuration due to the secondary/tertiary mirrors.  The camera optics are nominally concentric about the chief ray, so all portions of the optics see the same angle of incidence range, 14.2º to 23.6º.  At the filter, the unvignetted beam illuminating a single field point is ~100 mm in diameter.


 

Figure 2.   Illustration of camera optics chromatic correction.

Figure 3 shows a schematic view of the assembled camera.  Five filters are resident in the camera; the active filter can be changed in less than 90 seconds.  One of the six filters will be stored at off-camera at any given time and can be exchanged with any of the five on-camera filters during a daytime servicing operation.

 

Figure 3.   Baseline LSST camera design schematic

3.1 Optical Coatings

LSST camera optics require two distinct types of optical coatings:
1.	Anti-reflection (AR) coatings,
2.	Band-pass coatings.

The filters require both types of coatings while the lenses require only AR coatings.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to answer some questions posed by potential quoters, as well as to extend the response date deadline.

Questions:

“Why does this solicitation specifically call for an FTIR hyperspectral imaging device versus a more traditional “push-broom” reflective imaging instrument which has been commonly deployed for this VNIR spectral range? Can a reflective hyperspectral imager be proposed or is there a specific requirement for an FTIR device?”

and

"Item 4-A delineates that the basic spectral imaging function should be achieved using a fast fourier transfer interferometer.

Will the technical contact consider a basic spectral imaging function that utilizes a concentric imaging spectrophotometer, containing original, aberration-corrected convex holographic diffraction grating?"

Response:

Alternate technologies will be considered only if they meet or exceed all performance specifications as described in the solicitation.  Documentation (technical literature, etc.) accompanying such quotes shall clearly explain how the alternate technology works and shall address its performance capabilities relative to all performance specifications as described in the solicitation.

The response date deadline is extended to 3:00 p.m. on Friday, July 11.

All other terms and conditions of the original solicitation remain unchanged.

<DESC>Amendment A001.: 

Question:
Request clarification for Solicitation Number RFQ-CO2008510022, Definitional Mission for Manizales & Medellin Surface Transportation Projects in Colombia for the following items:


Solicitation was issued on 27 June with a due date of 11 July.  Given the amount of data required for the proposal submission, we would request an extension to 31 July for submission.


Following paragraph 1.15.4, The USG has required "all deliverables" be provided on or about 29 August 2008, or just over a month after proposal due date. Please specify which of the multiple deliverables identified in paragraph 2 and 3 are due by 29 August.  Clearly most data will be developed during the one year performance period, and not available for submission on 29 August.


Answer: 

September 30, 2008 is the end of the fiscal year therefore the program requires projects be identified and the deliverables presented to USTDA with enough reaction time to proceed with any identified actions before fiscal year end.  The Due date of July 11, 2008 remains unchanged.

The purpose of Amendment A001 is to clarify the difference between a deliverables due date and the period of performance end date.  The Government has reasonable expectations that the deliverables from the definitional mission could identify projects for Fiscal Year 08 funded application(s).  The August 29, 2008 deliverables due date from the definitional mission is correct and firm.  The period of performance ending date does not have a direct application as to when deliverables are due.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>99--Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Departure (WTMD)
<SOLNBR>DTFAWA-08-R-00034
<RESPDATE>073108
<ARCHDATE>08152008
<CONTACT>Curtis Fields, 202-385-8649

<a href="mailto:curtis.fields@faa.gov">curtis.fields@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this Market Survey / Request for Information is to obtain an understanding of the current marketplace, receive information on available technology and innovative approaches that fulfills agency mission needs, and enhance insight into industry capabilities and best practices.
Problem Statement: The nation's airports face increased demand for flights at peak travel times during the day.  Many of these airports have closely spaced parallel runways (CSPR) with centerlines spaced 2500 feet or less apart.   When Boeing 757 (B757) and heavy aircraft (aircraft weighing in excess of 255,000 lbs) are departing, closely spaced runways can not be used independently due to concerns about wake turbulence.  Current departure wake turbulence separation standards require that a large or small aircraft hold for two minutes (or three minutes when the runway thresholds have more than 500' relative displacement) after the departure of a B757 or heavy aircraft from a closely spaced parallel runway to avoid encountering the potentially dangerous wake vortices.  While this rule has proved safe, Government research has shown that, under certain wind conditions and departure path geometries, wakes from aircraft on one runway can not transport into the departure path of aircraft on the parallel runway (for example, when a crosswind is blowing from an upwind runway towards the runway from which the B757 or heavy aircraft departed).  Under these conditions, implementation of departure wake turbulence separation standards is unnecessary, and elimination of the wake turbulence separation delay in such cases could increase departure capacity and reduce departure delays at airports using CSPRs for departure operations.. Elimination of departure delay could result in 2 to 11 more departures per hour at airports where there is a persistent crosswind and a significant number of B757 and/or heavy aircraft operations.  Ten major airports (BOS, DTW, IAH, MEM, MIA, EWR, PHL, SEA, SFO, and STL) have been identified with these characteristics.  These airports are candidate locations for deployment of a crosswind based air traffic control decision support tool that advises FAA air traffic tower controllers when the 2 or 3 minute wake mitigation departure delay can be safely eliminated.  A concept feasibility prototype of such a decision support tool known as the Wake Turbulence Mitigation for Departure (WTMD) was evaluated in a shadow mode at the Lambert - St. Louis International Airport (STL) and the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH).  It successfully demonstrated that the CSPR crosswinds could be predicted with sufficient certainty to assure safe independent departure operations on the upwind closely spaced parallel runway.   Government research confirmed that a WTMD type system would provide safe capacity benefits for departure operations at the other 8 candidate airports as well. 
The FAA is contemplating the procurement of the WTMD capability in the FY09 or FY10 timeframe.  The envisioned WTMD system utilizes a crosswind prediction algorithm to predict significant periods of time when local winds will be favorable for use of the WTMD capability.  The Government has developed a crosswind prediction algorithm and site adaptation parameters for each of the 10 candidate airports.  The WTMD system will ingest current local surface wind observations from the FAA Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and airport specific low-level wind forecasts from the National Weather Service Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model for use by crosswind prediction algorithm.  The FAA will transfer WTMD technology used in the concept feasibility prototypes to the successful contractor as Government Furnished Information (GFI) to support the development of a hardened, supportable, FAA system requirements compliant, operational capability.  The WTMD concept feasibility prototypes, consisted of approximately 2,500 lines of code.  The prototypes provided a demonstration of the WTMD capability but did not include system software and interfaces that would be necessary for a reliable and certifiable WTMD capability in the FAA operational environment.     To the greatest extent possible, the WTMD envisioned implementation will use existing FAA processing and display systems already in service in the air traffic control tower (ATCT) environment at the candidate airports.  The envisioned system will ingest ASOS and RUC data through existing FAA interfaces.  It will utilize a COTS stand-alone processor or integrate WTMD functionality into the processing capabilities of an existing FAA system.  The envisioned WTMD system will interface to existing Tower supervisor and local controller displays in the air traffic control tower (ATCT) for display of WTMD information to the users and for input of WTMD system control commands.  The envisioned WTMD system will communicate to the ATC supervisor when an opportunity exists to use reduced wake separations for CSPR departure operations.  Should the ATC supervisor chose to utilize the WTMD procedures, specific authorization of the WTMD procedure will be provided to each impacted local controller.  WTMD system will sound a audible alarm in the air traffic control tower if internal WTMD system monitors detect an abnormal shutdown is required.  Air traffic controller training, technician training and WTMD system maintenance tools will be developed.   A means to certify the WTMD decision support tool information presented to controllers must also be developed.
The FAA plans to conduct a full and open competition for this procurement.  The procurement will include operational systems and appropriate spares for the ten candidate airports listed above plus three support systems for training, second level engineering, and testing.  The FAA envisions the WTMD development, test, installation, and operational checkout will require 4 years.  In addition, a sustaining Software Engineering Environment will be required in order to allow the FAA to perform software maintenance.  The contractor will be required to provide any unique software components that will be needed to certify and maintain the system.  The envisioned production and installation of the WTMD capability will include vendor deployment support and preparation of site adaptation data.  The envisioned maintenance concept includes Interim Contractor Depot Level Support (ICDLS) for two years following the last operational system's Contract Acceptance Inspection (CAI) to be followed by organic FAA maintenance.


What the FAA Wants to Know:
1.	Industry's level of interest in participating in this procurement as either a prime contractor or subcontractor.2.	Industry's capabilities for supporting this procurement.3.	Existing and near term technologies that could be applied to this procurement.4.	Suggested technical solutions that could be compliant with the NAS Architecture,  and FAA Orders, 5.	Pros and cons of suggested technical solutions.6.	Timeline and rough-order -magnitude estimate for developing, implementing, and supporting the WTMD capability 
Considerations:  The FAA has no preconceived ideas or expectations regarding what solutions will be offered by the vendor community.  Innovation is encouraged.  However, in today's FAA information technology environment, the following should be considered when offering solutions:
	Standards and protocols sanctioned by existing FAA NAS Architecture 6.0
	FAA Orders, Standards, and Policies
Next Steps:  Interested vendors must submit a white paper no more 15 pages in length addressing the following areas:
	A brief overview of the issues associated with implementing and integrating the WTMD capability into the FAA airport infrastructure as anticipated by the vendor
	A description of the vendor's proposed WTMD solution including the processes, automation and products the vendor will use to develop the WTMD capability and integrate it into the FAA infrastructure
	An explanation of what capabilities the vendor and its teammates have to implement the proposed solution within the identified Time Line
	An assessment of risks (both those within the vendor's control and those outside the vendor's control) inherent in the proposed solution
	Consideration of what performance-based contract measures and metrics are appropriate
	ROM cost, schedule, and risks associated with any technical solution options.
All responses must consider safety provisions, as stated within the FAA publication 'Safety Risk Management Guidance for System Acquisitions' (ATO-S 2006-1, Version 1.4a).  This document can be found at the following website:http://fast.faa.gov/toolsets/SafMgmt/indexstart.htm 
Information obtained from the white paper will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for the WTMD capability.  Questions concerning the white paper submission should be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer Curtis.Fields@faa.gov no later than noon (ET) July 17, 2008.  Although the page limitation is somewhat constraining in nature, it is necessary in order to control the volume of material submitted.  All vendors are therefore highly encouraged to be as accurate and insightful as possible in your responses.  Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey / Request for Information may be requested to provide additional information or invited to meet with the Government for additional discussions at the discretion of the Government.  
No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA.  All interested vendors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any submission received from industry in response to this Market Survey / Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey / Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Submission of proprietary information, although not prohibited, is discouraged.  Any proprietary information submitted must be clearly marked.  The interested vendors should also complete the attached Business Declaration Form, provided as Attachment A, along with their submission. The Business Declaration Form will not be included in the 15-page white paper limitation.  Interested vendors should also redline Attachment B, Program Requirements for WTMD System and return it along with the white paper submission.
Public Website:  In order to facilitate vendors with particular expertise, the opportunity to interact with other vendors, the FAA will maintain on its public website a list of interested vendors and their capabilities.  Vendors interested in being placed on the website should fill out and return Attachment C, Website Release Authorization Form, along with your submission.  
FAILURE TO NOT BE ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATON OR CHOSEN FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WILL NOT PRECLUDE A VENDOR FROM SUBMITTING A RESPONSE TO A FUTURE SOLICITATION.
All submissions are to be received no later than noon (ET) July 31, 2008, by the Contracting Officer either by email to Curtis.Fields @faa.gov or by FedEx at:

<DESC>To: All Recipients of the prospectus, EVER002-08; a concessions business opportunity for interpretive boat tours, retail, and other visitor services at the Flaming and Gulf Coast districts of Everglades National Park-Question and Aswers from site visits May 27 and 28th 2008.
Question 1.May we receive the Current Concessioners' reported 2007 gross receipts for Flamingo and Gulf Coast, which gives us the information contained within the Historical Revenue Breakdown schedules in Exhibit 21 and Exhibit 22 in the Business Opportunity section of the prospectus?NPS RESPONSE:   The current Flamingo Concessioner's reported gross receipts for 2007 were $1,133,213.  The current Gulf Coast Concessioner's reported gross receipts for 2007 were $1,331,961.   Question 2. May we receive the breakdown of Utility Costs (other than water) for the Current Concessioners (Flamingo and Gulf Coast) for the most recent year available (e.g. fiscal year 2007 or 2006)?NPS RESPONSE:  Specific Concessioner Utility costs for prior years are not available. 
Question 3. Where does the Gulf Coast Operation dispose of effluent from the tour boats?
NPS RESPONSE:  Effluent from the vessels utilized at Gulf Coast is disposed of at a NPS operated pump out station at the marina basin.  The Concessioner will not be charged for this service.
Question 4.Will the Concessioner have the latitude of changing fuel prices without going through the Service's formal rate approval process?
NPS RESPONSE:  The NPS Rate Approval guide was provided to all Offerors as Appendix E of the Prospectus.  The National Park Service is required by law to approve all rates charged to the public by Concessioners and to ensure that those rates are comparable to similar goods and services provided outside of the park.   The Concessioner is responsible for providing documentation to justify the rate increase. The National Park Service will make every effort to respond quickly to these rate requests.  The National Park Service is currently researching how the private sector is handling rapidly changing fuel costs for services.  


Question 5Due to the volatility of Fuel cost, are there separate rate approval procedures for fuel, and what would those procedures be?
NPS RESPONSEPlease see the NPS Response to Question number 4 above.
Question 6Can we obtain the detail of Exhibit 23, Future Revenue Estimates?
NPS RESPONSEThe National Park Service conducted its own analysis of the financial feasibility of the potential opportunity.  The National Park Service does not release this analysis to the public as they contain, among other things, certain confidential business and commercial information and reflects the internal deliberations of the agency. Offerors are responsible for producing their own prospective financial analyses and may not rely on the Service projections. 
Question 7.What were the calculations for Exhibit 23, Future Revenue Estimates?
NPS RESPONSEPlease see the response to Question 6 above.
Question 8Regarding the TIKI bar at Flamingo, is the Service anticipating a full bar, or beer and wine only?
NPS RESPONSEThe revenue and expense projections for the Tiki bar at Flamingo are based on a full service (i.e. including liquor) bar.
Question 9What are the current rates NPS will charge the contractor for water, sewer, electric, natural gas, propane, etc. at both locations?
NPS RESPONSEPage 23 of the Business Opportunity discusses the utilities provided by the National Park Service at Flamingo.  Additionally, Utility Responsibilities are discussed in Exhibit A (Operating Plan, sections 3A and 3B).  The concessioner is responsible for contracting with outside entities for electrical and telephone services at Gulf Coast and Flamingo and for propane at Flamingo.  Natural gas is not available at either location.  As the Business Opportunity and Operating Plan state, the Service provides water and sewer service at Flamingo.  The most current rate is $12.63 per 1000 gallons. This rate will be updated in October 2008; however, the increase will not exceed 25%.  Water and sewer costs for the current concessioner's operation over the past season (approximately end of November 2007 through April 2008) have varied from $400.00 to $600.00 per month.  
Water and sewer service at Gulf Coast is provided by the city of Everglades City and billed directly to NPS.  The current concessioner uses a small amount of this water for washing vessels.  There is no charge for this water use at this time. As noted in Exhibit A, section 3B (3) (b), however, the Service may, at its discretion, separately meter the water used by the new concessioner and charge for this use.
Question 10Which utilities are provided by NPS and charged to the contractor and which utilities does the contractor procure for both locations?
NPS RESPONSE:  Please see the NPS response to this question above. Question 11Is swimming allowed at Flamingo?
NPS RESPONSE:   Park regulations state that "Swimming or bathing is prohibited in all canals, ponds, fresh water lakes, marked channels, and boat basins."
Question 12Do the tides have an impact on operations as far as docks and boating routes?NPS RESPONSETides at Flamingo are subject to changes due to weather as are all tides.  However, generally, the impacts of tide changes have limited effects on operations. These effects are most likely to occur, but are not limited to, the period from late February to March when a southwest wind can drain Florida Bay to a level lower than normal. However this period could be longer or shorter depending on weather circumstances.  The effects of tides are most noticeable in the case of sailing tour boats, which ride lower in the water than vessels without a keel, and on rental of dock slips b/c when the tide is lower than normal large vessels may not be able to access the docks.  Tides do not affect the Gulf Coast operations as they are currently structured.  


Question 13Please provide a copy of current subcontracts for services that are in place.  If not available, please list the current providers of subcontracted services and the services they provide at both locations. 
NPS RESPONSEFlamingo is the only area where subcontracted visitor services have been provided.  These included chartered fishing, sailboat tours, and supply and maintenance of kayaks.  Copies of the contracts between these suppliers and the Existing Flamingo Concessioner are not available; however, the operators were Dean Steffen and Neal Baro (chartered fishing; Rob Temple (sailboat tours); and Florida Bay Outfitters (kayaks). However, per Section 17 (c) of the draft Contract, subconcession or other third party agreements, including management agreements, for the provision of visitor services required and/or authorized under the Contract are not permitted. Question 14Are businesses, other than by subcontract with the concessionaire, allowed to provide   their services at either location?  For example, launching kayak tours, or picking up kayak patrons, other than those of the concessionaire?NPS RESPONSEAs set forth in Appendices A and B to the Prospectus, current law and regulations do not permit any concessioner to have an exclusive right to provide services; however, the Service does not anticipate any other concessions during the term of this Contract for the services covered by this Prospectus.   However, commercial use authorizations (CUAs) are allowed.  Currently, CUA holders provide guided canoe trips within the Park at both Flamingo and Gulf Coast; however, these trips start outside the Park. A number of charter boat captains also provide guided fishing trips, which also start outside of the Park. As noted in the response to question number five above, subconcession or other third party agreements, including management agreements, for the provision of visitor services required and/or authorized under this Contract are not permitted.Question 15The prospectus has identified that the National Park Service owns the existing boat, Pelican, which is kept at Flamingo District.  Is this boat available for use by the new concessioner?NPS RESPONSE:Contract Exhibit D (Assigned Government Personal Property) lists the Pelican on page D-2 as assigned to the concessioner at Flamingo.  
Question 16The area behind the Gulf Coast District offices is a likely place for storage of canoes and kayaks.  If this space is available, how would the concessioner get these personal watercraft from this storage area to the launch point with the back gate and maintenance building seeming to block access?
NPS RESPONSEAfter further research, the Service has determined that a change is needed to the Gulf Coast District land assignment map which will change the location for canoe/kayak storage.   The changed map will be provided as an errata to the EVER002-08 Prospectus.
Question 17How many canoes are rented at the 9-mile Pond during the months of December through April, and May through November?
NPS RESPONSEThe existing Flamingo Concessioner does not record their canoe rentals by location.  The Concessioner rents a combination of 9-mile Pond, Back Country and Bay Side locations by the hour, half day and full day.  During December, January, February, March and April of 2007 the existing Flamingo Concessioner rented 2,239 canoes in the Flamingo District.  For May, June, July, August, September, October and November they rented 701 canoes.  Question 18What point-of-sale system is in use in the Flamingo District?
NPS RESPONSEThe existing Flamingo Concessioner uses a Logicel POS32 point of sale system.
Question 19Can the National Park Service provide the utility costs for Flamingo District?
NPS RESPONSESpecific Concessioner Utility costs for prior years are not available. Question 20Can any of the existing Flamingo District buildings that are now closed be used for storage or other purposes if the new concessioner were to fix them up?
NPS RESPONSEAll of the real property improvements assigned to the Concessioner are identified on page C-1 of Exhibit C.    
Question 21Is it possible that the "left-over" merchandise at Flamingo District is out of date or beyond its useful life span?  If so, is the new concessioner required to purchase these items and if so, how can the new concessioner dispose of materials that were purchased. 
NPS RESPONSEThe Business Opportunity, page 25 under Merchandise Inventory, states that Section 12 of the existing contracts requires the new Concessioner to purchase the existing merchandise inventory from the existing Concessioner.  The process for purchasing this inventory is outlined in the existing contracts, which are included as Appendix I, and included in the CD that accompanies the Prospectus. 
Question 22Will the concessioner be required to maintain the National Park Service-owned personal property at Flamingo District?  
NPS RESPONSESection 8. (e) (2) of the Draft Contract states,  "The Concessioner shall be accountable to the Director for the government personal property assigned to it and shall be responsible for maintaining the property as necessary to keep it in good and operable condition."

Formal responses will be posted as Amendments in FedBizOpps.   
 
Attendance at the site survey/preproposal conference is non-mandatory. However, offerors who do not attend the site survey/preproposal conference may find themselves at a disadvantage when proposing compared to those offerors who have attended the conference/site survey and have visually seen and inspected the site(s). The Government shall not be responsible for an offerors potential disadvantage for non-attendance and shall not provide non-attendees with any more information than was supplied to attendees. 
 
You are responsible for all your travel arrangements at no cost to the Government.  Lodging is available in either Belize City or Belmopan.  There are local restaurants in Belmopan.  Rental vehicles are available in Belize City.  The U.S. Embassy is approximately an hour drive from Belize City to Belmopan.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on behalf of and as an agent of the Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified ventilators to be a necessity for pandemic flu preparedness and response.  The purpose of this solicitation is to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for portable ventilators (all same make and model) with delivery to stockpile location(s) in support of pandemic flu preparedness and response.  Resulting awardee shall also be capable of providing re-supply kits, along with end-user training and sustain a 60-month (five year) maintenance support agreement that will include rotation of approximately one third of the ventilators shipping from Government location to offerors location for annual preventative and recertification maintenance.  The objective is to insure availability and consistency of product for stockpile and if need be, deployment in the event of pandemic flu outbreak.  The base contract period will be for one year (or less, depending on date of award), with one (4) option periods that may be exercised by the Government.   It is the Governments desire that the contractor shall provide consistent deliveries of portable ventilators and re-supply kits within an 18-month period.  Offerors are requested to propose a delivery schedule that can be accomplished within this timeframe or sooner and if not within this timeframe, include appropriate reasons why not.  Delivery shall be within the continental United States.  NOTE: Due to the national security and sensitive aspects of this program, information such as final delivery location(s) and point of contact(s) are considered confidential and as such shall only be disclosed to the resultant awardee.  Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of this procurement the contractor and affiliates shall be required to complete a confidentiality agreement within five (5) days of award.  Offeror must be able to provide standard commercial warranty term of at least one year after date of shipment as part of the mandatory characteristics (minimum requirements).  Because of the uniqueness of the DSNS stockpile program and this related procurement, the Government desires a warranty term that would begin at the point of 1st deployment of ventilators and continue through one year.  Offerors are encouraged to consider this optional characteristic provision and to include their response to this provision in the business proposal.  This provision as it is offered will be included in the price analysis portion of the evaluation.  Distributors/dealers are required to submit a letter from the manufacturer/s of the offered portable ventilators guaranteeing a source of supply for the term of the contract.  This letter must be from the manufacturer and on the manufacturers stationary.  Offers from distributors/dealers that do not submit the letter of commitment from the manufacturer will be rejected.
