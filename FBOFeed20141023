<a href="mailto:theresa.i.boutchyard.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>DLA Land Aberdeen is soliciting for proposals for the procurement/fabrication of (Removable) self-contained Canopy Kits, NSN 4940-00-937-2553, CW-924/G, PPL #10482. <br>  <br> This removable canopy is used to cover/shroud a tactical assemblage that is housed inside a S-280 Shelter. The S-280 Shelter is approximately 12'X6'X7' and is normally transported on a 2 1/2 or 5 ton vehicle. The removable canopy provides a sun shield to the exterior roof/sides of the shelter when military units are deployed in locations of extreme high temperatures. It keeps the direct rays of the sun from contacting the aluminum skin surface of the shelter, thereby allowing the air conditioners to efficiently maintain the shelter interior temperature at an acceptable range for soldier operation/performance. The technical data package for this kit is specified/described via fully-detailed drawings. This kit is comprised of several (corner/side) aluminum bracket assemblies (which can either be welded together or these components may be casted instead), lanyard assemblies, rivnuts, screws, washers, sealant, and the 3-piece canopy which is cloth-laminated, vinyl-nylon high strength material. One side of each canopy is a  quote mark GREEN 383 quote mark  color, and the reverse side is  quote mark TAN 686 quote mark  color, to allow the canopy to match the camouflage color scheme of the deployed environment.  <br>  <br> You are not required to install any rivnuts on shelters, the rivnut installation drawings contained in the technical data package are provided for the installer of the Canopy Kit, as I said, which will be soldiers in a General/Direct Support Shop, or installation will be performed at a depot.  These rivnut installation drawings are  quote mark not quote mark  for you (the bidder/contractor) to install. <br>  <br> This contract action is to be a 5 year, firm fixed price (FFP), Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The estimated annual demand for the item is 100 units/year.  The proposed action is expected to be a 100% small-business set-aside.  Multiple contracts may be awarded.  Contract ceiling for any/all awards combined would be $1,600,000. <br>  <br> It is anticipated that the solicitation will be released on or about November 6, 2014 with proposals due approximately 30 days later. <br>  <br> All parties interested in doing business with Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) (ACC - APG (C4ISR)) and DLA Land at Aberdeen are invited to access the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi?ASFI_FAQ.cfm.

<DESC>This Market Survey is issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of new replacement antennas for an estimated quantity of 50 High Gain Open Planar Array (HGOPA) Beacon Antennas which are approaching their end of life.  The Beacon Antenna replacement candidate should be based on an existing product and a customized mounting kit.  The mounting kit is for mounting the array above an existing FAA primary radar antenna sail to transmit and receive beacon signals with the FAA ASR-9 radar system.  

The purpose of this Market Survey is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists and to determine the feasibility for small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.


This requirement is a Service Life Extension Project designed to ensure that the radar system has enough spare parts to cover expected maintenance until at least 2028.  See Attachment (1) for technical specifications of the antenna.  

The specification contained in Attachment (2) is notional only.  The HGOPA referenced herein is intended to operate in the Terminal environment mounted on ASR-9 and/or ASR-8 primary antennas that are not enclosed in radomes.


The Government anticipates the need for two (2) antennas in 2015, twelve (12) in 2016, eighteen (18) in 2017, and eighteen (18) in 2018.


The principle North American Industry Classification System code for this effort is 334511, "Air Traffic Control Radar Systems and Equipment Manufacturing.


The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time; however, either an unrestricted competition or a set-aside will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey.  

Accordingly, this Market Survey must not be construed as either a promise to award a contract or an obligation for the Government to provide compensation for information associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries addressing this Market Survey.   All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the FAA. The FAA reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation for the integration of submarine based Information Technology (IT) systems to support Program Executive Office Submarine's (PEO SUB) integration of combat systems on new construction and in-service submarines. Modern submarine combat system components are acquired by a diverse group of Government and private party (shipbuilder) organizations from a variety of electronics suppliers, and must be integrated to produce a fully functional, effective, and suitable multi-mission warship. Starting with the inception of the first open system networked combat system for the VIRGINIA Class SSN, PEO SUB has outsourced System Engineering &amp; Integration (SE&amp;I) to industry. PEO SUB has a continued need for this work scope which has been expanded to include all classes of submarines. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The effort consists of the integration of large, complex, software intensive Information Technology (IT) systems. Large, complex, software intensive networked systems contain the following: millions of lines of software, multiple operating systems, hundreds of servers, COTS &amp; custom electronics, open systems middleware, all information bearing data types (analog, digital, optical, RF, video), high quality of service (QOS) architecture supporting safety of flight interface and weapons systems compatibility, defensive cyber attack measures, and purposely designed operator maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">SE&amp;I is required to support PEO SUB acquisition and delivery of new construction submarines (Virginia SSN and OR SSBN) and modernization of the existing fleet of ships (SSN688, SSN688I, SSN21, SSGN, SSBN, and in-service SSN774 class). The scope of integration effort required is proportional to the number of different combat system configurations undergoing change spanning the 5 year period of performance of this contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The SE&amp;I agent shall be charged with the responsibility to maintain a systems engineering perspective of the over-arching submarine warfare suite of sensors, electronics, and weapons. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This perspective includes both System of Systems effectiveness and Systems of Systems suitability, independent of mission area or class of ship. During execution of any tasking performed under this contract, the SE&amp;I agent shall consider all technical, logistical, and certification aspects associated with delivery of an operational configuration. This encompasses a wholly engineered configuration considering technical performance, human factors associated with network operation, security, administration, and compliance with applicable regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">NAVSEA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 17, 2014. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Proposals will be due sixty days after issuance of the RFP. The contract is intended to be awarded as a base year plus four option years. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<ARCHDATE>08152014

<DESC>SYNOPSIS for Sole Source License Maintenance Renewals for IBM's Maximo Asset Management, Maximo Asset Management Limited, and Maximo Adapter for Microsoft Project
<p>This procurement is in support of the NSWC Corona Division, Force Training Assessment Department, Combined Tactical Training Ranges (CTTR) Information Enterprise Management System (IEMS). The procurement consists of license maintenance fees for existing software used by the CTTR. License maintenance fees are for enterprise applications used by the CTTR for maintenance management and business processes. The license fees are for IBM Maximo Asset Management, Maximo Asset Management Limited, and Maximo Adapter for Microsoft Project. Each of these license maintenance agreements are renewed yearly.</p>
<p>The impact if the license maintenance were not renewed would be an impact on competent management of the IEMS system and users. The enterprise applications are complex software that require support from the original vendor for failures, corruption of data files, software fixes, patches, and application upgrades. These maintenance agreements are crucial for the continuing use of these applications, and the management of the system by developers and administrators. The loss of the IEMS capability would have a large impact on the data management of operation and maintenance trends and most likely future funding that supports Navy training.</p>
<p>Through the Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) established in 1998 by the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense, the Government has a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with immix Technology, Inc. to provide IBM Software product licenses and maintenance to DoD agencies. Based on this BPA only one source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed price contract to immix Technology, Inc. McLean, VA 22102 who is the required source for IBM based on the ESI stated above.</p>
<p>This requirement will be awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).</p>
<p>This procurement is for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 12. The associated NAICS Classification is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation will be issued but responsible sources may submit a capability statement that indicates their ability to satisfy this requirement, proposal or quotation. Requests must include company name, address, point of contact name, telephone number, fax number, county, CAGE Code, DUNS number, NAICS code, applicable business size, and Tax ID number. Interested parties may submit inquiries or requests for information to the Contract Specialist, Pamela Jarrett, at pamela.jarrett@navy.mil.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with COMSOL for Multiphysics Software under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedure under NAICS Code 511210 Software Publishers. The purpose of this acquisition is to procure software for the evaluation and development of particulate matter (PM) mass sampling instrumentation. These instruments and methods are for measuring PM mass emissions from mobile sources. These instruments include (but are not limited to) the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), Exhaust Flow Meter (EFM), the Micro-Proportional Dilution System (MPS) System, dynamometer based constant volume sampling (CVS), and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PFTE) filter system. The software required for particulate matter sampling shall be evaluated in accordance with its ability to meet the following specifications:
1)	Computer code's ability to model the physics and chemistry taking place during the sampling of particulate matter mass from the exhaust of spark and compression ignition internal combustion engines; sampling systems include: a)	Dynamometer Constant volume sampling (CVS) systems [e.g., Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Protection of the Environment, Parts 86.208 through 86.214, National Archives and Records Administration, Office of the Federal Register, Washington, D.C.; http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=%2Findex.tpl] b)	Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters c)	Proportional sampling systems [e.g., J.E.Brockmann, B.Y.H.Liu, and P.H.McMurry,  ?A Sample Extraction Diluter for Ultrafine Aerosol Sampling?, Aerosol Science and Technology, 3:4, 441 -451(1984)] d)	Quartz crystal microbalance [e.g., J.G.Olin, G.J.Sem, and D.L.Christenson, Piezoelectric-Electrostatic Aerosol Mass Concentration Monitor, American Industrial Hygiene Assoc J 32(4):791-800 (1971); D.A.Lundgren, L.D.Carter, and P.S.Daley, Aerosol Mass Measurement Using Piezoelectric Crystal Sensors, Fine Particles, Aerosol Generation, Measurement, Sampling, & Analysis, BYH Liu editor, pp486-510, Academic Press, NY (1976); G.Sauerbrey, Z. Phys., 155, 1959, pp. 206-222.] e)	Particle size limiting cyclone
2)	Physics and Multi-physics capabilities a)	fluid dynamics i)	material transport (diffusion and convection) ii)	multi-chemical species transport iii)	multi phase flow iv)	porous media flow v)	electrokinetics b)	heat transfer (convection, diffusion, and conduction) c)	chemical engineering i)	surface chemistry ii)	reactions during dilute sampling and transport of multicomponent fluids d)	piezoelectricity e)	acoustics f)	electro-statics and dynamics g)	electro-fluid interactions h)	electro-thermal interactions i)	fluid-chemical reactions j)	fluid-thermal interactions k)	materials library
3)	Chemical reaction dynamics including but not limited to a)	chemical interactions of combustion aerosols from spark and compression ignition engines (diesel and gasoline fuels) with ambient air constituents and combustion exhaust chemical constituents b)	sampling of mobile source air toxics (e.g., http://www.epa.gov/otaq/toxics.htm)
4)	Computational capabilities a)	Meshing b)	Optimization c)	Multiple numerical solution techniques
5)	Minimum requirements for user interface tools a)	User friendly information management tools i)	data input tools (1)	CAD including SolidWorks (2)	Drawing tools (3)	C, FORTRAN, Matlab, and Simulink (4)	edit and/or add to the equations underlying the physics and chemistry ii)	project build or assembly tools iii)	data reporting tools (1)	animation (2)	2-D and 3-D plots with and without problem geometry (a)	User definable scales (w/o color, axes, variables, ) (3)	data files (text and graphical) iv)	comprehensive materials library
6)	Hardware compatibility and requirements Run on a dual processor (1.6Ghz), 4 gb ram, 500 gb hard drive within a reasonable time (CPU time in the range of 10's of hours at most.) The nature of this acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of obtaining and working with Multiphysics Software.  Comsol is the only known vendor capable of meeting all our software requirements.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required software or equivalent may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Point of Contact via FedConnect within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Gerold Young II via Fedconnect.net or  email young.gerold@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

I.	GENERAL DESCRIPTION: This publication is a formal Request for Information whereby   interested firms shall submit a formal SF-330 package.  The resultant contract shall require the firm to provide architectural design/engineering (A/E) services and construction period services for the construction of two new stand-alone GREEN HOUSE nursing homes (approximately 8,566 SF each) accommodating approximately ten Community Living Center (CLC) residents per home at the Tomah VA Medical Center in Tomah, WI.  These units will be constructed on a site adjacent to, and back to back, with the two similar CLC units recently constructed.  The new homes shall be similar in layout and floor plan to the adjacent CLC homes completed in 2014; minor design modifications may be identified during the different design phases.  In addition to the stand-alone buildings and landscaping, a frontage street with parking, curb/gutter, and sidewalk is needed for access to the front of the homes.  Also, the A/E shall provide all necessary site investigation and planning to ensure the site is fully developed to complete the User requirements.  All services related to the Statement of Work (SOW) shall meet codes and regulations for local, state, federal, VA, VISN, ADA, NFPA, Life safety codes, environmental, and archeological preservation.

The A/E will develop standard construction documents for bidding and construction by a qualifying general contractor.  The A/E firm will also provide construction administration.  There will be three submissions.  First at the end of schematic design (35%); second at design development (65%); and last at construction document completion (100%).

IAW VAAR Clause 836.606-73 and the Brooks Act, the total cost of the architect and engineering design services must not exceed 6% of the estimated cost of the construction phase of the project, plus any fees for related services and activities such as investigative services, specialty consultant services, travel costs other than those directly related to the development of construction documents, reproducing design drawings and specification for the construction solicitation phase.

The magnitude of the design phase of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The magnitude of the resulting construction portion of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

II.	SCOPE OF WORK:

A.	This project will construct two stand-alone, ten-bed, one-story CLC homes.  

B.	This project will also involve the installation and/or extension of mechanical, IT, electrical, plumbing, sanitary, and storm systems as necessary to serve the new buildings.  Systems shall be similar to the recently constructed CLC homes.

Note that, if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value.

NOTE: This clause is consistent with customary commercial practice in that it provides a point of contact to foster communication between buyers and sellers. The primary function of the ombudsman is to hear concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. Similar functions are performed by a commercial entity's customer service representative(s) or activity. Inclusion of this clause provides a benefit to commercial entities and does not levy upon them any requirement that is inconsistent with commercial practice.</p>

L. 112-74)</p>
<p>DFARS 252.225-7002, Qualifying Country Sources as Subcontractors (Apr 2003) - As prescribed in DFARS 225.1101(3), this clause is used when the clause at DFARS 225.7001 is included. DFARS 225.7001 is included to implement 41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d, EO 10582, as checked in the clause at DFARS 252.212-7001.</p>

<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the multifunctional waveform generators, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) ... (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention: All potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions:</p>
<p>1. Name of Country where the item is manufactured.<br />2. Describe briefly the capabilities of your facility and the nature of the services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.<br />3. Describe your company's past experience on previous projects similar in complexity to this requirement.

Describe your company's capabilities for generating, handling, processing and storing technical reports.<br />6. Describe your company's capabilities and experience in providing statistical, technical test &amp; evaluation support to identified acquisition programs. Identify what software programs are utilized to generate these data products and what formats are available for delivered items.<br />7. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?<br />8. Describe your capabilities and experience in managing website content projects and development of tracking databases, including subcontractor involvement. Include any experience in project planning, work breakdown structures, resource allocations, schedule tracking, risk analysis and cost management.<br />9. Are there established market prices for our requirement?

Any and all feedback to this Request for Information (RFI) will be appreciated.  Following this initial feedback, NASA may conduct one-on-one meetings with RFI respondents.  These meetings will allow for exchange of information and will provide an opportunity for potential offerors to provide feedback on the Governments requirements and its acquisition approach. <p> Interested offerors/vendors having the capabilities to meet the requirements described in the Draft SOW / RFI are requested to submit a capability statement of 20 pages or less indicating their organizations ability to perform the described technical effort. <P> In addition to a technical response, ARC is soliciting comments and suggestions on contracting approaches to this effort that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities (not included in the 20 page limit for technical response).  Therefore, (in a separate document) ARC is requesting feedback in the following areas for consideration during acquisition planning: <P> 1.	Responses shall include the following (as applicable):	name and address of firm, whether your business is large, or any category of small business listed below for NAICS code 541330, and affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners.  Provide a list of relevant work performed in the past five (5) years, including contract type, contract number, technical description and how it is relevant to this work, dollar amount, period of performance, and a customer reference name/ email and telephone number.  Include your firms DUNS and CAGE code that are registered at the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov). 2.	For small businesses that cannot perform the entire scope of effort described in the draft SOW, indicate what portion(s) of this scope your company could perform. 3.	Does the selection of NAICS code 541330 Engineering Services with size standard $15.0 M seem appropriate?  If not, what alternative NAICS code do you suggest, and why? 4.	Please comment on what type of contract structure (firm fixed price vs. cost reimbursement, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) vs. base plus options) provides the best approach for this type of work. 5.	Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product/ service. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. <p> ARC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition for this effort.  The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <P> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. <P> All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  As applicable, NASA may provide Proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.  By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors. <P> No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>     <P> All responses shall be submitted to <a href="mailto:Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov">Marianne.Shelley@nasa.gov </a>  via email, no later than 5:00 pm Pacific Time, November 21, 2014.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) anticipates a requirement for liquid helium on an as-needed basis for a one year base period, and, a minimum of two, but not more than four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The Contractor must furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to supply liquid helium in 30, 60, 100, 250, and 1000 liter, well-maintained, Contractor-owned dewars. Dewar size indicates product capacity of the dewar. The highest volume of dewar usage is 100 liter dewars, followed by 250 liter dewars with some 30 and 60 liter sizes. NIST does not anticipate using more than two 1,000 liter dewars at any one time and with minimal frequency.</p>
<p>The total quantity of liquid helium required is estimated to be between 110,000 and 130,000 liters per year for the base period and each of the option periods, if the option periods are exercised. Purity of the liquid helium shall be a minimum of 99.998%.</p>
<p>It will be required that the Contractor establish a flat monthly rental rate for demurrage charges associated with the Government's use of Contractor-owned dewars.</p>
<p>NIST currently orders twice weekly, on Monday and Wednesday, with deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays before noon Eastern time. It is anticipated that this delivery schedule will be maintained.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.208-8 Required Sources for Helium and Helium Usage Data: Contractors must purchase major helium requirements from Federal helium suppliers (FHS), to the extent that supplies are available. <br />"Federal helium supplier" means a private helium vendor that has an in-kind crude helium sales contract with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and that is on the BLM Amarillo Field Office's Authorized List of Federal Helium Suppliers available via the Internet at http://blm.gov/8pjd.</p>
<p>In September 2014, NIST executed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Bureau of Land Management. Under this MOU, the BLM agreed to allocate (not transfer or sell) in-kind helium to the federal helium supplier that is awarded any competitive contract awarded by NIST, in the month the helium is required to be delivered. The intent of the MOU is to encourage FHSs to respond to solicitations for helium solicited by NIST. Historically, it is believed that FHSs could not respond to solicitations for helium because they were already allocating their other customers and do not receive their allocation of in-kind helium from the BLM until about six months after delivery.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 325120 Industrial Gas Manufacturing, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Small Business Administration has waived the non-manufacturer rule for this NAICS code. The prime contractor must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code, however, the small business does not have to provide the product of a small business manufacturer. The small business does, however, have to provide the product of an FHS.</p>
<p>Interested and responsible parties are requested to email documentation describing their capabilities to carol.wood@nist.gov not later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during market research, then any competitive procurement that resulted would likely be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Documentation must explain all capabilities, including the capability to provide the required helium product and dewars, as well as any other information relevant to your products and/or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name and business size of the company proposing to perform the work;</p>
<p>2. Confirmation that the Contractor is an FHS or has an active business relationship with an FHS;</p>
<p>3. If subcontractors or distributors would be utilized, the name of company(ies), and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address);</p>
<p>4. Confirmation that the identified ordering/delivery time can be met;</p>
<p>5. Confirmation of the maximum number of option periods for which the Contractor could provide a firm-fixed per liter price for helium;</p>
<p>6. Estimated number of dewars that could be made available to fulfill the NIST requirement;</p>
<p>7. Size of the Contractor's truck fleet for delivery of dewars and the number of truck routes currently serviced by that fleet;</p>
<p>8. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>All documentation must be sent to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. E-mail address: CAROL.WOOD@NIST.GOV.</p>
<p>Responses are due not later than Friday, October 31, <br />2014, at 3:30 PM Eastern Time. Email response is acceptable.</p>

This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.<br /><br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code(s) 541311 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, and the Small Business Standard is $7.5 Million, PSC Code M161 Operation of Family Housing Facilities, for Multifamily Property Management and Tenant Relocation and is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements. <br /><br />Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research, provided that the joint agreements conform to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations in Subcontracting.<br /><br />HUD seeks a contractor who shall provide services obtain the services of multifamily property management and tenant relocation with professional expertise in multifamily property management and tenant relocation services for market rate, section 8 and elderly properties. <br /><br />This contract is Nationwide covering the entire United States including Alaska, Hawaii, The Caribbean (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands). The contractor must have the capacity to provide the necessary services, facilities, professional and technical personnel, and all else necessary to manage properties and relocate tenants accordance with the contract. <br /><br />The contractor must have the capacity to provide multiple contract requirements within the same timeframe in differing parts of the contract's jurisdiction.
<p>Please review the&nbsp;General Description of Work and provide your feedback to Christopher Stuart at Christopher.S.Stuart@hud.gov.

<p>HUD has established a process to keep its commitment to provide safe and affordable housing to families in HUD-assisted properties, carrying out various enforcement strategies where there are non-performing property owners and/or management agents. While property takeovers or abatement of Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts would be actions of last resort, such actions and subsequent relocation of tenants may be the appropriate action when owners and management agents are not fulfilling their contractual obligations. Thus, HUD is anticipating that it will continue to need property management and relocation services at multifamily properties where the Department initiates property takeover or enforcement action. However, HUD cannot, since there are so many variables involved, predict with any degree of accuracy how many relocations or properties requiring management services will be needed.<br /><br />Properties assigned under this contract may have significant physical deterioration and/or deferred maintenance issues. Property conditions may require special attention or additional time, such as, scattered sites covering more than a 25 mile radius, high rise buildings, known structural problems, and/or located in high crime areas.</p>

Required services will include: (1) mail, messenger, and fax services; (2) copy/scan services; (3) supply services; (4) records management services; and (5) docketing services. ENRD is one of seven litigating divisions in the Department of Justice. The Division currently employs approximately 622 attorneys and legal support professionals, most of who are stationed in two buildings in the Washington, DC area. ENRD also has field offices in Denver, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Seattle, which may require support services. The administrative support services for ENRD are currently based in the Patrick Henry Office Building (PHB) located at 601 D. Street, NW. This building also currently houses the largest group of Division personnel. Satellite file/mail/fax rooms and copy centers are located in the Robert F. Kennedy MAIN Department of Justice Building (MAIN - 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW) and in ENRD's Denver Field Office (999 18th Street). A satellite file storage warehouse is managed by the administrative support services staff and is located in Landover, MD. The Division's management is housed in the MAIN Justice Building. The PHB lease is coming to an end in 2015, and a new lease for ENRD is being negotiated by the General Services Administration. There is a possibility that ENRD could relocate. If that happens, the contractor may be required to perform some contract tasks within Government space and other tasks at the contractor's facility. The Government anticipates a base period of twelve months for the resultant contract with four additional option periods of one year each for a total period of performance of sixty (60) months. An indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract is anticipated. The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 561110, Office Administrative Services, with a size standard of $7.5 million. This is a market survey for informational purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP). A draft Statement of Work has been included, solely to assist vendors in the preparation of their responses to this market survey. No contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls or other communications about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.

<a href="mailto:angela.beck@va.gov">angela.beck@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking interested sources for a requirement entitled: 

HOME OXYGEN DELIVERY & SERVICE

Veteran Integrated Service Network 23 (V23) currently serves an estimated 4,861 home oxygen patients in a 10-state area with the bulk of the catchment area residing in the states of Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Iowa, and Nebraska.  The Contractor awarded this program requirement will service that entire multi-state area and its home oxygen patients.  The contract period will be a base year plus four option years.

The Home Oxygen Program is a 24 hour/day service, seven days a week and encompasses (i) the delivery and set up of prescribed Home Medical Equipment (HME); (ii) Veteran/caregiver education on services, equipment, basic home safety review, and establishing the schedule for ongoing deliveries (iii) preventive maintenance / inspection's (PMI) for equipment (iv) pick-up and cleaning of equipment when services discontinued (v) providing 24-hour emergency services with the ability to provide services at the VA beneficiary's (Veteran) home with a maximum of 6 hours of a call (most emergency services to be provided within 2 hours of a call) (vi) compliance with standards and regulatory bodies governing home care and oxygen usage such as:
"	American Respiratory Care Foundations for Respiratory Equipment Used in the Home
"	American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) minimum standards specification for electrically powered home care portable ventilators
"	Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
"	Joint Commission Standard for Home Care, current year standard
(vii) Quarterly reports to VA per contract (e.g. incidents reports, infection control, customer service, etc.)

The term "home respiratory care" or "home oxygen therapy" pertains to the provision of home oxygen therapeutic services necessary to assist the eligible Veteran with oxygen in the home setting. Oxygen is a drug and must have a current prescription (minimally renewal is annually) to include necessary equipment and supplies. The program uses a multidisciplinary approach, involving members of Medical Service and Respiratory Therapy, Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS), Contracting, Accounting, and or performance improvement staff for compliance with the Joint Commission (TJC) standards.  There are three primary methods for providing oxygen therapy in the home: (1) Compressed gas, (2) Oxygen concentrators, and (3) Liquid oxygen.  The contract prices together with the Veteran's physical condition, daily activities, and projected liter flow rate will be the determining factors in choosing the most economical delivery system in each case and will be determined by the prescribing VA practitioner.  

The state of North Dakota requires a Respiratory Therapist for the initial set up of home oxygen service; otherwise the program itself does not require Contract staff to have a clinical license as the clinical oversight for Veterans in the home oxygen program is the responsibility of the VA clinical staff.  The Contract staff is expected to have competencies in equipment delivery and set up, PMI, universal precautions (e.g. infection control), etc. as outlined by the contract's scope of work and most current Joint Commission Standards including National Patient Safety Goals.  In addition, the Contractor is expected to adhere to the provisions of Public Law 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and the National Standards to Protect the Privacy and Security of Protected Health Information (PHI).  The contractor is required to be in compliance with all the Joint Commission Standards pertaining to home care for the duration of the contract.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 532291 Home Health Equipment Rental with an associated small business size standard of $32.5 million dollars. 

This sources-sought announcement is used to identify concerns with the capability to accomplish the work.  This is not a solicitation.  Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside/compete this requirement.

Please provide all of the following:

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications. <br>   <br> The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD. <br>  <br> The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.   <br>  <br> All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than October 31, 2014, 12 PM ET to jonathan.m.bauman2.civ@mail.mil.

Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award. <br>  <br> All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned.  <br>  <br> This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.   <br>  <br> If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-444-0197<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-444-0198<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-556-2579<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-444-0212<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-556-2580<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>NSN:			8115-01-556-2581<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported, no other item determined to be ETS at this time.</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 14, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with HOV Services/LASON Systems Incorporated, 11850 Hempstead Highway, Suite 270, Houston, TX 77092. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and related services; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to HOV Services/LASON Systems Incorporated, 11850 Hempstead Highway, Suite 270, Houston, TX 77092 for a one year maintenance agreement for the TurboScan System. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The FBI is responsible for processing known reference samples of Convicted Offenders, Arrestees and Detainees. The Federal DNA Database Unit became operational in December 2000 as the Federal Convicted Offender Program and collects and analyzes DNA samples submitted from around the country as required by the DNA Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, broadened the scope of sample collections from just convicted federal offenders to include federal arrestees, as well as non-U.S. citizen detainees. Under those acts, federal agencies, to include the FBI, are directed by the USAG to collect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested, facing charges, convicted, or from non-United States persons who are detained under the authority of the United States. In order to comply with this legislation and be able to process the exponential increase in samples being submitted to the FBI, the program requires a preventive maintenance agreement to ensure the successful operation and to maintain optimum performance of our optical character recognition software package known as TurboScan 2000 that is provided by HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc. The TurboScan system is used to scan the FD-936 form submitted for DNA sample submissions uploaded to the National DNA Index (NDIS) and is considered a critical system for the FBI.</p>
<p>HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc. is the only provider of this service as they are the sole provider of the TurboScan 2000 software package. HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc. is the only company that will be able to modify the configurations as they are the only company that provides the TurboScan software. HOV Services is also the only provider that is able to respond on-site within a one hour notice.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by HOV Services/LASON Systems, Inc., as no other vendor is capable of providing the TurboScan 2000 software that is needed for direct support of the FBI's mission and respond on-site within a one hour notice.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, October 27, 2014, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov.

<SUBJECT>Intent to award sole source contract for solid waste services, North Cascades NP, WA
<SOLNBR>P15PS00014
<RESPDATE>110714
<CONTACT>Sarah Welch, Contracting Officer, Phone (360) 854-7220, Email sarah_welch@nps.gov
<DESC>The National Park Service, North Cascades NPS Complex, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for collection, transport, and disposal of solid waste from NPS facilities along State Route 20 in Washington. The contract will be for a base year and four option years, with each period running 11/1 to 10/31 of the following calendar year. The justification is presented herein.&nbsp; <br /><br />Responses, comments, and questions regarding this notice should be directed to Sarah Welch, Contracting Officer, at sarah_welch@nps.gov. All responses, comments, and questions received by November 7, 2014, will be considered.
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1): SOLID WASTE COLLECTION, SKAGIT DISTRICT, FY15-FY19</p>
<p>1. Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): The National Park Service (NPS), North Cascades National Park Service Complex, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for solid waste removal in accordance with FAR 13.106-1. The contract will be with Waste Management of Washington, Inc. (WM), for services in the required collection area including NPS facilities at Marblemount, Newhalem, Diablo, and other sites along State Route 20. The estimated value is approximately $24,000 per year. The contract is anticipated to include one base year and four additional option years for a total performance period of five years with estimated total value $120,000. It will be established as a requirements contract, with NPS dictating the required pick-up schedule and WM charging prices per their approved tariff.</p>
<p>2. Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below): _x_Only one responsible source. __Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. __Other.</p>
<p>Explain: Solid waste removal services in the State of Washington are regulated by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC), an agency of the Washington state government. The WUTC regulates solid waste collection companies under Chapter 81.77 RCW (Revised Code of Washington). That statute in pertinent part provides that no person shall engage in the business of hauling solid waste without having first obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the WUTC; commonly called a G certificate. A G certificate authorizes solid waste collection and hauling within a specific geographic territory. Once a certificate is granted, that certificate holder is the exclusive solid waste collection and hauling entity for the territory, unless the WUTC grants another certificate. There is no general exemption in the state law for solid waste collection companies operating under contract with the federal government. Waste Management of Washington, Inc. holds Certificate of Public Convenience G000237 and is the only authorized vendor to provide solid waste removal services in the required collection area in or around Marblemount, Newhalem, Diablo, and other NPS sites along State Route 20.</p>
<p>Federal agencies are required to comply with local and state statutes regarding the collection and transportation of solid waste. This issue was addressed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Parola v. Wineberg, 848 F.2d 956 (9th Circuit 1988). There, the court reviewed the requirement of Section 1601 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6961) and concluded that: RCRA Section 6001 requires federal installations to comply with local arrangements for solid waste collection and disposal, including exclusive collection franchises.<br />This conclusion was based upon language in the Act which states, "All federal agencies and instrumentalities engaged in activity resulting, or which may result, in the disposal or management of solid waste or hazardous waste shall be subject to and comply with federal, state, and local requirements, both substantive and procedural."<br /><br />The WUTC has previously considered this situation at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington. In the consolidated cases of the Applications of Basin Disposal, Inc. (GA-898) and the Bayside Waste and Transfer, Inc. d.b.a. Kennewick Disposal (GA-902), the Commission found that it does, in fact, have such jurisdiction over collection and transportation of solid waste on federal lands.</p>
<p>3. Market Research. Explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest: Market research was conducted to verify the aforementioned facts are accurate. A synopsis and the justification for this action will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.</p>
<p>4. If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies: a. Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b. The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).</p>
<p>Submitted by Alan Schoblom, Project Officer. <br />Approved by Sarah Welch, Contracting Officer, and Rodney Roberson, Assistant Bureau Competition Advocate.</p>

This methodology was provided to the USPTO in FY2010 and 2011 and Mr. Ulrich's unique expertise in this methodology allows the USPTO to continue this work with the patent and trademark businesses.

Proposals without these requested supporting documents shall be determined not acceptable, and therefore no longer be considered for further evaluation and contract award. Price evaluation shall be based on the lowest reasonable, balanced, and overall total evaluated price offered in the proposal. Price will always be an important factor; therefore offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced proposals as each offeror's offered price will be evaluated for reasonableness. The period of performance is for a total of 5&frac12; years to include one (1) base year, plus four (4) 12-month options, and one 6-month extension of services, if all these options are exercised by the Government. Proposed prices shall include itemized line item of service being offered, and pricing or unit prices for each offered line item. Offered prices shall be projected and totaled for the 5&frac12;-year period of performance to arrive at the overall total offered price. Proposed prices shall be fixed-price for each of the base and option years, subject to future economic price adjustments based on increases or decreases in published or otherwise established and regulated television franchise prices. The government reserves the option to increase or decrease the number of TV drops as necessary for the convenience of the Government.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [xx], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government. The reference website is located at http://www.veterinaryservice.army.mil/sources.html. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

Zayo Group, LLC is uniquely positioned to provide this infrastructure service due to the availability of their existing fiber network within the local area which accelerates the delivery timeline by eliminating construction. Utilizing any other telecommunications service provider to provide the maintenance service of the existing fiber routes is not possible as part of the physical fiber is owned by Zayo and no one but Zayo can access the fiber infrastructure. Utilizing fiber cable infrastructure owned by other telecommunications service providers is not cost effective as this would require NIAID procuring and installing new fiber routes to connect NIAID locations to the closest fiber infrastructure of any new provider.  <br />This acquisition will be made in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 "Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and solicitation for commercial Items," as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

    (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
    (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
    (7) The Standard Form 1449.
    (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments
    (9) The specification.
  (t) System for Award Management (SAM).
    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.
  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

  (a) Upon receipt of a notice of protest (as defined in FAR 33.101) or a determination that a protest is likely (see FAR 33.102(d)), the Contracting Officer may, by written order to the Contractor, direct the Contractor to stop performance of the work called for by this contract.  The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.  Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage.  Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either-
    (1) Cancel the stop-work order; or
    (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.
  (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work.  The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-
    (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and
    (2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.
  (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.
  (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.
  (e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause.
  (f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs.  In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

Members of the Government Program Team have already had to readjust their schedules and travel days. The Government has put forth extra efforts to allow for quality proposal submittals.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $4.02 per hour or $160.80 per week or $696.79 per month

VACATION: 3 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service includes the whole span of
continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and
with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same
Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin
Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and
Christmas Day.  A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another
day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)
(See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.


                         ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **

Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage
and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage
rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies
as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of
the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc."  (The
relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties)
contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting
"arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a)
of the regulations.  This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage
rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

<p>The AFTC plays a critical role in developmental test and evaluation (T&amp;E) for AFMC's air and ground systems and is an essential cornerstone to the command's consolidation initiative from 12 centers to five. Headquartered at Edwards AFB, CA, AFTC leads the Air Force's T&amp;E mission, conducting developmental T&amp;E of air, space, and cyber systems to provide timely, objective, and accurate information to decision makers. The AFTC is comprised of the following organizations: 412th TW, Edwards AFB, CA, Arnold Engineering and Development Complex, Arnold AFB, TN, and the 96th TW, Eglin AFB, FL.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Track Two - Small Business Opportunities:</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-013 High Temperature IR Target Simulation</strong></p>
<p>Required to test sensors with a primary mission of observing plume data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These data are from high temperature sources and follow a different black body curve than lower temperature sources.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-015 Calibrate Multi Spectral Projection Sources </strong></p>
<p>Required to calibrate multi spectral projection sources.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-016 Project Multiple Sources In A Radiometrically Correct Spectrum</strong></p>
<p>Modern sensors operate in multiple spectral regions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This source is required to project multiple sources; some possibly extend shapes, across multiple spectral bands at the same time, and in a radiometrically correct spectrum.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-017 Calibrate Multiple Spectral Bands Simultaneous With Projection Of Multiple Specific Narrow Band Line Widths</strong></p>
<p>Modern sensors operate in multiple spectral regions, including IR, visible, and UV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This source is required to precisely calibrate multiple spectral bands at the same time, with simultaneous projection of multiple specific narrow band line widths.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-018 Improve Heat Flow Through Cryovacuum Chambers </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for a cryogenic control valve to improve control of heat flow through cryovacuum chambers to provide the stability needed for efficient testing.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-019 Calibration Testing</strong></p>
<p>There is a need for compact narrow-line tunable source for sensor system responsivity testing. This capability is required to provide very narrow spectral lines, from a user selectable spectrum for precise calibration testing.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-020 Develop Wide Field of View Sensor Array Test Method(s)</strong></p>
<p>Modern wide field of view and large format sensor arrays exceed the physical capability of current test facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A method is required to test these new sensors using existing facilities in new manners to avoid the cost of excessive facility contraction.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-024 Space Simulator Testing</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement to test sensors with a primary mission of observing plume data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This data is from high temperature sources and follow a different black body curve than lower temperature sources.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-025 Sensor Calibration</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for in-band non-blackbody Flood Source for SUT uniformity. This will be used to calibrate sensors uniformity across the entire sensor with a constant illumination (radiometric).</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-027 Project wide and extremely wide fields of view </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for Wide Field of View (&gt;9 deg) and Ludicrously Wide Field of view (&gt;120 deg) sensor test projectors. Modern sensors have wide and extremely wide fields of view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current technology requires large, expensive, dedicated optical systems to fill the field of view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These would be prohibitive for the new generation of Wide Field of View system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This task should develop new technology, possibly using meta materials or other means, to project WFOV scenes without needed large optical trains.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-028 Improved Projection Technology </strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for a large format multispectral scene projector. Current scene projectors are limited to 512x512 or 1024x1024 pixels, while sensor arrays already exceed this by factors of four or more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>New projection technology is needed to test these large and very large format arrays.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-029 Improved Cryogenic Cooling Technology</strong></p>
<p>Current sources us cryogenic fluids, such as liquid helium to cool focal planes to single digit temperatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These systems require bulky and expensive cryogenic plants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement is to develop a solid state cooling technology that is capable of reaching cryogenic temperatures without the use of cryogenic fluids and bulky, mechanical equipment.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-031 Improved High Energy Sources (Space Qualification Testing)</strong></p>
<p>Space qualification testing of electronic components requires high energy sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technology is needed that can provide these higher energies at low cost and high flux rate. There is a requirement for a high flux electron source with an energy range from 10Kev to 1Mev.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-032 Variable High Flux Atomic Oxygen Source</strong></p>
<p>Space qualification testing of materials requires high flux atomic oxygen sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Current technology is limited in the flux rate it can provide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technology is needed that can provide high flux rate atomic oxygen, representing atomic oxygen density at orbits from 89 to 105 minute periods.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-039 Operation of Technical Library </strong></p>
<p>Responsible for Information Technology Equipment, Training, Collection Development, Technical Discussions, Building Manager Responsibilities, Technical Library Operations, Sensitive/Classified Literature and Searches, Process Technical Reports, Requests for Limited Documents, Accountability of Classified Information/Requirements, Technical Reports Publication Support, Access Verification, and operation Collaboration Rooms</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-040 Aircraft Maintenance </strong></p>
<p>Provides on and off-equipment maintenance on 34 aircraft to include F-15, F-16, A-10, C-130 and UH-1N aircraft and assigned engines in support of the 96th Test Wing test missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Aircraft Maintenance Backshop performs modification manufacturing of prototypes, produces aircraft and engine modifications and fabrication, maintains armament systems, provides required supply support, and monitors and ensures compliance with training and environmental programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Provides host base Crash Recovery and Hydrazine response team support.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-041 Flight Line Support</strong></p>
<p>This requirement includes arrival services, foreign garbage support, departure services, aircrew support, end of runway inspections, processing services, transient aircraft safety, transient aircraft carrying munitions, aircraft parking, aircraft inspections, flight line maintenance support, flight line recovery support, and maintenance and support activities</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-045 Towed Airborne Plume Simulator Dynamic Range Improvement </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for a low flow rate pyrophoric fuel valve and control system. The center operates the Towed Airborne Plume Simulator (TAPS), which relies upon the combustion of a pyrophoric fluid to produce signatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current system operates over a flow rate range of 0.2 - 10 cubic inches per sec (cis).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to improve the dynamic range of the system, an additional valve is sought to provide a lower flow rate range: 0.02 - 5 cis preferred, 0.05 - 5 cis acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The design of the current valve is not amenable to simply scaling down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The valve must provide good spray atomization over the entire flow range, and be controllable to 1% of full scale.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-046 Missile Radiometric Signature Development</strong></p>
<p>Infrared signatures for testing aircraft missile warning sensors are currently produced by combustion, as in the Towed Airborne Plume Simulator at AEDC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project aims to produce missile radiometric signatures from LWIR through UV without combustion: perhaps through LEDs, lasers like the QCL, or various other means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the safety and precautions associated with pyrophoric fuel are eliminated, and the signatures can be controlled more precisely and over a wider spectral range.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-047 Improved Missile Attitude Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Missile attitude during the initial second after launch is a key parameter in signature prediction models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To validate these models, missile attitude in all three dimensions must be known within one degree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One current method uses cameras to view the missile as it flies past a patterned background painted in segments and records the angle measured with respect to that background.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, stereo photogrammetry has been used, but current techniques rely on laborious human-in-the-loop target tracking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alternate solutions may be possible.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-048 Thermal Mapping Camera </strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for a single frame, fast integration, thermal mapping camera to study flow effect on scaled models moving at hypersonic speeds in a long test chamber. The temperatures encountered could be up to 2500 degrees C. Integration times as low as 100 &#414;s is desirable.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-049 Hone Very Long Bore Tapers </strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for the ability to hone the bores of very long (130 ft.) straight tubes to both maintain the surface finish and occasionally to adjust the bore size. Standard long tube equipment is built for honing straight bores and is therefore difficult to manipulate through a tapered bore. A computer controlled hydraulic or servo motor operated hone is required that can hone tapers up to 0.1 inch over the 130- ft.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-050 Improved Hydrogen Launcher Cleaner </strong></p>
<p>There is a need for a hydrogen launch cleaner. The current operation involves a very large two stage hydrogen launcher. The first stage of compression in the launcher uses military grade class 3 propellants. This propellant leaves a heavy residue that must be removed from the first 100 feet of the launcher after every operational cycle. The currently available environmentally approved cleaner is ineffective and leaves the bore less clean than required.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-051 Boundary Layer Observation</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for the ability to observe the boundary layer on subscale models moving at hypersonic speeds. The models are launched at the testing speeds into a 1000 ft. long, 10 ft. diameter test chamber where they are observed through acrylic ports.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A high resolution image of the flow phenomena around the model is required to allow the image to be enlarged and interrogated for flow effects like boundary layer transition.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-053 Directed Energy Aero-optic Test Capability for High Speed Testing</strong></p>
<p>There is a requirement for a directed energy aero-optic test capability for high speed testing. Testing aero-optic systems in large high speed wind tunnels provides an opportunity to evaluate full-scale hardware at flight conditions over a wide range of laser deployment angles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The aero-optic effects of the airframe boundary layer and shear layer on the beam can be quantified only if the facility induced jitter can be subtracted out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recent wind tunnel experiments have confirmed the vibration levels of the wind tunnel structure are low and this wind tunnel will be a suitable site for aero-optics testing.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>-054 Quantum Cascade Laser System</strong></p>
<p>A quantum cascade laser system is required for gas diagnostics in systems-under-test (turbine engine, scramjet, rocket, etc.) exhaust as well as vitiated facility flows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are typically high temperature gas streams 1000K+, low to atmospheric pressure, possibly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>laden with combustion by-product gases (CO, CO2, H2O, NO, etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since our test requirements cover a wide range of test conditions, a single wavelength or multiple fixed wavelength diagnostics system is NOT desired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A need exists for a widely tunable (nominally 200 cm-1) laser system of narrow line width (&lt;2 MHZ, for obtaining spectral data on high temperature gases at low pressures) that operates in the mid-infrared spectral region (2-6 microns) capable of rapid mode-hop free operation over a wide spectral range with power of 10mW or higher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally the system will not require cryogens and is (or can be) easily coupled to fiber optics for delivery and retrieval of the transmitted light from test cell that operates in a harsh environment with difficult optical access.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-055 Real-time Radiography system</strong></p>
<p>Real-time Radiography system is in need of rejuvenation or replacement. The X-ray source, while fully capable of meeting current needs, requires refurbishment as well as modernization of its controls and data acquisition system. The system controls must be updated to ensure remote and coordinated operation with the sensors and data acquisition systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system's low level light sensors and associated recording systems need to be upgraded/replaced with state of the art low light level sensors that can work with current state of the art x-ray conversions screens and allow utilization full capabilities of the source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Alternate sensors that operate independent of x-ray screens such as x-ray image sensors or other new technologies will be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mission of this system is to collect real time x-ray scenes at greater than 300 frames per second (synchronized with the x-ray source) of a rocket motor or other articles under test.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">-056 Arc heater segments and module assemblies</strong></p>
<p>Additional suppliers are needed for arc heater segments and module assemblies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A design that will lend itself to manufacture by a wide range of competent machine shops and e-beam welding vendors and a methodology for quality testing of manufactured parts to ensure integrity before insertion into the heaters is required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an ongoing need and the capability will be utilized as soon as available.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES.   <br>      <br>   The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the US Army Product Director Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD-PNT), is conducting a market research to seek information on the state of the art and the ability of industry to support the development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.     <br>      <br>   Background and Description:   <br>      <br>   This Request for Information (RFI) by the Army seeks industry feedback on the latest state of the art position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites and the ability of industry to support development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.    <br>      <br>   GPS Pseudolites are systems that can be deployed terrestrially or near-terrestrially that transmit signals that are similar to GPS Satellite signals. Pseudolite technology has been shown to enable suitably programmed GPS receivers (e.g. software only modifications) to determine their position, velocity and time even under severe electromagnetic interference (jamming). The technology, as demonstrated, has little or no adverse impact on unmodified GPS receivers (military or civilian). The Army plans on deploying pseudolite transmitters on: land vehicles, namely trucks and combat vehicles, and aircraft such as unmanned air vehicles and lighter than air platforms.   <br>      <br>   The technologies sought should be other than Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Sensor technologies. Examples of technologies to consider are: Celestial, terrain matching, geophysical matching, and signals of opportunity. Technological approaches are not limited to these examples. Addressees are encouraged to submit any and all technologies that can be used as a source of own position for GPS Pseudolites.    <br>      <br>   Requested Information:     <br>      <br>   The Government is requesting contractors provide sufficient information in the form of a white paper which demonstrates that the contractor can develop and support this capability.  White papers can address any or all of the above described requirements.  White Papers are limited to 10 pages and should include:   <br>      <br>   1) Description of past performance regarding development and manufacture of the technologies submitted in response to this RFI.    <br>      <br>   2) Approach for providing the technology device or concept.   <br>      <br>   3) Input on the schedule and Rough Order of Magnitude cost that it would take to develop the technology to the point that it can be successfully tested in the field (Technology Readiness Level 5).   <br>      <br>   4) Identify any dependencies or external references the submitted technology requires.    <br>      <br>   5) Name, telephone number, street address and email address for Program, Technical and Cost information.   <br>      <br>   Responses:   <br>      <br>   In addition interested sources are requested to submit a brief summary of capabilities to include in-house capability versus outside resources (i.e. subcontractors/teaming arrangements), and complete the enclosed questionnaire to include information such as company size, past performance information, facility security classification currently held, and pertinent points of contact.   <br>      <br>   All responses shall be unclassified. In order to receive classified or For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, interested parties must provide the following information to the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP):   <br>      <br>   Company Name:   <br>   Company Cage Code:   <br>   Corporate Mailing Address:   <br>   Classified Mailing Address:   <br>   Security Office Information:   <br>   Name/Title:   <br>   Email:   <br>   Phone:   <br>      <br>   All submissions must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font), e-mailed to [contracting office to insert], and [contracting office to insert].

<a href="mailto:jemel.m.hogan.civ@mail.mil">ACC-APG - Edgewood</a>
<DESC>This RFI closing date is extended from 24 October 2014 to 7 November 2014. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Edgewood Division, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010, on behalf of the  Joint Project Manager, Protection (JPM P) is issuing this sources sought announcement as part of a Market Survey to establish a baseline of knowledge within industry relative to the availability of technically mature, production representative Chemical and Biological (CB) protective respirators for use in a broad range of tactical military aircraft that will provide combined protection for CB and gravity induced loss of consciousness (GLOC).  The JPM P wishes to identify potential sources that possess the ability to produce a product that meets the requirements of the Joint Service Aircrew Mask for Tactical Aircraft (JSAM-TA) program.  <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND:  <br>  The JSAM-TA is defined as a system for individual aircrew head/eye respiratory and percutaneous protection against CB warfare agents, radiological particles, continuous protection against CB agent permeation, and protection against selected toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) and toxic industrial materials (TIMs) for sustained operations in the presence of these threats.  When integrated with aircraft-mounted and crew-mounted breathing equipment (in aircraft so equipped), the system will provide combined (simultaneous as required) hypoxia, CB, and anti-G protection.  The JSAM-TA will be a lightweight, flame resistant, protective respirator system that will be compatible with all Air Force Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) and Navy Aircrew Life Support Systems (ALSS).  JSAM-TA will integrate with all applicable aircraft and aircrew systems fielded prior to or concurrent with JSAM TA, including, but not limited to: seating, restraint systems, optical systems, communications systems, aircraft-mounted oxygen systems, survival vests, anti-G systems, and existing personal protective clothing while requiring no aircraft or aircrew equipment modifications.  The JSAM-TA shall incorporate state of the art technology to protect aviation forces from anticipated threats during flight, ground transit and preflight/post-flight aircraft related activities.  <br>    <br>  OBJECTIVES:   <br>  The objective is to identify systems with the capability to meet JSAM-TA protective respirator functional performance.  The breadth and fidelity of available test data is key to this information request.  The JSAM-TA system requirements include in part:     <br>    <br>  [1] The system shall prevent chemical agent permeation (liquid, aerosol, and vapor) for a period of 12 hours {Objective of 24 hours}.   <br>    <br>  [2] The system (in a positive air pressure mode) shall achieve a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 20,000 for the tactical aircrew population against chemical agents {Objective of 120,000} with at least a 0.88 probability with 90 percent confidence.   <br>    <br>  [3] The system (in a positive air pressure mode) shall provide a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 50,000 for the tactical aircrew population against biological agents {Objective of 120,000} with at least a 0.88 probability with 90 percent confidence.  <br>    <br>  [4] The system (in a negative air pressure mode) shall provide a Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF) of 1,667 for the tactical aircrew population against biological agents in the event of positive air pressure or oxygen system failure {Objective of 10,000} with at least a 0.88 probability with 90 percent confidence.  <br>    <br>  [5] The system shall reduce respiratory exposure against Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) using the established parameters of the C2A1 filter.   <br>    <br>  [6] The JSAM will provide an effective mask seal up to 60 mm Hg pressure breathing at G loads up to +9Gz for 15 seconds with a +6Gz per second onset rate when integrated with a pressure breathing for G (PBG) system such as COMBAT EDGE.  <br>    <br>  [7] The system when used in positive pressure breathing for altitude (PBA) applications shall provide automatic mask sealing up to 70 mmHg nominal.  <br>    <br>  [8] The system shall deliver oxygen effectively after a 5.0 psi decompression at +1 Gz up to an altitude of 60,000 feet MSL in 1.0 second and a subsequent descent to 10,000 feet MSL at a peak rate of 10,000 feet per minute.  The decompression-derived pressure spike in the mask cavity shall not exceed 41 mmHg guage during a decompression in the absence of a counter pressure vest.  The decompression-derived pressure spike in the mask cavity shall not exceed 80 mmHg with a counter-pressure vest.  <br>    <br>  [9] The system must be able to survive an ejection with windblast up to 600 KEAS and not injure the aircrew member.  <br>    <br>  [10] The critical viewing area (optical surface) shall have no distortion which would impact safety of flight or prevent normal and emergency operations.   <br>    <br>  [11] The system shall require no aircraft modifications and shall integrate with existing aircrew flight equipment and aircrew life support equipment/systems, optical systems, and standard aircraft oxygen and communication connections.  <br>    <br>  [12] The system shall prevent mist/frost buildup on system optical surfaces during normal and emergency operations such that pilots can accomplish their operational duties.  This shall be accomplished without the use of any topical anti-fog compounds by the user.   <br>    <br>  [13] The system shall permit the wearer to perform a one-handed valsalva (equalization of inner ear pressure via pinching of the nose) maneuver without breaking the CB seal.  This shall be accomplished while the aircrew member is wearing flight gloves and CB protective gloves.   <br>    <br>  [14] The system, when integrated with existing head-mounted personal/life support equipment, shall not degrade hearing protection compared to the non-CB configuration.   <br>    <br>  [15] The system will have an Operational Availability (Ao) of 95% within the threshold 12 hour wear time {Objective of 99%}.  Ao = (Operational Uptime / (Operational Uptime + Operational Downtime)), where Uptime is defined as the respirator being available for immediate use to perform the designated mission for 12 hours minimum.  <br>    <br>  Vendors that can provide an existing product that meets or exceeds the above requirements are invited to submit information for the following areas of interest in a capability statement:   <br>  (1) Product summary/description   <br>  (2) Complete description of technical characteristics  <br>  (3) Capabilities  <br>  (4) Product maturity (e.g: Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) [http://www.dodmrl.com/], is the system fielded to military units?, etc.)  <br>  (5) Photographs, diagrams, drawings  <br>  (6) List of performance verification  <br>  (7) List of any test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) or special tooling that is utilized with the system.   <br>    <br>  The performance verification listing should address, at a minimum, the following:  <br>  (1)	Type of verification  <br>  (2)	Organization that conducted the verification  <br>  (3)	Location and date the verification was conducted  <br>  (4)	Summary of verification results  <br>  (5)	System configuration during verification  <br>  (6)	Any planned/upcoming verification events  <br>    <br>  All test data submitted will be reviewed, but existing data for the following performance verification activities is highly desired:  <br>  (1)	Stimulant Agent Resistance Test Manikin (SMARTMAN)  <br>  (2)	Quantitative Fit Factor (QFF)  <br>  (3)	Windblast [600 +/- 25 knots equivalent airspeed (KEAS)]  <br>  (4)	Altitude/Centrifuge  <br>  (5)	Any aircraft integration data or analysis with PBG capable aircraft  <br>    <br>  In addition, contractors shall state the approximate lead-time for acquiring the product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product.  The name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives should also be included.    <br>    <br>  Responses to this notice should be submitted, as indicated above, and at a minimum, should also include: RFI number W911SR-14-R-AMTA, company name, address, telephone number, Point of Contacts (POCs), facsimile number, website address (if available), and type of business (large or small), cage code, size standard,  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)  code,  informational paper addressing the areas of interest listed above, brochures, technical specifications, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and a listing of Government or 3rd party performance verification.

Source material documents will contain legal, business, contractual, medical, biological research and military terminology and concepts, including those dealing with arms control and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, biological).

Industry Day Briefs and the attendance list was also published.  ******************** Updated Information: 11 August 2014  SPAWARSYSCOM has posted a Draft RFP and attachments to the E-Commerce Website.  The Draft RFP and attachments are specific to this On-Ramp effort. Any interested parties are invited to review all of the documents and provide comments.  The RFP will be covered by the Government in detail at the Industry Day on 15 August 2014.  Any interested parties are STRONGLY encouraged to read the Draft RFP and all attachments in preparation for the Industry Day.  This Draft RFP is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in response to this Draft RFP.  Any information submitted in response to this Draft RFP will become property of the U.S. Government.  ********************************* Updated Information: 01 August 2014  SPAWAR is anticipating release of the final solicitation for the On-Ramp - N00039-14-R-0400 on or about 11 August 2014.  An Industry Day is planned for Friday, 15 August 2014.  Details are listed in the attachment entitled, "N00039-14-R-0400 On-Ramp Industry Day.pdf" which can be found on the SPAWAR E-Commerce website.  ********************************* Original Posting: 09 July 2014  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM) intends to issue a modification to the SPAWAR (PAC/LANT/HQ) GLOBAL C4ISR INSTALLATION CONTRACT (GIC) that will execute a three (3) year extension to the effective ordering period for the current contract.  The effective ordering period of the GIC currently expires on February 9, 2016, and the three-year extension will extend this ordering period through February 9, 2019.  In conjunction with this modification SPAWARSYSCOM intends to solicit new multiple awardees using the "On Ramps" clause in the contract.  SPAWARSYSCOM awarded four (4) multiple award, indefinite-delivery, indefinite- quantity, performance-based service acquisition contracts on 10 February 2011 under Request For Proposal (RFP) number N00039-10-R-0001.  The scope of this multiple award contract includes all afloat (includes ship and submarine) and shore-based C4ISR, and supporting systems, current and future excluding the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI).  The contracts were awarded with one (1) three-year base ordering period and one (1) two-year option ordering period for a total of five (5) years.  This was a full and open competition. The requirement was originally posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website on 7 August 2009.  The following GIC contractors will receive the above-mentioned modification which will extend their effective ordering periods for three (3) years:  AMSEC, LLC: N00039-11-D-0030 Lockheed Martin Services, Inc.: N00039-11-D-0031 Serco, Inc.: N00039-11-D-0032 VT Milcom Inc: N00039-11-D-0033  There will be no increase to the current maximum ordering value of $1.4B or the estimated level of effort, as the current value is considered more than sufficient to cover all future task orders through February 9, 2019.  This contract modification is essential for SPAWARSYSCOM to facilitate the enhancement of the industrial base for C4ISR installations.  In conjunction with this modification, SPAWARSYCOM is also seeking to expand the pool of available resources through the use of the "On-Ramps" clause in the GIC contract, wherein the Contracting Officer will accept and evaluate proposals with the intention of adding new contracts to the GIC in FY2015.  At the time of award of the GIC, SPAWARSYSCOM believed the industrial base to be fully identified as the GIC was a full and open competition.  SPAWARSYSCOM has re-evaluated the industrial base and has decided the best way forward for all parties is to solicit new multiple awardees as allowed by the "On Ramps" clause.  SPAWARSYSCOM believes this will facilitate greater competition at the task order level and bolster the workforce needed to perform the Global C4ISR Installations under the GIC.  As part of the on-ramp feature, all potential sources will have the opportunity to participate in a full and open competition and be awarded a Global C4ISR Installation contract under the new RFP number N00039-14-R-0400.  It should be noted that any new prime contractors added to the GIC will join the four (4) current GIC prime contractors, and that all contractors with a GIC contract award will need to compete in post-award task order competitions for the C4ISR installation work under this contract.  This synopsis shall serve to satisfy the requirements of FAR 5.201 for the new solicitation  N00039-14-R-0400.  SPAWARSYSCOM intends to issue a RFP which would result in up to three (3) multiple award, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), performance- based service acquisition contracts with one (1) four-year base ordering period. This will be a full and open competition.  The estimated level of effort will be 11,786,580 hours.  Although this will be a new solicitation, it is anticipated to utilize the same proposal instructions, evaluation procedures, and attachments as the original Global C4ISR Installation RFP - N00039-10-R-0001, dated 12 July 2010.  The original RFP and all attachments including the Statement of Work and information from the original Industry Day may be obtained from the e-Commerce website at the following address: https://e- commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/ under RFP number N00039-10-R-0001.  Any interested parties are STRONGLY encouraged to read all available information posted with the original RFP.  The Government intends to hold an industry day regarding this new opportunity in August 2014.  All organizations interested in participating in the industry day shall note its desire in its response to this synopsis detailed below. Attendance shall be limited to three (3) representatives per organization (to include any potential subcontractors).  The time, place and location of the industry day will be posted on the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at a later date.  All organizations interested in this Global C4ISR Installation Contract On-Ramp opportunity are invited to submit a response detailing the following information: a) company name, company address, CAGE code, point of contact, e-mail address, and telephone number; b) intent to propose as a prime contractor or a subcontractor; and c) whether the organization intends to participate in the industry day, and the name and employer of each attendee.  No substitutions will be permitted after 23 July 2014.  No reservations for the industry day will be accepted after 23 July 2014.  Any information provided beyond what is specified above will not be considered by the Government.  Responses are requested no later than 23 July 2014 at 4:30 Pacific Standard Time.  Reponses shall be submitted to: Matthew Fleming at matthew.fleming@navy.mil and Chris Thompson at chris.thompson1@navy.mil.  For further information please contact Matthew Fleming at matthew.fleming@navy.mil or Chris Thompson at chris.thompson1@navy.mil  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information submitted in response to this synopsis.  Any information  submitted in response to this synopsis will become property of the U.S. Government.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 11, John Dingell VA Medical Center, Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition to Wayne State University, for MRI services on animals for research. Details included on 2237 transaction # 553-15-1-081-0035.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 

This request is for a new firm-fixed price purchase order for Wayne State University (5700 Cass Ave STE 4900, Detroit, MI 48202, 313-577-3726) to provide use of a specialized small bore high field MRI machine optimized to obtain the highest quality images possible of the rats proposed in the funded study.
 
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

Service to provide use of a specialized small bore high field MRI machine optimized to obtain the highest quality images possible of the rats proposed in the funded study.   The estimated cost is $17,500.00 ($175.00 per hour) for the performance period of November 1,2014 through September 30, 2015.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 

The application for this research was funded to obtain new and important imaging data using specialized small-bore high field MRI scanners at Wayne State University School of Medicine. The only other such MRI scanners are located in Ann Arbor. However, in addition to the increased cost of using the system in Ann Arbor, they would be scientifically unreasonable to use because travel from Detroit to Ann Arbor would introduce unacceptable variables into the experimental design due to increased exposure to noise and possible sample compromise during travel (critical considerations for our studies focused on the auditory system).  All of our preliminary data in our funded proposal, as well as our previous publication on this topic, were collected using the small animal high field MRI at Wayne State University. This makes this Contractor uniquely able to ensure optimal continuity of data collection and interpretation and allow us to take the best advantage of our prior experience with this system.  The 11T MRI scanner in Scott Hall at Wayne State University allows high resolution analysis of the chemical contents of the sample.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 

Market research was conducted, the only other acceptable MRI was located in Ann Arbor and it was deemed impracticable to use the system in Ann Arbor both in terms of expense and experimental design as described in section 5.
 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: 

The rate of $175.00 per hour is fair and reasonable based on the IGCE of $175.00 per hour.  The quote is also deemed fair and reasonable based on acquisition history of 553-D47029 for $30,000 and 553-C30228 for $20,000.00 for similar research services performed by Wayne State University.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted, the only other acceptable MRI was located in Ann Arbor and it was deemed impracticable to use the system in Ann Arbor both in terms of expense and experimental design as described in section 5. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

None. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Wayne State University, 5700 Cass Ave STE 4900, Detroit, MI 48202 313-577-3726.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required: 

Continue to survey the market for all future requirements in an effort to locate other sources for this service.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
