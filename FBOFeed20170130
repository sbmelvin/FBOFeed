<CONTACT>Donald Collie, Phone 3019756458, Email donald.collie@nist.gov - Cory L. Worley, Phone 3019753635, Email cory.worley@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.
<p>Spent irradiated fuel assemblies and regulating rods (shim arms) from the NIST reactor (NBSR) are stored in the NBSR spent fuel pool prior to disposal.  The pool is filled with about 33,000 gallons of water (ASTM Type II demineralized water).  The dimensions of the storage area of the pool are 10 feet wide, 20 feet long and 18 feet deep.  The storage area is serviceable by a 2-ton overhead crane.  The crane has an electric lift but is manually positioned.<br /><br />Fuel and shim arm assemblies are cut into predetermined sized pieces prior to packaging and shipping.  Currently, Reactor Operations uses two saws to perform the cutting, one for fuel assemblies and one for shim arm assemblies.  The saws are stored outside of the pool.  When needed, they are lowered into the pool and connected to their power source (3 phase power and compressed air).  Cutting is cumbersome because the fuel elements and shim arms are stored vertically prior to being cut but must be laid down horizontally in the saw in order to be cut.  Cutting in the proper place is extremely important so that the uranium in the fuel element and the cadmium in the shim arm are not disturbed.  Because of this, proper loading of the saw has to be checked, re-checked and monitored before and during the cutting process.  After the cutting process, the saw has to be cleaned and decontaminated before being returned to its storage place.  The machining debris also has to be collected and stored for disposal.  Some of the debris is collected by the saw's filter but most is scattered on the pool floor and has to be vacuumed up.<br /><br />The objective of this procurement is to simplify this process by having a new saw designed and built that can cut both fuel element and shim arm assemblies in a vertical position; be easily loaded and unloaded; be located permanently in the pool; and be able to contain and collect the machining debris at NIST NSBR in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is NAICS code 541330. The Small Business Size Standard is $15,000,000 in annual receipts. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. Contracting by Negotiation procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposals (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available through the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-17-RP-0009.</p>
<p>A site visit will be included in this solicitation.  Details on the site visit will be posted with the solicitation.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted.  It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to donald.collie@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>Background<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which mission it is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions.<br />Screening is often the starting point in our development and a wealth of knowledge is obtained from screening a diverse collection. It provides the starting point of all information for medicinal chemistry's structure-activity relationship (SAR) design to synthesize novel compounds that have more desirable properties. A diverse and novel screening collection provides the backbone of our operation and is imperative for translation sciences to obtain effective small molecules with on-target effects.<br />These small molecules have been designed around analysis of available chemical and biological information, identification of key pathways modules/targets, computational and "wet biology" assessment of target druggability and potential binding domains. The resulting information is analyzed by synthetic and medicinal chemistry teams in order to bring new chemical diversity and to design unique scaffolds that are likely to interact with the designated targets yielding focused compound libraries. Having such small molecules will make a huge impact in our screening against the variety of targets that NCATS works on and will also help tremendously in bioinformatics analysis which will allow a more thorough and effective SAR expansion by the medicinal chemist.<br /><br />Purpose and Objectives<br />NCATS is in need of 5,050 small molecules to be included in our screening libraries. Adding diversity to chemical libraries is imperative to our operation, as we screen a variety of targets against these in-house collections.<br /><br />Project Description<br />The Contractor shall provide the following:<br />1.

<CONTACT>Lauren Lauver 215-697-5023

<a href="mailto:lauren.lauver@navy.mil">lauren.lauver@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk intends to acquire fully integrated replacement shelters for the Relocatable Over-The-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) transmit site arrays, the transmit site monitor (TSM) and the receive site monitor (RSM).  The ROTHR System is a very unique radar system that uses high-frequency (HF) over-the-horizon (OTH) radar to track and detect drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins. ROTHR is based on an extremely complex technology that uses the Earths ionosphere to reflect/refract radar signals over extraordinary distances. The electronic shelters are an integral part of the operation of the ROTHR system. The shelters provide electrical, electro-magnetic, and environmental shielding of the electronics.
 Within the shelter there are physical limitations, i.e. ridged cables, air conditioner tuning, physical footprint, etc. that restricts changes  to the current configuration. The requirement is for fully integrated shelters meaning the contractor will be required to manufacture replacement shelters and install the ROTHR system to operational levels. Unique ROTHR installation and integration effort to enable form fit and function shelters requires integral involvement of the shelter manufacturing effort with technical knowledge and experience of the ROTHR RADAR electronic equipment which is necessary due to unique site specific parameters indicative of a one of a kind, limited production system like ROTHR.
 

The placement of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Priced (FFP), type contract that will allow the placement of delivery orders of various quantities is anticipated beginning on 27 September 2017. The applicable NAICS code is 332311 and the FSC is 5450.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Raytheon Company) under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Raytheon, as the sole developer, producer, design agent, and possessor of the Level III drawings of the ROTHR systems, is the only company with the highly specialized knowledge and technical data to provide the required shelter manufacturing and integrating services.
 The Small Business office has reviewed this market research and concurs with the acquisition strategy identified herein. Challengers may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by sending challenges to Lauren Lauver at lauren.lauver@navy.mil. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all challenges to this sole source determination by the specified response date will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice. Furthermore, this synopsis notice also serves as a follow-up to a previously posted sources sought notice under solicitation# N0018916RZ065. The fully approved Justification and Approval will be posted at the time of solicitation.

<SUBJECT>Influenza Free Ferret Supply
<SOLNBR>HHS-CDC-SS-2016-94709
<RESPDATE>032916
<CONTACT>Thaddeus E Rollins, Phone 770-488-1971, Fax 770-488-2778, Email tnr6@cdc.gov
<DESC>Title: Influenza-free Ferret Supply for Improving Public Health<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice for market survey to be used for preliminary planning purposes. This request is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.<br />Background. The Influenza Division at CDC requires access to healthy ferrets that are serologically negative against all influenza virus strains. These animals are needed for i) the production of strain-specific immune sera for use as a diagnostic reagent and to monitor antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses which is necessary to assist with influenza vaccine composition recommendations ii) the safety and efficacy testing of vaccine candidates against influenza viruses with the potential to cause a pandemic and iii) the evaluation of the virulence, transmissibility and antiviral resistance of emerging influenza viruses that pose a threat to public health. Pursuing these critical missions of the Influenza Division is dependent on a constant and reliable supply of influenza-free ferrets. <br />Project Objective - The purpose of this contract is to secure a stable supply of healthy ferrets that are sero-negative against influenza A and B viruses so that the Influenza Division at CDC can provide accurate and reliable assessments of influenza surveillance, safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates and risk assessments of emerging influenza viruses that pose a threat to public health. <br />Scope of Work - The contractor will provide the CDC with a monthly inventory of ferrets available for purchase. This inventory must include at least 50 healthy, male ferrets that are 3-6 months of age and are sero-negative against influenza A and B viruses. The contractor will provide up to 120 ferret pre-bleeds per month selected by the CDC based on the provided inventory list. Sera will be tested by the CDC to confirm sero-negativity. The contractor will deliver up to 120 ferrets per month in a single delivery each month based on the testing results and projected needs of the CDC. All ferrets will be transported in sealed, HEPA-filtered containers and in a climate controlled environment.<br />Technical Requirements: <br />Ferret Inventory Maintenance: <br />All CDC-bound ferrets at the contractor's facility will be maintained inside of a HEPA-filtered enclosure. All staff entering the enclosure will wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including respirator to protect the animals from potential exposure to influenza virus. Any staff experiencing influenza-like illness will not enter the ferret housing enclosure. An up to date inventory account of available ferrets will be provided to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at the CDC via email by the 5th day of each month and will include the dates of birth for each lot of animals. The ferret inventory will be maintained so that at least 50 healthy, male ferrets that are sero-negative to influenza A and B viruses will be available on any given month. The age of these ferrets will be restricted to 3-6 months at the time of inventory assessment. Each month the CDC will select up to 120 ferrets from the inventory to screen for potential purchase; the COR will communicate this selection to the contractor in an email.
<p>Delivery of Ferret Prebleeds:<br />The contractor will collect blood samples from each of the selected ferrets and will isolate approximately 0.2-0.5 mL of serum from each sample. This will be accomplished by centrifugation of whole blood and transfer of the separated top layer of serum to a fresh, sterile vial that is labeled with the corresponding ferret ear tag number. Within 3 business days of the CDC's request for prebleeds, the contractor will ship the frozen serum samples via overnight delivery to the CDC so that they arrive on a non-holiday, business day. The contractor will also email the COR a list of the prebleeds (itemized by ferret ID) with each ferret's date of birth included. The sera will be tested for the presence of influenza antibody by the CDC and, based on the results, the COR will communicate via email which ferrets should be delivered to the CDC.<br />Delivery of Ferrets: <br />Up to 12 deliveries per year (1 per month) will be scheduled between the contractor and the COR at the CDC. Each delivery will be scheduled within two weeks of the COR's communication of screening results to the contractor. All ferrets will be housed in sealed, HEPA-filtered animal transport containers and transportation will occur in a climate-controlled environment. Transport containers will be positioned so that ample airflow is maintained during transport. Ferrets are extremely sensitive to elevated temperatures. Anyone loading or unloading the ferrets should wear personal protective equipment including a respirator to protect the animals from potential exposure to influenza during transport to the CDC. If ferrets are transported via ground, a back-up vehicle will be available in case the primary transport vehicle malfunctions. <br />Replacement Ferrets:<br />Any ferrets that die in transit will be replaced by the contractor at no cost to the CDC. Any ferret identified as sero-positive after being tested upon arrival at the CDC will be replaced by the contractor at no cost to the CDC.<br />Anticipated period of performance. The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months base year with four (4) option years, twelve (12) months each. <br />Capability statement /information sought.

User Setup
The system shall provide capability to set up specific users with corresponding capabilities according to need or security.  At minimum provide the following setup types:
Super User
The Super User shall have all rights and access to all functions that are offered by the software application. Only one user per customer may have this role. However, the Super User will be able to Add Super User Substitutes who automatically have the same rights as the actual Super User.
Partner User
Super Users may Add Partners. The partner role enables Super Users to delegate entire branches (e.g. a building pool) of their tree view to a partner (e.g. to a regional manager within the same organization, or to an external facility management service provider). This gives the Partner User full access rights for the node assigned to him or her, including all of the lower-level nodes and meters it contains.
The Partner User has the same rights as the Super User on the delegated node, but can only display the part of the tree view assigned to him or her. The Partner User has an own user management facility, and is therefore able to Add new users (of type Basic User and Advanced User, see next page) and assign nodes to them (within the given part of the tree view). 
Such Partner Users are invisible to Super Users outside of the partner company. Like the Super User, Partner Users can Add Super User Substitutes but they do not have the authorization to add additional Partners.
Advanced User
Each node in the tree view (site, building, etc.) can be assigned to an Advanced User who has the following rights:
Reading rights - Example: generate and subscribe to reports, display meter lists 
Writing rights - Example: Add new buildings and meters, or enter metering data
Deleting rights - Example: delete values, meters or nodes for which the user is the contact person. Note: When a User deletes a meter, the meter and all entered values are automatically moved to the "deleted meters" node (the Super User's "recycle bin"). Therefore, the Super User has the possibility to finally delete meters, or to restore them.
Basic User
Alternatively, each node can be assigned to a Basic User who has the following rights:
Reading rights - Example: generate and subscribe to reports, display meter lists
Writing rights - Enter and edit meter readings only (no meter exchange)
Deleting rights - Delete individual meter readings only
Report Types
The software shall support the following report types:

Registration with Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System 
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials. The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing. To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS. CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS). FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.
Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 requires a CPARS evaluation. A government Focal Point will register your contract within thirty days after contract award and, at that time, you will receive an email message with a User ID (to be used when reviewing evaluations). Additional information regarding the evaluation process can be found at www.cpars.gov or if you have any questions, you may contact the Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. 
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete. For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually. Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment. The Contractor representative will have sixty (60) days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the CO.
Failure for the Contractor s representative to respond to the evaluation within those sixty (60)  days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond; the Contractor s representative will be  locked out  of the evaluation and may no longer send comments. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly">In January 2015, the NINDS made two 10-year IDIQ contract awards to Albany Molecular Research Inc. and MRIGlobal under the DMFP. These are the only two organizations currently under the DMFP contract program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NINDS has a need to increase the competition pool under this program through the current order period ending January 14, 2025. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly">In an effort to identify small business concerns that might be capable of competing and performing under the DMFP, we are issuing this notice and asking small business concerns who believe that they have the capacity and ability to meet the "Statement of Work" requirements as currently in place under the DMFP as set forth in Attachment No. 1 hereto, and to submit a complete and detailed capability response.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly">We are seeking capability responses from small business concerns to determine if re-solicitation of this requirement to increase our current IDIQ pool can be set aside exclusively for small business participation only.</p>

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. For information regarding this acquisition, contact the Contracting Officials listed herein.</p>
<p>This exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (see 3.104). Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.</p>
<p>********************************************************************<br />The U.S. Coast Guard Office (USCG) of Contract Operations, Formal Contracts Division III anticipates a need for the procurement of the following services and supplies described herein:</p>
<p>47' Motor Lifeboat (MLB) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The 47' MLB fleet is&nbsp;in&nbsp;need of a major renovation to extend the service life primarily due to system obsolescence and reliability issues. The USCG has initiated a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to execute these modifications. The anticipated modifications listed below are not intended to increase the operational capability of the boats, and will primarily consist of replacement of existing systems and equipment. Following the completion of all SLEP work items, the 47' MLBs must be restored to meet their original capabilities upon return to the Coast Guard. There are a total of 117 of the 47' MLB's currently in the Coast Guard fleet, of which the USCG anticipates up to107 could be inducted into the SLEP. The anticipated SLEP work items include include the following(Note: see draft SOW for anticipated level of effort for each work item):</p>
<p>&bull; Propulsion System <br />&bull; Electrical Power Generation System <br />&bull; Open and Enclosed Bridge Chairs<br />&bull; Steering System <br />&bull; Non-Skid <br />&bull; Repair Hull Structure as needed <br />&bull; Towline Reels <br />&bull; Fender System <br />&bull; Navigation System <br />&bull; Deck Recess Grating <br />&bull; Forward Deck <br />&bull; Hull Preservation System <br />&bull; Survivor's Compartment Decking <br />&bull; Remote Control Spotlight <br />&bull; Fire Suppression System<br />&bull; Auxiliary Machinery Space Ventilation Fan <br />&bull; Exterior Junction Boxes <br />&bull; Rudders <br />&bull; Reduction Gears <br />&bull; Window Wash Tank and Blowers <br />&bull; Refurbish Mast Assembly <br />&bull; Quick Acting Water Tight Hatches</p>
<p>The USCG anticipates awarding a contract to provide and install the equipment necessary to complete the SLEP along with the associated engineering and logistics support, including a technical data package. The largest modification will be the replacement of the propulsion system. It is anticipated that if a Request for Proposal (RFP) is initiated, the potential Offerors will be required to provide technical proposals that identify specific pieces of equipment that will meet the performance requirements, provide preliminary arrangement drawings that show how all new equipment will interface with the boat, provide a notional weight and moment report, provide a trim &amp; stability analysis showing that the proposed design will not affect the boats self-righting capability, and provide an electric power and load analysis. The Government will provide existing drawings and technical data as government furnished information (GFI).</p>
<p>The Coast Guard anticipates using one single contractor to conduct engineering design and production for 47' MLB SLEP. After award, the Contractor shall perform detailed engineering and design to incorporate the proposed equipment. Upon acceptance of the design, a first article production order will be executed to complete the SLEP work items on an existing 47' MLB for testing. Once construction and testing is completed and approved, a full rate production option will be executed. Delivery of the full technical data package is anticipated during this phase. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this acquisition will be unrestricted under NAICS 336611 with the small business size standard being less than 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: It is anticipated that a requirements contract will be awarded with one base year and seven option years.</p>
<p>Place of performance: At the prospective prime contractor's facility</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to gather industry feedback on the following:</p>
<p>1. Is there industrial capacity within the United States available to support the anticipated execution of the 47' MLB SLEP, ranging from at least ten (10) boats per year, up to thirty (30) boats per year for a total production spanning up to eight (8) years (base year with seven option years)?</p>
<p>2. What industry strategies are available to execute and exepedite this work?</p>
<p>3. Is Industry capable of: (Note: please address each area with more than a yes/no answer. Details gathered will assist with final acquisition strategy and help shape draft request for proposal):</p>
<p>A. Coordinating and/or providing the logistics involved with moving/shipping/transporting the 47' MLBs from their duty stations or a haul out location to the contractor facility and on to their next duty station after completion of the SLEP (including coast to coast changes)? (*Note: Due to their physical size, 47' MLBs are difficult to transport over land, which may necessitate a waterborne delivery to certain locations. There is a geographical restriction of 320 nm the USCG can move boats by water from their homeport.) Multiple facilities may be used to complete the work; however, the number of production facilities should be kept to a minimum to ensure government oversight, quality assurance, and configuration control. It is anticipated that the logistics/shipping/transferring of boats will be the responsibility of the contractor under this contract.</p>
<p>B. Maintaining Quality Control and maintaining a standard configuration over a fleet of up to 107 boats?<br /><br />C. First Article Testing? - In addition to acceptance testing for contract compliance performed on every boat, at least one self righting test will be required to ensure self-righting capability is maintained following the installation of SLEP work items, and an inclining experiment will need to be verified and validated.</p>
<p>D. Training - as boats complete SLEP and are returned to the field, how can various aspects of training (operation and maintenance) on the new systems be incorporated as efficiently as possible to allow the assets to be placed back into service?</p>
<p>E. Completing the production schedule of all 107 boats within eight (8) years. Is the timeline estimate regarding schedule for this program realistic? Please base this upon the proposed work items and logistics/transportation constraints. What is your estimated challenges if any, on the proposed timeline for boats going through SLEP process (i.e. long lead time material requirements, transfer custody to contractor, transportation to contractor facility, work item completion, testing, transportation back, transfer back to CG, and training, etc.)?</p>

Background

The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a national, voluntary research program aiming to study how genes affect health by building one of the world's largest medical databases by safely collecting blood samples and health information from one million Veterans.  MVP is overseen by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Research and Development and is coordinated by the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center and other program units within VA.  Veterans enrolled in the VA Healthcare System are eligible to participate in MVP.  Participation involves providing consent, completing surveys, providing a one-time blood sample for use in future research, allowing ongoing access to electronic health records, and agreeing to future contact.  Since 2011, MVP has enrolled over 500,000 Veterans into the program.  Current recruitment and enrollment modalities used are invitational mailings, phone calls, paper-based surveys, and in-person enrollment activities at ~50 participating VA medical facilities and their affiliated community-based sites.

A pioneer in the field of genomic research, MVP will use the data collected to facilitate research investigations on the associations between subject phenotype and genotype by combining large scale population genomic sequence information with the VA's unique data sets derived from its world class electronic health record (EHR).  The ultimate goal of MVP is to enable genomic discoveries that can translate to improvements in the healthcare of Veterans and the nation at large through the delivery of care based on individual genetic, clinical, lifestyle and military-exposure profiles.

Anticipated Scope of Work

The Contractor shall provide a SaaS application that complies with applicable VA regulations and security standards as outlined in the requirements identified throughout Section 5 of the draft PWS.  The SaaS application shall be hosted and accessible through a commercial cloud platform. The SaaS application and service(s) must be able to collect and manage large volumes of study data that will include Protected Health Information/Personally Identifiable Information, perform simple and complex data edit checking, provide robust reporting capabilities, and allow for easy data import and export.  The Contractor shall provide a SaaS application that satisfies the required capabilities, features, and functionalities identified in Appendix 1 of the draft PWS. Appendix may evolve and the capabilities, features, and functionalities may be updated and reprioritized over the life of the effort.

Further, the SaaS application must be configurable to meet the evolving participant recruitment, enrollment, and engagement needs of this growing, mega-cohort study.

Scope of Work

VA is seeking information regarding established/existing Contact Centers capable of providing Tier 1 support to Veterans with proven industry and/or federal experience in successfully managing the over 20 million calls per year anticipated by VA.  The Contractor s Contact Center solution must be established and operational within 50 days of award and is required to be an onshore (domestic) service provider delivering the customer experience, journeys and engagement life cycle to the Veterans through trained, empathetic call center agents.  Calls received will be logged into the Call Center s contact center system, and triaged/handed-off to established Tier 2 and Tier 3 VA Call Centers and facilities.  

Contact Center Solution Capabilities:
24x7x365 Support
Scalability to support 20 million calls (or more!) per year
Empathetic agents trained to accurately respond, log and triage

<CONTACT>Mosley, Carla
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.101 requiring dissemination of information for proposed contract actions.  This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract, and is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is prescribed by FAR 13.501(a).
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) intends to issue a five year (one 12-month base year; and four 12-month option years); firm fixed prices; sole source award contract to the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History (CUMNH).  However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement demonstrating the ability to provide the requested services, which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date.  Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided.  No requests for capability briefings will be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
Interested vendors must respond to this notice on or before February 15, 2017 at 3:00 pm Eastern Time by sending an email to Carla.Mosley@bia.gov.
NAICS Code: 712110 - Museums - primarily engaged in the preservation and exhibition of objects of historical, cultural, and/or educational value.
Background:
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Museum Program is mandated to ensure that BIA archaeological collections housed in non-Federal repositories are cared for according to Federal standards, as outlined in 36 CFR Part 79. BIA is also responsible for compliance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) on human remains, funerary objects, objects of cultural patrimony, and sacred objects in its collections.
The University of Colorado Museum of Natural History (CUMNH) houses more than 170 cubic feet of archaeological objects and an undetermined amount of associated documentation on behalf of BIA which were recovered from Indian reservations. Archaeological material originating from tribal lands and administered by the BIA was deposited at CUMNH as a result of archaeological field work and other projects conducted under the authority of Antiquities Act permits, between 1906 and 1979, prior to enactment of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA). CUMNH has been providing storage for these collections. The BIA collections at CUMNH include at least 115 sets of human remains and 145 associated funerary objects over which BIA asserts control under NAGPRA. No notices have been published and the collections are not in compliance with NAGPRA. 
The BIA collections at CUMNH need to be analyzed to determine their provenience, then inventoried, catalogued, photographed, and rehoused (as needed). The inventory information will include information required for NAGPRA inventories which BIA will report to National NAGPRA and to potentially affiliated tribes with an invitation to consult.
Scope:
The contractor will complete mandatory cataloguing and inventory of archaeological collections, as well as the work for compliance with NAGPRA by going through the BIA collections; inventorying and cataloging the collections; and rehousing as needed. 
Objectives:
The objectives of this contract are to identify, inventory, and catalog all the collections housed at CUMNH that fall under BIAs control, focusing on collections from Bennetts Peak, Newcomb, Kawaikuh, from Southern Ute lands (La Plata), and other BIA sites that may be discovered in the Museums collections. This is required in order for BIA to maintain accountability over its collections that are housed in non-BIA repositories. Further objectives for this contract, potentially in future phases, are to complete inventories of human remains and associated funerary objects under the control of BIA and in the possession of CUMNH in order to comply with NAGPRA requirements.

<CONTACT>Rachel A. Turk, Phone 3016199235, Email rachel.a.turk2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901 with Draeger, Inc. (Draeger), 3135 Quarry Road, Telford, PA 18969-1042, for the provision of software and hardware maintenance services, collectively referred to as sustainment services, for the Innovian ARMD system in support of Naval Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide. ARMD is inclusive of all hardware, firmware, and software, to include non-clinical Draeger software installed on MTF workstations. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, vehicles, materials, supervision, and transportation necessary to provide preventive, corrective, and emergency maintenance services. The estimated period of performance is 27 Jul 2017 through 26 July 2019.
<p>Draeger is the sole original designer and creator of the Innovian ARMD system, which is a FDA 510(k) cleared Class 1 medical device. Draeger holds all copyrights to the software and no other entity has the right to reengineer, modify, or provide technical support for, or enhancements to this system. Draeger licensed the software for use by the DoD in September 2008. Since then, it has invested heavily in the engineering efforts required to make the system (software, workstations, and servers) compliant with DoD cybersecurity requirements. Draeger has also provided continual sustainment services under the current sustainment contract since that time. Without Draeger's sustainment services, the Government will experience application performance problems with the Innovian ARMD system across multiple data systems and at all locations, ultimately limiting user access to critical patient care information and the loss of patient data. In addition, in order to operate the ARMD system, it must maintain its Authority to Operate (ATO). The ARMD system has a DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) Authority to Operate (ATO) on all Service networks. Maintaining an ATO for each DoD Service requires a partnership directly with the contractor to ensure the authority remains current. The current ATO must be renewed using the DoD's new Risk Management Framework (RMF) process. Additionally, any other source would require access to Draeger's proprietary data in order to successfully provide sustainment services for the Innovian software and hardware. This data is owned by Draeger and not available to the Government. Accordingly, Draeger is the only qualified source for this sustainment contract. A sources sought notice was issued on 12 January 2017 for this requirement and no additional sources responded.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 5 (8.5 x 11 inch) pages using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information, or submissions that only ask questions will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 12:00 PM Local Time, 07 February 2016. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: E-MAIL:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER- THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  The U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), Desert Southwest Regional Office (DSW), intends to award a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), to Euclid Vidaro Manufacturing Co., 333 Martinel Dr., Kent, OH, 44240-4370, UNITED STATES, for KV-Gard (Extremely High Voltage) bare hand suits and conductive boots.  The basis for this sole source award is outlined in the Single Source Justification information below:
<p>1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting office.  <br /> Western Area Power Administration, Desert Southwest Region, G1527, 615 South 43rd Ave, Phoenix, Arizona, 85009</p>
<p>2.  Description of supply or service required to meet the agency's needs. <br />This is a fixed-price, sole source acquisition to Euclid Vidaro Manufacturing Co., for KV-Gard EHV (Extremely High Voltage) bare hand suits and conductive boots, to replace the ones that have become worn, damaged, failed Ohms test prior to use and out of commission due to serviceable years(3-5).  Euclid's KV-Gard conductive clothing offers the most complete and effective protection available for workers in live-line maintenance. Renowned industry-wide for safety, comfort and durability, Euclid's KV-GARD conductive clothing is a soft Faraday cage that puts the linemen at the same potential as the conductor. With clothing bonded to the conductor, the linemen can work comfortably inside the electrical field with gloved hands at close range.</p>
<p>3.  The rationale or circumstances for limiting competition.  <br />Western uses KV-Gard bare hand suits for safety around high voltage. The bare hand suit is soft conductive clothing worn by Western's linemen while performing live line maintenance using the bare hand technique at voltages up to 500,000 volts. The bare hand suit creates a Faraday cage around the linemen that is the same potential as the energized conductor. This allows the linemen to work comfortably inside the electrical field with gloved hands at close range.</p>
<p>Euclid's KV-GARD bare hand suits have performed well for Westerns line crews. There have been no recorded injuries or malfunctions with this suit and it has become a trusted PPE element.</p>
<p>The KV-GARD suit has been integrated into Westerns bare hand training for over 20 years. All of Western's linemen are trained in its specific use and function. The KV-GARD conductive suite is also integrated into the specific written work procedures the Western uses to maintain the EHV transmission system. Additionally, the KV-GARD bare hand suit is referenced by Western's PSSM and PSOM. In these documents Westerns identifies how the suits will be worn and inspected.</p>
<p>Royer Conductive Boots has been the most respected boots in energized field industry. Royer Conductive boots has the following features:<br />&bull;	2.0 mm full grain leather<br />&bull;	Stitching threads tested for strength<br />&bull;	Padded ankle protector to ease climber wear<br />&bull;	Double dual-rib steel shank<br />&bull;	Protective steel plate<br />&bull;	Vulcanized rubber Chevron slip and oil resistant sole<br />&bull;	Protective steel toe<br />&bull;	Double conductive calf strap<br />&bull;	Conductive removable felt liner No. 1768C<br />&bull;	Conductivity between 0 and 10 000 Ohms<br />Other vendors who inventory conductive boots were built for chemicals controlled in laboratories such as Intel and Boeing.<br />All responsible sources may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement in response to this requirement, which shall be considered by the agency.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals.  No solicitation will be posted.  All interest/capability statements must be received by the Government no later than 11:00am local (AZ) time, Wednesday, 02/06/2017 to Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration.

<DESC>This is a notice prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.2 "Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions." US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District intends to negotiate/award a sole-source contract with Oregon State University (OSU).
<p>Description of this service is Data Collection, Processing, Archiving, Analysis, Reporting, and Synthesis of Beachface and Topographic Dune Data Collection and Morphology Change Analysis along the northern extent of South Beach State Park adjacent to Yaquina Bay, OR. This is follow-on work to an Intergovernmental Personnel Agreement (IPA) that was in place from 2014-2016 with OSU. The work under the IPA is not complete and this new follow-on effort is intended to result in the delivery of a design and plan for the entire evaluation.</p>
<p>As this requirement is estimated to be under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, the procedures in FAR subpart 13.5 are being employed. Justification for sole source action is that the USACE expects substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Furthermore OSU's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences are the leading experts in coastal morphology and nearshore processes that are specific to the project location.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 541360 - Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services, which has a small business size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to the point of contact for this notice before the notice end date. If no affirmative written responses are received by 04:00 PM local time on 13 February 2017, an award will be made without further notice. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Electronic responses and questions shall be submitted via email to Ryan.S.McClimon@usace.army.mil. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>

<p>NOTE: Vendor specific terms and conditions that may be contingently proposed for subsequent inclusion into the contract will not be considered by the Government in its evaluation of quotations. This aspect also includes the Government's exclusion from requests by vendors to enter into supplemental agreements from their respective company in order to conduct business under a resultant contract award. Vendors that are not able to comply with the aforementioned conditions will be determined as noncompliant with the solicitation requirements and therefore may be removed from consideration for award.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Quotes: In accordance with FAR 12.602(a) and FAR 13.106-2, the following is provided:</p>
<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>(a) The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the vendor whose quotation conforms to the solicitation and is considered most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:</p>
<p>1. Price Quotation<br />2. Technical Capability</p>
<p>(b) Basis of Award: The award will be made to the vendor whose quotation represents the best value to the government. As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the government based on selection of the lowest evaluated price that is deemed technically acceptable. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.</p>
<p>A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing.

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract - FDA1176369 <br />
<p><br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration intends to make a sole source award to Aptar Stelmi for Lyophlization Stoppers to be used with the Cozzoli Vial Filling and Stoppering Machine. The performance qualification and validation of the Cozzoli Vial Filling and Stoppering Machine was performed using 13mm Bromobutyl Rubber Ultraclean, double Tyvek/Plastic Lyophilization Stoppers and 20mm Bromobutyl Rubber, Ultraclean Aptar Lyophlization Stoppers. The continued use of the Aptar Lyophlization Stoppers are required as using a different stopper would mandate revalidation and fabrication of new parts which ultimately take over a year to manufacture and additional funding. A delay of the delivery of these specified stoppers will delay testing and release of influenza vaccines which will have a great public health impact.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .]<br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK <br />TITLE: Hydraulic Fluid for Standard (SRM) 2806 <br />LAB REQUESTING: Material Measurement Laboratory
<p>I. BACKGROUND INFORMATION <br />NIST has an immediate need to procure Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2806 (Hydraulic Fluid). SRM 2806 is composed of medium test dust suspended in filtered hydraulic fluid. The need is to conduct research in generation and size-calibration of particles; develops and applies methods for the sampling, concentration, separation, and chemical analysis of trace atmospheric gases and particles; and research fundamental aspects of trace detection of explosive and narcotic particles using ion mobility spectrometry. <br />II. SCOPE OF WORK<br />The Contractor shall prepare samples according to Annex F of ISO 1171 with the following specifications:</p>
<p>Standard Reference Material 2806 is composed of medium test dust suspended in filtered hydraulic fluid. A minimum of 400 bottles of this material shall be produced under the specifications outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Production method<br />The contractor shall prepare samples according to Annex F of ISO 11171 with the following specifications:<br />1.1 Produce a minimum of 400 bottles (clause F.2),<br />1.2 Total volume of suspension to be at least 200 L (clause F.2),<br />1.3 Before addition of dust, oil in the sump cleaned to a degree such that the oil contains fewer than the maximum allowable contaminant levels shown in Table I for particle sizes larger than 4, 6, 14, 21, and 30 &micro;m(c), respectively (clause F.2).<br />1.4 Dust concentration must fall between 10 000 particles/mL to 17 000 particles/mL larger than 4 &#61549;m(c) and between 20 particles/mL to 300 particles /mL larger than 30 &#61549;m(c). Particle sizes to be analyzed by the contractor include, but are not limited to, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 20, 25 and 30 &micro;m(c) (clause F.5),<br />1.5 On-line particle sensor shall be installed by the contractor on the primary recirculation line used to fabricate the material<br />1.6 Batch and process to be validated by the contractor according to acceptance criteria described below, instead of clause F.5.<br />1.7 Particulate material is RM 8631 - will be supplied by NIST to the manufacturer.<br />Table I. Maximum allowable contaminant levels for clean fluid and bottles</p>
<p>Particle size (&micro;m(c)) Particles/mL larger than indicated size<br />4 40<br />6 20<br />14 1.3<br />21 0.32<br />30 0.05</p>
<p>2 Single batch of material<br />2.1 A minimum of 400 bottles shall be produced by the contractor from the same sump of hydraulic fluid medium test dust suspension. From these 400 bottles, 40 bottles will be used by the contractor to demonstrate bottle-to-bottle homogeneity at a level of acceptance that will be provided by NIST, 24 bottles to be sent to NIST and used by NIST for determining acceptability, and 10 bottles to be held in reserve by the contractor for reference purposes. <br />3 Bottle<br />3.1 Each bottle shall contain 400 mL of hydraulic fluid medium test dust suspension. Bottle caps are to be made of a hard phenolic material and bottle cap liner or inner seal should be made of Teflon. The seal shall be attached to the cap and washed with filtered ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. The seal and cap must be completely dry, void of all liquid before it is placed on the bottle.<br />4 Bottle requirements<br />4.1 The contractor shall use Bottles pre-cleaned of particles to a level cleaner than the maximum allowable contaminant levels shown in Table 1 for particles larger than 4, 6, 14, 21, and 30 &#61549;m(c), respectively (clause F.2). The sample bottles shall be cleaned by the contractor and verified in accordance with ISO 3722 according to the sampling scheme defined by NIST. Each bottle will be labeled by the contractor according to the scheme X-Y-Z, where X refers to the batch number assigned by NIST, Y refers to the order in which the bottle was filled (e.g., Y=1 for the first bottle, Y=2 for the second, etc.), and Z refers to a letter designating the sampling port used to fill the bottle. The labels are to be applied to the corresponding bottle cap by the contractor and must not include any company references, logos, or names. No label is to be applied or attached directly to the bottle, itself.<br />5 Particulate material<br />5.1 NIST RM 8631 - will be provided by NIST within 30 calendar days after contract award<br />6 Hydraulic Fluid <br />6.1 The contractor shall use Exxon Mobil MIL-PRF-5606 hydraulic fluid to make the new SRM 2806 material<br />7 Particle Concentration<br />7.1 Particle concentration must fall between 10 000 particles/mL to 17 000 particles/mL larger than 4 &#61549;m(c) and between 20 particles/mL to 300 particles/mL larger than 30 &#61549;m(c).<br />8 Additive to the oil<br />8.1 Stadis 450 antistatic additive should be added by the contractor to adjust the conductivity of the oil to 2500 &plusmn;250 pS/m.<br />9 Acceptance Criteria<br />9.1 The manufacturer shall analyze one, randomly chosen bottle out of each ten bottles produced for within batch homogeneity as described in ISO 11171 clauses F.3 through F.5, except that only a total of forty (40) bottle samples will be analyzed by the contractor. For example, one randomly chosen bottle will be chosen by the contractor from the first 10 collected (bottles 1-10), one from the second group of 10 bottles (bottles 11-20), one from the third group of 10 bottles ((bottles 21-30), etc. This is a reduction from the requirements of ISO 11171 (every fifth sample) because an additional requirement is specified to conduct continuous on-line automatic particle counts to verify the uniformity of the suspension being prepared.<br />9.2 The results must meet the acceptance criteria specified in clause F.5 and using the allowable Coefficient of Variation CoV specified in the right-hand ("n=40") column of Table 8. The particle count results shall be documented by the contractor in the format shown in ISO 11171 Table 6 and provided to NIST for verification. If the results for all sizes do not meet these acceptance criteria or if they show evidence of a systematic bias, the batch will be rejected by NIST. <br />9.3 Lack of systematic bias in the manufacturing cycle will be verified first by the manufacturer (contractor) using a set of NIST generated statistical tests. NIST will provide a software package to be used by the contractor that will contain the following tests: Mean, standard deviation, slope of the sample time sequence, auto correlation and an ANOVA test. These tests will help the manufacturer assure that there is no bias in their process. Data used in these tests and the results will be sent to NIST. Acceptance boundaries are built into the software. Once these boundaries are met, the next step will require shipment of select bottles by the contractor to NIST for NIST analysis described in 9.4. <br />9.4 NIST will receive 24 NIST selected bottles from contractor (2.1) and subsequently test 8 bottles for within batch homogeneity using a light blockage automatic particle counter calibrated according to ISO 11171 using SRM 2806. The 8 bottles will consist of two bottles taken from each quartile of the production labeled assignment. The data will be compared by NIST to an analogous subset of 8 bottles taken from the 40 previously analyzed by the manufacturer. The 8 bottles from the manufacturer will be selected by the NIST from among those samples previously analyzed to qualify the batch according to acceptance criteria given in ISO 11171 clauses F.3 through F.5 and will consist of those samples sequentially nearest to the bottles selected for NIST analysis. For example, if there are 400 bottles, the sample bottles to be analyzed by NIST would be the following: 98, 99; then 198, 199; then 298, 299 and finally 398, 399. The data from these bottles would be compared to the data from bottles 90, 100; 190, 200; 290, 300; and 390 and 400 analyzed by the manufacturer. Both NIST and the manufacturer's results must show CoV's less than or equal to the values found in Table II and there must be no evidence of systematic bias. In counting each bottle, at least 3 counts per bottle must be obtained by both contractor and NIST and at least 240 mL from each bottle must be counted by contractor and NIST. The particle count results by both NIST and the manufacturer shall be documented by NIST. If data from NIST and supplier for the specified 16 samples (8 analyzed by NIST and 8 analyzed by the manufacturer) do not agree at all specified sizes, the batch will be rejected. <br />Table II. Values of CoV not to exceed for particle diameter determined by SRM 2806</p>
<p>Particle Size (&micro;m(c)) CoV (fraction)*<br />4 .008<br />6 .011<br />10 .016<br />12 .020<br />14 .023<br />20 .024<br />25 .045<br />30 .058<br />*Note: These are for cumulative counts for 8 bottles and 3 counts each (n=24). These values for CoV have been confirmed to be achievable using existing sample production techniques.<br />9.5 The manufacturer shall analyze the on-line particle count data collected by calculating the mean, standard deviation and CoV for each particle size. The resulting CoV for each particle size must be less than the acceptable limits shown in Table II. <br />9.6 All samples tested will exhibit a stable size distribution for a time period of 3 months at normal storage temperatures and conditions (ca 22&deg;C), and after 3 months of accelerated aging during which samples are stored at a temperature of 75&deg;C and 12&deg;C (all tests will run simultaneously). Size distributions are to be verified by NIST using automatic particle counting and scanning electron microscopy.<br />9.7 The mean of the cumulative concentration found from the 8 bottles for the designated particle diameters for both NIST and the manufacturer must be greater than the lower acceptable concentration found in Table III.</p>

These will be used by NIST to assess contamination in the test fluid. All of the sampling ports used to produce the 326+ bottles shall be used to produce these 12 bottles by the contractor, i.e., if 4 sampling ports were used, then 3 of these clean oil samples shall be taken by the contractor from each of the 4 ports. <br />10.3 Six (6) clean bottles with closures, cleaned in the same manner as those used to collect the samples <br />10.4 Relevant physical/chemical specifications for the batch material, including Material Safety Data Sheet, the electrical conductivity, viscosity, density, additive concentration, oil and additive specifics (source, manufacturer, grade, batch number, etc., possibly oil analysis results such as spectroscopy and/or chromatography), and concentrations of the following elements: Ag, Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, Vd, and Zn. Additional physical and chemical data on the material to be provided as requested.<br />10.5 All particle count results, including on-line particle counting results <br />11 Delivery Milestones<br />Required contract completion date is 180 calendar days after award. Shown below are desirable and approximate guidelines for performance. All days are calendar days. The process can proceed faster or slower depending upon the manufacturing process control and the results of test conducted on the material.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 8 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise. The program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and contract research organization (CRO) support through Phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team (LDT) composed of the principal investigator (PI), industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by CROs. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the PI; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.</p>
<p>The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research, a consortium of 8 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise. The program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and contract research organization (CRO) support through Phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team (LDT) composed of the principal investigator (PI), industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by CROs. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the PI; other research services can be provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.</p>

</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, engineers, and construction professionals to design and construct federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, functionality, constructability, durability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design and Construction services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, regulation or Executive Order, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, security requirements, and achieve at least a LEED Gold certification and SITES Silver.</p>
<p><br />The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to award a Bridging Design-Build (BDB) Contract for construction of a new U.S. Courthouse, located in the Nashville, Tennessee pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures (FAR Subpart 36.3).  The project includes design-build services, demolition, construction and site development of 3.4 acres for the new Courthouse.  The U.S. Courthouse of approximately 339,000 gross square feet includes underground structured parking.  The tenant agencies for the project include: U.S. District Court; Probation; U.S. Marshals Service; Office of the U.S. Attorney, GSA/PBS Field Office; U.S. Senate and Randolph Sheppard Vending Machine Operator.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price for the design build services.</p>
<p>This project will utilize the Design-Build (DB) delivery method, with the DB contract procured by competitive negotiation using a two phase design-build selection procedure (FAR Subpart 36.3). A single DB contract will be issued for a revised design concept submission (if necessary), Design Development Phase and Construction Documents Phase services, as well as all construction work including tenant improvements and all required specialty construction work. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively.</p>
<p>The purpose of Phase 1 (the Request for Qualifications) is to select the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase 1 to participate in Phase 2 (the Request for Proposals).  Once Phase 1 is complete, the Contracting Officer will invite the "short-listed" Offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals.  Potential Offerors are hereby placed on notice that GSA will publicly announce the names of the Phase 1 "short-list" on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of "Short-Listed" Offerors: The Contracting Officer will select a maximum of three (3) of the most highly rated Offerors to proceed to Phase 2.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the solicitation is prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include the Phase 2 evaluation factors, developed in accordance with 15.304.  Phase 2 solicitations require submission of technical and price proposals, which are evaluated separately, in accordance with Part 15.</p>
<p>No stipend is allocated for this project and will not be considered.<br />At the conclusion of Phase 2, GSA intends to award a contract to a single Offeror for all design and all construction services.</p>
<p>This procurement is a full and open procurement which will be open to both large and small business firms.  The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal.</p>
<p>As a combined synopsis, the solicitation is released along with this announcement.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>
budsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a USCG procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985). If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. The Sr. Transition Specialist is supervised by an OTI Division Chief (Program Learning, and Innovation Division or Field Programs Division) or his/her designee.</p>
<p>The incumbent for this position will be expected to initially work with the Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI), which develops, oversees, and manages critical processes supporting the implementation of OTI country programs.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the PLI Division engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.  The Sr. Transition Specialist will provide regular guidance and leadership for the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of ABC staff focusing on learning, training, innovation, monitoring and evaluation, and development of technology tools in support of OTI country programs.  The PLI/ABC team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation.<br />In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>&nbsp;In the absence of qualified sources, a contract will be awarded under the other than Full and Open Competition procedures, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b) (1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a request for competitive proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any response to this notice must provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;All qualified sources must respond in writing not later than 2:00PM CST, 17 February, 2017 and submitted via email with confirmation of receipt to: kurt.a.ennis.mil@mail.mil and mitchell.w.spaulding.mil@mail.mil</p>
<p>&nbsp;Contractors must have a current registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) with Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://www.sam.gov</p>
<p>&nbsp;Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition Brand Name - Securadyne Systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Contracting Activity: The contracting agency responsible for this action is the Will Rogers Air National Guard Base Contracting Office, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Description of Action: Expand the current ACS system to include phase 2 of the controlled area in Bldg. 1050 to include the addition of 3 doors with Bridgeport dual authentication hardware and electronic door strikers to the current access control system with any&nbsp;extra cabling needed to connect to the current ACS control box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Provide hardware and card readers to add ACS to 4 building access doors.</p>
<p>Provide a single card reader to be used for adding badging identification cards into the system.</p>
<p>Add a badging system to provide the unit with the ability to photograph, generate and print individual access control badges. Would need an identification card printer, cards, and USB camera.</p>
<p>Installation of all items will be needed as well. Building 1040, Room E153: Replace old Brevo card reader with new Bridgeport dual authentication reader.</p>
<p>Room E158: Add new Bridgeport dual authentication reader to door and connect to current Lenel box with Room E153. (<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">striker already in place</em>)</p>
<p><span style="BACKGROUND: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span>3. Description of Supplies/Services: Procure and install&nbsp;Securadyne Systems&nbsp;ACS components and upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Authority Cited: 10U.S.C 2304(c) (1), FAR 6.302-1, Securadyne Systems, is the "Original Equipment Distributor" for this purchase. Therefore they are the sole source facility to provide this type of equipment, giving the Federal Government unmatched quality and pricing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Reason for Authority Cited: Securadyne Systems ACS equipment is used by the 137th Intelligence Squadrons for securing facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:&nbsp;Securadyne Systems&nbsp;is the only authorized repair source for maintenance and repair of&nbsp;Securadyne Systems&nbsp;ACS Equipment effort was made to identify other contractors by posting on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) using J&amp;A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. Actions to Increase Competition: No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken as&nbsp;Securadyne Systems&nbsp;is the only company that provides these services without voiding the manufacture warranty and increasing cost substantially to the government of standalone non-compatible systems</p>
<p>&nbsp;8. Market Research: The 137th&nbsp;Air Refueling Wing&nbsp;has tried to find other sources for this type equipment; but no other providers were found that offered this specialty product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9. INTERESTED SOURCES -&nbsp;Securadyne Systems&nbsp;is an approved GSA vendor and provides the Air National Guard with a piece of equipment that meets the needs of the 137th Intelligence Squadrons. This equipment meets the installations needs and would provide the lowest cost to the end user.<br /><br />Statement of Work:<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<CONTACT>Zenab A. Chowdhry, Phone 3018276909, Email zenab.chowdhry@nih.gov
<DESC><p><br />The purpose of this amendment is to</p>
<p>1) Provide answers to questions submitted; and</p>
<p>2) Extend the proposal submission deadline to 5:00 PM EST, February 3, 2017.</p>
<p><br />ANSWERS TO REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION</p>
<p>1. Is this a new requirement?<br />Yes</p>
<p><br />2. Would you consider extending the proposal submission deadline, given the lost work day associated with the January 20th inaugural events?<br />The deadline is being extended to 5:00 PM EST February 3, 2017.</p>
<p><br />3. Have site assessment visits (to determine readiness for clinical trials operations) already taken place at the sites chosen to do the studies?<br />An initial evaluation of study sites was conducted during the initial grant review. The SIV will include a review of the site's readiness to initiate recruitment including the review of the required study specific operations.</p>
<p><br />4. Is there a page limitation for the technical proposal, not including the appendices?<br />The technical proposal should not exceed 20 pages.</p>
<p><br />5. Have the study protocols been fully developed for each of the research hubs?<br />The protocol development phase is staggered across the hubs with some hubs having completed the protocol development phase while other hubs will initiate this phase in the next several months.</p>
<p><br />6. Will the participating sites be required to use the same templates to report the results of study site monitoring?<br />Monitoring visit templates are developed by the contractor and the visit reports are completed by the contractor following each site visit. The response to any action items raised in the monitoring report is provided to the contractor and the NIMH by the study team. We recommend the use of a common template both for the monitoring report as well as the response to the report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />7. Appendix C notes that during the Base Period, there is "initial team training." Please clarify if there is to be a separate visit for training, or if training is to be done during site assessment before the site initiation visit. <br />The initial team training refers to the training of the monitoring staff. Study monitors will need to be trained in the regulations related to federally funded studies as well as the specific characteristics of mental health research studies including the monitoring behaviorally based intervention and adverse events.</p>
<p><br />8. The number of visits to be conducted per site is noted differently in sections of the RFP. Several sections of the RFP outline the average number of site visits per contract year and over the total contracting period (base plus all options). Please verify our assumptions as outlined below:<br />a. Confirm that each individual site will require an initiation, interim and closeout visits, and may, in addition, require an ad hoc/specialty visit. <br />Correct</p>
<p><br />b. Confirm that overall the average number of visits should be 10 - 15 per year (average 12), as sites may initiate at different time points during contract performance.<br />Correct</p>

<p>The Government is making available the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM). The NATO NRMM is a computer-based simulation tool that can predict a vehicle's steady-state operating capability over specified terrain. The NRMM was developed and proven by the Waterways Experiment Station (WES) and the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) over several decades. The NRMM has been revised and updated throughout the years; the current version used to perform this analysis is version 2, also known as NRMM II.</p>
<p>The NRMM II software is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers - Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). NRMM is only releasable to Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel for approved purposes. Requestors must submit a distribution agreement to obtain access. The agreement covers various aspects of NRMM use and redistribution, which also provide insights on network security requirements for those who use it. It's not classified, but it is subject to the ITAR and classified under U.S. Munitions List (USML) Category IX. To obtain a copy of the NRMM II Software, please follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>1) Complete and sign the Requesting Organization information blocks on the top of page 4 of the NRMM Distribution Agreement and forward via email to usarmy.detroit.acc.mbx.fmtv-a2@mail.mil</p>
<p>2) If approved, the POC identified in the Distribution Agreement will receive an email from the US Army Corps of Engineers with instructions on how the software will be provided.</p>
<p>3) Questions regarding the process to obtain the NRMM II Software can be directed to the FMTV A2 mailbox at usarmy.detroit.acc.mbx.fmtv-a2@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a total small business set aside competitive solicitation in the February 2017 timeframe for the detail design and construction of LCU 1700 craft under NAICS code 336611, using the employment standard of 1250 employees.</p>
<p>LCU 1700 is a program which replaces/ recapitalizes the capabilities provided by the Navy's Landing Craft, Utility (LCU) 1610 Class. The LCU 1610 Class provides the Navy's amphibious ships with an organic capability to move equipment between ship and shore in a reliable, fuel efficient manner. The LCU 1610 Class is highly reliable, has a range of 1200 nautical miles, has the ability to operate independently for up to 10 days and performs specialized missions in lower threat environments.</p>
<p>The solicitation will provide for the delivery of a LCU 1700 detail design (including data license rights) approximately twelve (12) months after contract award with options for the construction of up to 32 craft with the latest delivery date, if all options are exercised, in 2026. This solicitation also includes options for technical manuals, up to 10,000 hours of special studies services, and a technical data package. This solicitation includes the potential to issue orders for interim support products and services, engineering and industrial services, crew familiarization training, and shipping orders up to ten (10) years after contract award.</p>
<p>The Government seeks interested parties to create the detail design and construction which have experience in the detail design and construction of similarly complex craft. They should have facilities that can support construction of up to six craft per year of 140 feet in length and are capable of meeting the technical design requirements of an LCU 1700.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Building Museum in Washington DC has functional issues with the dedicated chiller for the galleries. This misapplication has caused compressor failure to one of the two compressors on the chiller. Replacing the defective compressor is very expensive and will not resolve the incorrect application issue.

<p>********************************************************************<br />The U.S. Coast Guard Office (USCG) of Contract Operations, Formal Contracts Division III anticipates a need for the procurement of the following services and supplies described herein:</p>
<p>47' Motor Lifeboat (MLB) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). The 47' MLB fleet is&nbsp;in&nbsp;need of a major renovation to extend the service life primarily due to system obsolescence and reliability issues. The USCG has initiated a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to execute these modifications. The anticipated modifications listed below are not intended to increase the operational capability of the boats, and will primarily consist of replacement of existing systems and equipment. Following the completion of all SLEP work items, the 47' MLBs must be restored to meet their original capabilities upon return to the Coast Guard. There are a total of 117 of the 47' MLB's currently in the Coast Guard fleet, of which the USCG anticipates up to107 could be inducted into the SLEP. The anticipated SLEP work items include include the following(Note: see draft SOW for anticipated level of effort for each work item):</p>
<p>&bull; Propulsion System <br />&bull; Electrical Power Generation System <br />&bull; Open and Enclosed Bridge Chairs<br />&bull; Steering System <br />&bull; Non-Skid <br />&bull; Repair Hull Structure as needed <br />&bull; Towline Reels <br />&bull; Fender System <br />&bull; Navigation System <br />&bull; Deck Recess Grating <br />&bull; Forward Deck <br />&bull; Hull Preservation System <br />&bull; Survivor's Compartment Decking <br />&bull; Remote Control Spotlight <br />&bull; Fire Suppression System<br />&bull; Auxiliary Machinery Space Ventilation Fan <br />&bull; Exterior Junction Boxes <br />&bull; Rudders <br />&bull; Reduction Gears <br />&bull; Window Wash Tank and Blowers <br />&bull; Refurbish Mast Assembly <br />&bull; Quick Acting Water Tight Hatches</p>
<p>The USCG anticipates awarding a contract to provide and install the equipment necessary to complete the SLEP along with the associated engineering and logistics support, including a technical data package. The largest modification will be the replacement of the propulsion system. It is anticipated that if a Request for Proposal (RFP) is initiated, the potential Offerors will be required to provide technical proposals that identify specific pieces of equipment that will meet the performance requirements, provide preliminary arrangement drawings that show how all new equipment will interface with the boat, provide a notional weight and moment report, provide a trim &amp; stability analysis showing that the proposed design will not affect the boats self-righting capability, and provide an electric power and load analysis. The Government will provide existing drawings and technical data as government furnished information (GFI).</p>
<p>The Coast Guard anticipates using one single contractor to conduct engineering design and production for 47' MLB SLEP. After award, the Contractor shall perform detailed engineering and design to incorporate the proposed equipment. Upon acceptance of the design, a first article production order will be executed to complete the SLEP work items on an existing 47' MLB for testing. Once construction and testing is completed and approved, a full rate production option will be executed. Delivery of the full technical data package is anticipated during this phase. <br /><br />It is anticipated that this acquisition will be unrestricted under NAICS 336611 with the small business size standard being less than 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: It is anticipated that a requirements contract will be awarded with one base year and seven option years.</p>
<p>Place of performance: At the prospective prime contractor's facility</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to gather industry feedback on the following:</p>
<p>1. Is there industrial capacity within the United States available to support the anticipated execution of the 47' MLB SLEP, ranging from at least ten (10) boats per year, up to thirty (30) boats per year for a total production spanning up to eight (8) years (base year with seven option years)?</p>
<p>2. What industry strategies are available to execute and exepedite this work?</p>
<p>3. Is Industry capable of: (Note: please address each area with more than a yes/no answer. Details gathered will assist with final acquisition strategy and help shape draft request for proposal):</p>
<p>A. Coordinating and/or providing the logistics involved with moving/shipping/transporting the 47' MLBs from their duty stations or a haul out location to the contractor facility and on to their next duty station after completion of the SLEP (including coast to coast changes)? (*Note: Due to their physical size, 47' MLBs are difficult to transport over land, which may necessitate a waterborne delivery to certain locations. There is a geographical restriction of 320 nm the USCG can move boats by water from their homeport.) Multiple facilities may be used to complete the work; however, the number of production facilities should be kept to a minimum to ensure government oversight, quality assurance, and configuration control. It is anticipated that the logistics/shipping/transferring of boats will be the responsibility of the contractor under this contract.</p>
<p>B. Maintaining Quality Control and maintaining a standard configuration over a fleet of up to 107 boats?<br /><br />C. First Article Testing? - In addition to acceptance testing for contract compliance performed on every boat, at least one self righting test will be required to ensure self-righting capability is maintained following the installation of SLEP work items, and an inclining experiment will need to be verified and validated.</p>
<p>D. Training - as boats complete SLEP and are returned to the field, how can various aspects of training (operation and maintenance) on the new systems be incorporated as efficiently as possible to allow the assets to be placed back into service?</p>
<p>E. Completing the production schedule of all 107 boats within eight (8) years. Is the timeline estimate regarding schedule for this program realistic? Please base this upon the proposed work items and logistics/transportation constraints. What is your estimated challenges if any, on the proposed timeline for boats going through SLEP process (i.e. long lead time material requirements, transfer custody to contractor, transportation to contractor facility, work item completion, testing, transportation back, transfer back to CG, and training, etc.)?</p>
<p>Offerors having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the services and supplies described herein are invited to submit complete information discussing the same to Scott.A.Wood@uscg.mil and Christine.Quintana@uscg.mil within 45 calendar days from the day this notice is posted. ALL inquiries and responses shall be submitted via email (less than 10 mb).</p>
<p>*NOTE: It is anticipated there will be dialogue with questions asked by industry. There will be an initial two week period deadline for questions. Those questions and answers will be collected and posted as an amendment to this announcement approximately two weeks later.<br /><br />Sources intending to respond to this RFI should thoroughly review the attached draft Statement of Work (comments regarding unclear or ambiguous requirements, as well as a critique of the draft SOW are also encouraged), Drawings and other applicable attachments and submit the following information:</p>

Million Veteran Program (MVP) Web Contract
Request for Information
January 30, 2017

Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain market information on capable sources of supply, industry practices, and input specific to the information provided.  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in furnishing this information.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party s expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to determine vendor capability to provide a Software as a Service (SaaS) application for the MVP that complies with applicable VA regulations and security standards as outlined in the requirements identified throughout Section 5 of the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) [Attachment 1].

The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete.  VA is under no obligation to provide feedback to the company, or to contact the company for clarification of any information submitted in response to this request.  However, VA may contact certain respondents to seek further information as market research.

Instructions for Submitting Questions and the RFI Response:

The VA Technology Acquisition Center points of contact for this RFI are Contract Specialist, Brandon Caltabilota and Contracting Officer, Mark Junda.  Submit any questions to this RFI directly to Brandon Caltabilota at Brandon.Caltabilota@va.gov and Mark Junda at Mark.Junda@va.gov.  

RFI responses are to be submitted via email directly to Brandon Caltabilota and Mark Junda by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, February 8, 2017.  Please limit responses to 15 pages or less.  

This document contains pertinent information for vendors to provide answers to the questions within.  Refer to section 5 of this RFI document for a list of business/technical related questions proposed by the Government.

All proprietary/company confidential material shall be clearly marked on every page that contains such.

Background

The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is a national, voluntary research program aiming to study how genes affect health by building one of the world's largest medical databases by safely collecting blood samples and health information from one million Veterans.  MVP is overseen by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Research and Development and is coordinated by the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center and other program units within VA.  Veterans enrolled in the VA Healthcare System are eligible to participate in MVP.  Participation involves providing consent, completing surveys, providing a one-time blood sample for use in future research, allowing ongoing access to electronic health records, and agreeing to future contact.  Since 2011, MVP has enrolled over 500,000 Veterans into the program.  Current recruitment and enrollment modalities used are invitational mailings, phone calls, paper-based surveys, and in-person enrollment activities at ~50 participating VA medical facilities and their affiliated community-based sites.

A pioneer in the field of genomic research, MVP will use the data collected to facilitate research investigations on the associations between subject phenotype and genotype by combining large scale population genomic sequence information with the VA's unique data sets derived from its world class electronic health record (EHR).  The ultimate goal of MVP is to enable genomic discoveries that can translate to improvements in the healthcare of Veterans and the nation at large through the delivery of care based on individual genetic, clinical, lifestyle and military-exposure profiles.

Anticipated Scope of Work

The Contractor shall provide a SaaS application that complies with applicable VA regulations and security standards as outlined in the requirements identified throughout Section 5 of the draft PWS.  The SaaS application shall be hosted and accessible through a commercial cloud platform. The SaaS application and service(s) must be able to collect and manage large volumes of study data that will include Protected Health Information/Personally Identifiable Information, perform simple and complex data edit checking, provide robust reporting capabilities, and allow for easy data import and export.  The Contractor shall provide a SaaS application that satisfies the required capabilities, features, and functionalities identified in Appendix 1 of the draft PWS. Appendix may evolve and the capabilities, features, and functionalities may be updated and reprioritized over the life of the effort.

Further, the SaaS application must be configurable to meet the evolving participant recruitment, enrollment, and engagement needs of this growing, mega-cohort study.

<DESC>Serum samples collected from feral swine will be tested for exposure to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) using a whole virus ELISA developed at Iowa State University. Serum samples are diluted 1:50 and plates are loaded with 100 &mu;l of the diluted sample per well. Plates are incubated at 25 &deg;C (serum) for 1 h and then washed 5 times with PBS (1X pH 7.4). Positive and negative plate controls, i.e., antibody-positive and -negative experimental serum samples, are run in duplicate on each ELISA plate. The antibody response in serum and oral fluid samples is represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios typical of ELISAs. A U.S. prototype PEDV isolate is used in the PEDV WV antibody ELISA. Each batch of approximately 1000 mL of PEDV is propagated on Vero cells. Results will be a positive or negative finding for each serum sample.
