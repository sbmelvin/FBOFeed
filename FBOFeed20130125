<SUBJECT>Acquisition of dynabeads tosylactivated-caoted for analysis of anthrax lethal factor in clinical samples

<RESPDATE>020913
<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Life Technologies Corporation, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, New York, 14072 for the acquisition of Dynabeads Tosylactivated-coated for analysis of anthrax lethal factor in clinical samples.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />Life Technologies is the only manufacturer of Dynabeads. Dynabeads have a uniform spherical shape with highly defined and consistent product characteristics. This yields levels of reproducibility which are unmatched by other beads. This allows for highly reproducible results, yielding data which meets the division's tight standards for reproducibility. The beads are indeed very uniform with a coefficient of variation of less than 3%. In addition to yielding reproducible results, this also allows for a reduction in non-specific binding. Because these beads are used to isolate anthrax lethal factor from highly complex matrices (like stool), the reduction in non-specific binding allows for a lower limit of detection of lethal factor. Additionally, the batch-to-batch reproducibility is less than 5%, meaning that each batch produced over the years is highly similar to previous batches. These are magnetic coated beads which are used for isolation of anthrax lethal factor from clinical samples. All data obtained to date over the past 7 years has been obtained with these beads and to change the type of beads would invalidate experiments and data and we must have continuity of experiments and experimental data.</p>
<p>Dynabeads tosylactivated-coated is the only material which will allow CDC to continue running our method under CLIA conditions. Purchase of beads from another company would cause CDC to revalidate our CLIA method and would not allow us to report a diagnosis of anthrax for many months.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Life Technologies Corporation. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 55591 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN February 9, 2013. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>( ) This acquisition is for supplies for which the government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore the Government intents to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approved sources are: ACTUANT CORPORATION<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(15515)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>****PLEASE CONTACT GLENDA MORGAN, IN WRITING, AT glenda.m.morgan@nasa.gov or fax 256-961-7723 FOR QUOTE OR TECHNICAL CONCERNS. NASA.MSFC has a requirement to propose to develop a prototype antenna system that operates at two frequencies required by the MSFC Software Defined Radio (SDR) system. The antenna will be a single structure, operating at S-band (2-2.4GHz and X-band (8-8.4GHz), with right hand circular polarization (RHCP). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from University Space Research Associations (USRA), on a sole source basis. USRA has previous exprience with the research of the patch antenna being used by the Programmable Ultra Lightweight Software Adaptive Radio (PULSAR) transponder.  The research deals with Intellectual Property (IP) as well as Patent Application with this antenna design. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Glenda Morgan at glenda.m.morgan@nasa.gov or fax to (256) 961-7723 not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 4, 2013.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<a href="mailto:debbie.r.matthews@msfc.nasa.gov">Debbie R. Matthews</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a wide range of administrative support services to various NASA/MSFC programs and projects. Currently, OHC supports general administrative support services, record maintenance, desktop processing, TDY support processing and human resource automated and transactional processing.	Additional support includes paralegal support and temporary management support assistance, at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and other Government-provided facilities.  The OHC organization must understand the direction of the Agency and the Center, anticipate Center needs and requirements, and be responsive, prompt, and effective in providing its day-to-day services. OHC customers and partners are managers, Center employees. This action will allow NASA/MSFC to continue receiving admnistrative support services from Deltha Critique Joint Venture (DCJV), without disruption and at the appropriate levels, throughout the Center and through the upcoming Center reorganization. These services are required to meet the Agencys needs.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Deltha Critique Joint Venture (DCJV). Competition is impractical, at this time, for the following reasons: 1.  DCJV is certified as an 8a, Minority Owned Business.  A number of Agency changes over the past few years have created an uncertainty in future administrative support requirements at the Center (e.g., reduction in the overall NASA budget resulted in significant reductions in available Center institutional funds, retirement of the NASA Space Shuttle Program, Center reorganization to support new mission assignments, and attrition of administrative support personnel).  The Marshall OHC was driven to explore the changing environment, and specifically how the administrative support requirements of the Center were evolving.  OHC recently completed an Administrative Workforce Study Project to address the impacts of several of these factors on the administrative workforce at the Center and is in the process of finalizing a resulting plan of action. Given the timing of this effort, it would be extremely difficult to establish the requirements for a contract re-competition during the implementation of the OHC Plan.  Due to the nature of the services provided, the amount of training required on Center administrative processes, and need for continued administrative support services without a break in service, offerors other than DCJV are not being solicited for this bridge action. The bridge is a means of temporarily fulfilling the Governments essential need for administrative support services and will be utilized only until a follow-on competitive contract can be awarded.  DCJV has performed exceptionally well, comprising almost 60% of the Centers total administrative support workforce.  They support not only OHC requirements, but customers Center-wide and at MAF with general administrative support.  Given the amount of work done on a daily and monthly basis, it is clear that a break in services would have a severe, negative impact on the Center in fulfilling their overall work requirements. 2.  The 12-month extension would provide the Center time to define detailed requirements for an administrative workforce that can be the most responsive to the needs of the Center following its reorganization, and the most effective given the dynamics of an ever growing contractor segment of the administrative workforce.  The MSFC will utilize this time to   undergo extensive research of the 8(a) market to support these requirements. It is also contemplated that this effort be obtained via a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and this extension would provide time to research this possibility and the market to support it.  MSFC intends to initiate a competitive procurement for the CAS follow-on requirements in June 2013, which will result in contract start June 1, 2014.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 8, 2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.	 Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial items contract to Irvine Access Floors, Inc. located at 9425 Washington Blvd., Suite Y-WW, Laurel, Maryland, 20723 to provide raised floor boxes for use with the Communications Intergrators, Inc. (Cii) under floor power distribution system. It is necessary to use genuine Cii parts because these are the only parts that will match the pin configuration. The Pin Configuration of the Cii Wiring System is custom to SSA, and no other manufacturer?s materials will fit and operate in the system properly. The use of this brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Part 13 and FAR 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. It is SSA?s belief that Irvine Access Floors, Inc. is the only sour! ce qualified to meet our needs because of it is the only authorized distributor of Cii parts and materials for the Baltimore, MD region. This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to Adrianna Shaney via email at Adrianna.Shaney@ssa.gov no later than 4:30pm, EST, January 28, 2013.

<p>Please also view the attached DRAFT statement of work.</p>
<p>The request for quote will be released on or about 31 January 2013.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK: <br />The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a web-based content management system and solution and to acquire professional services for development of the replacement web-based Workforce3One.org system through an out-sourced hosted solution with ongoing support for web development, maintenance and operational support.</p>
<p>The Workforce3One.org was implemented approximately seven (7) years ago in support of the Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) business objectives, with a major [platform?] upgrade four (4) years ago.</p>
<p>The Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) is the office within the Employment and Training Administration responsible for providing national leadership, oversight, policy guidance, and technical assistance to the One-Stop system and the youth and adult employment and training programs funded under the Workforce Investment Act. It oversees the development and implementation of the nation's workforce and economic information system. At the heart of the American Job Centers (formally called One-Stop Career Centers) is the ability to provide services to businesses seeking skilled workers, employment assistance to individuals and workforce and economic information services to all customers. The One Stop delivery system provides universal access to an integrated array of labor exchange services so that workers, job seekers and businesses can find the services they need in one stop and frequently under one roof in easy-to-find locations.</p>
<p>In addition, OWI provides similar leadership, oversight, policy guidance and technical assistance related to the Employment Service functions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, which focuses on providing a variety of employment related labor exchange services including but not limited to job search assistance, job referral, and placement assistance for job seekers, re-employment services to unemployment insurance claimants, and recruitment services to employers with job openings.</p>
<p>Workforce3One.org supports the goals and objectives of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA) by providing a repository for the accumulated technical assistance resources that are used to advance the public workforce system. Workforce3One.org's target audience is not the public at large, but rather the nation's workforce professional audience at the Federal, state, and local levels, including non-governmental organizations and associated individuals. The target audience is estimated at 100,000-200,000 individuals nationally.</p>
<p>Anticipated Labor Categories:</p>
<p>Program Manager<br />Web Design/Developer<br />System Administrator<br />Database Administrator<br />Senior Business Analyst<br />IT Security Specialist</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to have a one year base period and four options to be exercised annually.</p>
<p>The contract type will be firm-fixed price contract.</p>
<p>Only one contractor will be selected for a single contract award.</p>

Option 1 would not be a viable solution if all other pools have been awarded.  If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the un-awarded capacity.

NY).   <br>  <br> The proposed maintenance dredging and beach nourishment work would involve a Basic Schedule that requires dredging and placement of approximately 1,500,000 cubic yards of material at Rockaway Beach.  The East Rockaway Inlet project is scheduled to be dredged to a depth of 14 feet plus 2 feet allowable over-depth or deeper based on the availability of material.  The Rockaway Inlet Federal Navigation Channel is scheduled to be dredged to a depth of 20 feet plus 2 feet allowable over-depth or deeper based on the availability of material.  The material dredged from the Inlets will be place along the Rockaway Beaches, approximately between  Beach 19th Street and Beach 149th Street.  The proposed work can be performed by either a pipeline or hopper dredge with pump-out capacity and an ability to withstand open ocean conditions.   <br>  <br> The apparent low bidder shall be officially notified by the contracting officer to submit the following information: a) name, location, point of contact, b) evidence of the daily production capability and the output rates of at least 12,500 cubic yards per day for their proposed integrated system of dredging and placement.  In addition, a synopsis (narrative detailing the operation to move the dredged material from the dredging site to its final resting place) of the proposed operation is also to be submitted by the apparent low bidder.  Bidders should consult with Section 00 80 00 paragraph 1A.1 of the Specifications for detailed submittal requirements.  <br>  <br> The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than one hundred and sixty (160) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed.  It is anticipated that dredging and disposal would take place within the approximate time period of March 2013 through August 2013. The work is estimated to cost over $15,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 1 February 2013 with bid opening on/about 1 March 2013. <br>  <br> Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52.219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the contract. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business subcontracting goals for USACE New York District are as follows: Small Business 50.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 17.0%, Women-Owned Small Business 18.0%, HubZone Small Business 10.0%, Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0% and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 4.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated, shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal cannot be met. You may contact the District, Deputy of Small Business or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HubZone Small Business and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. <br>  <br> The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet.

Background - In October 1996, Congress enacted the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-262.  Eligibility Reform transformed the VA health care system from an episodic, inpatient care provider into a comprehensive health care provider and expanded eligibility for health care to all Veterans.  To manage resources, the law required VA to implement a priority based enrollment system and to annually assess the resources required to provide care to enrolled Veterans.  In 1998, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning (ADUSH/PP) partnered with an actuarial consulting firm to develop the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to project Veteran demand for VA health care.
The development of the EHCPM requires an extensive collaborative effort between VA and its actuarial consultant.  The actuarial consultant provides actuarial and analytical expertise and access to leading experts on health care trends, management efficiencies, and the broader health care environment.  ADUSH/PP leads EHCPM development and enhancements, collaborates with VA program offices and outside organizations to support the EHCPM, and communicates with stakeholders on the EHCPM methodology and projections.  VA program offices, field staff, and research staff provide expertise on the Veteran enrollee population, VA programs and initiatives, and the VA health care system.  
The EHCPM is an actuarial model for projecting Veteran enrollment and demand for VA health care for 20 years into the future. The projections and supporting analyses are central in the development of the VA medical care budget, strategic, capital, and workforce planning, and policy analysis.  VA is dependent on the EHCPM projections to support the development of approximately 92 percent of the VA medical care budget.  The ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants use the EHCPM to provide insight on Veteran demand for VA health care to VA, the Office of Management and Budget, Congress, the Government Accountability Office, Congressional Budget Office, Veteran Service Organizations, and other stakeholders.  
For each of the 20 projection years, the EHCPM projects the number of Veterans expected to be enrolled in a geographic area, their total health care needs, and the portion of that care they are expected to receive in VA versus from other health care providers.  The expenditure projections that support the VA health care budget request are based on the anticipated costs associated with the projected utilization of services (not projected numbers of patients).  A key function of the EHCPM is the ability to modify the underlying assumptions in order to produce projections results for multiple scenarios assuming any of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.
The EHCPM currently projects utilization for 81 health care service categories, including long-term care services.  Generally, the services VA provides that are comparable to services provided in the private sector are modeled using private sector-based utilization benchmarks.  Services that are unique to VA (e.g., blind rehabilitation) or services where VA's practice pattern differs significantly from the private sector (e.g., prosthetics) are modeled using VA experienced-based utilization benchmarks.
The EHCPM accounts for the impact of the following attributes when projecting Veteran enrollment and use of VA health care services:
"	Enrollee age, gender, morbidity, and geographic migration patterns
"	Enrollee reliance on VA health care versus other health care providers
"	Enrollee income, local unemployment rates, and travel distance to VA facilities
"	Enrollee transition between enrollment priorities, e.g., movement into service connected priorities and transitions due to changes in income
"	Unique utilization patterns of various population cohorts, such as females, new enrollees, specific age cohorts, and veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND).  
"	New policies, regulations, and legislation and changes in the broader environment, such as the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit
"	VA health care initiatives, such as the mental health capacity improvement initiative
"	A continually evolving VA health care system, e.g., quality and efficiency initiatives
"	Future changes in health care practice and technology.
The EHCPM has evolved into a very complex health actuarial model to account for all of the known drivers of Veteran demand for VA health care.  Projections are developed at a very detailed level-by 13 enrollment priorities (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7a, c, 8a, b, c, d), two genders, and 14 five-year age bands.  Geographically, projections are developed for sectors, which consist of one or more counties.  In addition, projections are developed separately for enrollees who used VA prior to Eligibility Reform, for OEF/OIF/OND veterans, and for female Veterans.  
The EHCPM is developed using VA actual enrollment, utilization, unit cost, and expenditure data, private sector health care utilization data, nationally recognized actuarial data sets, VA/Medicare enrollee level data match, and quantitative market survey data (e.g., VHA's Survey of Veteran Enrollees).  The EHCPM is supported by in-depth analyses of Veteran enrollment rates, enrollee mortality, morbidity, geographic migration, transition among enrollment priorities, reliance on VA versus other health care providers, and assessments of the impacts of drive time, unemployment rates, and income on demand for VA health care.  As an example of the complexity of the EHCPM, over 150,000 reliance factors that vary by demographic and geographic detail are used in each of the 20 projection years, and these factors vary by projection year.  In addition, stakeholders require that the EHCPM separately quantify the impact of the key drivers of demand for VA health care on enrollment, utilization, and expenditures.  Therefore, the factors that drive VA health care demand must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately. 
The VA health care system and the broader environment are continually changing, and the enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections must reflect the impact of these changes.  This requires that the ADUSH/PP and its actuarial consultants work closely with VA program offices, field staff, and researchers to incorporate their vision for the future delivery of health care services (Patient Aligned Care Team or PACT), the impact of health care initiatives (mental health), the impact of changes in VA's infrastructure, and assess and incorporate the impact of proposed policies (cost sharing), legislation, and regulations (Affordable Care Act), and external events (economic recession) on the VA health care system. 
A key challenge in modeling for the Veteran enrollee population is that enrollees have many other options for health care coverage (private insurance, TRICARE, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.).  As a result, most enrollees only receive a portion of the total health care they need through the VA health care system.  For example, enrollees only choose to receive approximately 20 percent of all of the inpatient care they need from VA.  As a result, VA's internal data sources cannot be exclusively used to project total health care needs of the enrolled Veteran population.  VA must understand enrollees' total health care needs because many internal and external factors can change enrollees' reliance on VA health care.  For services VA provides that are comparable to the private sector, the EHCPM currently utilizes the incumbent's health care benchmarks as a basis to project enrollees' total health care demand.  
Description of Work - To support efforts to understand and project Veteran demand for VA health care, VA requires a health care actuarial consulting firm as prime vendor to provide actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services.  This will be a five-year contract with a base year plus four option periods.
VA requires a wide range of health care actuarial expertise and experience in areas such as morbidity-risk scoring, population and health status assessments, dual or triple eligible populations, U.S. health care trends, health policy analysis, and actuarial modeling capabilities dynamic enough to project utilization for strategic planning at the medical facility-level and at a more global level for budget formulation.  Historically, VA has required a significant volume of consulting hours to meet the needs of stakeholders; however, the volume of hours required is not consistent throughout the year.
A high-level description of the requirements follows.  These tasks will require extensive collaboration with VA and its stakeholders.  This collaboration will be lead by the ADUSH/PP staff.  
"	   Actuarial consulting, modeling, and analytical services to assess the impact of an evolving VA health care system and broader environment on Veteran demand for VA health care. 
Tasks are generally defined and accomplished with internal or external workgroups led by ADUSH/PP staff.  VA and VHA staff that have clinical and programmatic expertise in the task area provide insight into the VA health care system, data, policies, and programmatic guidance. The Contractor will provide the necessary volume of staff with the appropriate technical and analytical expertise to serve on and assist the workgroup.  Together, the workgroup will assess the potential impact on VA and develop assumptions for input into the EHCPM.  A significant volume of the tasks completed each year and the staff mix required are not known in advance.  
"	   Maintain, enhance, and annually update the EHCPM with new data from the most recently completed fiscal year (base year) and other newly available data, update supporting analyses, integrate new or updated assumptions and enhanced methodology, and produce Veteran, enrollment, utilization, and expenditure projections for multiple scenarios assuming any or all of the underlying assumptions change over the 20-year projection period.  
The annual EHCPM update process begins in June and ends the following April.  The enhancements required are developed collaboratively with stakeholders during the update process.  The specifics and the number of EHCPM projection scenarios that VA will require are not known in advance.
The EHCPM consists of four main component projection models.  The methodology, supporting analyses, and assumptions for the 2012 EHCPM are documented in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  
"	Veteran and enrollment projection model
"	Utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks
"	Utilization projection model based on VA experience based utilization benchmarks
"	Unit cost projection model  
The EHCPM has evolved over the past twelve years into a complex model designed to meet stakeholders' needs.  The Contractor will assume responsibility for maintaining and updating EHCPM as currently structured.  The EHCPM will continue to evolve from its current state to meet stakeholders' needs, and the Contractor will be a key partner with VA in defining how the EHCPM evolves to meet those needs. VA will provide the necessary data, documentation of the methodology and assumptions, and the SAS code that constitutes the EHCPM in its current state.
Contractors will need to propose a comparable methodology or benchmarks for the utilization projection model based on private sector utilization benchmarks.  This methodology must meet the objective of projecting Veteran enrollees' total demand for health care services and the portion of that demand that enrollees will receive in VA for services modeled using this model at the level of detail identified in the 2012 VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model Documentation and Analysis Report, September 2012.  In addition, the factors that drive utilization of VA health care services must be analyzed and input into the EHCPM separately.
Responses to this notice shall be e-mailed or faxed to Clifford Snipe, Contract Specialist, FAX 540 479-8450; e-mail address: clifford.snipe@va.gov.   Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received in writing no later than 3:00 p.m. EST February 4, 2013. Responses should clearly state their ability to provide actuarial consulting services and maintain the VA Enrollee Health Care Projection Model.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be announced at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from their response to this announcement.

<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Air Force is seeking potential contractors who are interested in providing engineering services to the A-10 System Program Office (SPO). This notification is a request for information to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, data or data-rights, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for the A-10 SPO at Hill Air Force Base, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished. This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid. To be considered as a potential source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit data in response to the future solicitation, verifying capabilities to meet the requirements on solicitation. The contractor is requested to respond to this RFI as identified in the "Responses" section of this RFI. Based on the "Notes" section of this RFI, it shall not be construed that the Government for contractor responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The A-10 SPO is the primary integrator for all modifications and sustainment changes for the weapon system and the current and anticipated dynamic battlefield environments drive many modernization and sustainment changes to the A-10 legacy aircraft, creating unique requirements to maintain the A-10 throughout its life cycle. Modifications affecting all A-10 functional areas and interfaces to include mechanical, structural, electrical, avionics, weapons, support equipment and operational flight programs (OFP), continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. <br />Starting with the A-10 Wing Replacement Program (WRP), the A-10 SPO has implemented Siemens Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) products for configuration and control of 3D models and all associated technical data. The currently owned and used products are the basic TeamCenter Configuration Management Module and the TeamCenter In-service (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO)) module. As a result of the success on the WRP, the A-10 SPO is expanding the use of Siemens PLM technology and processes for other elements and lifecycle processes of the A-10 aircraft. The A-10 WRP TeamCenter Steering Committee has developed an implementation outline including such capabilities to include but not limited to additional functionality for engineering, interfaces with USAF systems, support for commodities, supplier interaction, and depot support. As the use of TeamCenter PLM technology and processes spreads beyond the WRP's current release, a more detailed implementation strategy, roadmap and plan is required. This plan needs to consider and dovetail with the Air Force PLM Initiative (PLMi) strategy plan, the A-10 SPO realignment with Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Fighters and Bombers Program Executive Office (PEO) and the Siemens PLM product roadmap. A-10 SPO requires support to develop and execute such an implementation strategy, roadmap, and plan.<br />The goal of the new A-10 SPO Process, System Design and Implementation Support services is threefold: <br />a. Refine/Develop a Strategy and Implementation Plan for the continual improvement and expansion of the current TeamCenter environment for configuration management across the rest of the weapon system.<br />b. Refine/Develop, map and document standard logistics and engineering processes and procedures and their information technology interfaces for the sustainment of the A-10 in the AF inventory.<br />c. Further develop standard engineering processes and policy (tools, templates and training) for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>This effort is to acquire engineering services to identify new and developing technologies that can support the accomplishment of A-10 missions and either eliminate or minimize operational and/or sustainability gaps. The Contractor will have to perform integrated systems engineering to deconflict and integrate A-10 baselines, architecture, programs and processes. These include the necessary tools, templates and training for efficient future acquisition and sustainment of the A-10 aircraft. Specific tasks include the provision of a deconfliction matrix, updates, integration and support of products, views or documents called out in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the analysis for the Support Equipment Roadmap, baseline maintenance, A-10 Weapon System Management Environment (AWSME) maintenance, TeamCenter software support, and configuration technical support . The Contractor must obtain applied knowledge of current Air Force Systems and maintenance engineering processes, as well as logistics management best practices using ERP/APS processes in governmental agencies. Additional knowledge specifically related to Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force logistics goals, objectives, and current practices is also required. The Contractor must be familiar with the DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) 2.0, as well as the documents listed in the Appendices of the PWS.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a complete tool or essential subsystems for a Specialized Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to support research in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility as a shared resource accessible to researchers from industry, academia, NIST, and other government agencies through collaboration. The system will be used for the development of new measurement methods for multi-mode imaging of structures and processes in liquids and dense gaseous environmental cells correlated with nanoscale X-ray tomography.
<p>This is a sources sought notice for market research purposes.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order(s) for the complete system and/or for the essential sub-systems.</p>
<p>If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The development of new measurement tools and methods for nanoscale characterization that can subsequently be made available to users is a critical part of the CNST mission. Measurements of processes at solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces, and in dense gaseous or liquid environments are needed in many areas, including the development of new materials and technologies for energy conversion and storage.</p>
<p>This specialized microscope shall meet the following functional requirements:</p>
<p>1. The microscope shall have a long lifetime, high stability field emission electron gun (FEG) with sufficiently high probe current for efficient performance of nanoscale X-ray tomography, rapid elemental mapping, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX). A probe current of 100 nA or higher is desired. The vendor shall specify the highest probe current achievable.</p>
<p>2. The microscope shall be capable of operating in standard scanning electron microscope (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) imaging modes in vacuum as well as at elevated pressures typical for environmental electron microscopes. The operation at elevated pressures is mainly required to protect the tool in case of a breakdown of an environmental cell. The vendor shall specify the operating pressure range.</p>

<DESC>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background<br />The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to help ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications and co-infections, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies. Reliable laboratory data are important for the meaningful interpretation of therapeutic and prevention clinical trials/studies and for the appropriate management of subjects enrolled in these studies. Immunological tests, as well as frozen peripheral mono-nuclear cells (PBMC) for future or off-site testing, are included in many DAIDS-supported trials. It is, therefore, important to evaluate objectively the ability of laboratories to process PBMC and perform tests reliably, and to enhance laboratory performance by providing assistance and training when deficiencies are identified.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to continue to provide a Immunology Quality Assessment Program (IQA) resource to: (1) evaluate the abilities of U.S. and non-U.S. laboratories to accurately and reliably perform study-specified immunological tests (with focus on CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphocyte counts and percentages) and viable PBMC freezing; (2) advise and train when deficiencies are identified; (3) evaluate immunology-based novel technologies (with focus on novel, simple tests for diagnosis and disease monitoring) for implementation in multi-site NIAID trials; and (4) maintain a computerized data management system and document library that includes lab performance data and guidance documents.</p>
<p>The current Immunology Quality Assessment (IQA) Program contract was awarded to Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, on September 30, 2007 for a total period of seven years.<br /><br />Currently, the IQA supports approximately 70 CD4 laboratories in the U.S. and approximately 45 non-U.S. CD4 laboratories in 17 countries. The IQA also supports approximately 65 U.S. PBMC processing laboratories as well as approximately 30 such laboratories in 12 countries. The IQA will continue to support laboratories that are part of current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/daids/networks/pages/daidsnetworks.aspx).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a potential need to: (1) expand the number of non-U.S. CD4 laboratories serviced by the IQA during the course of the contract; and (2) expand the number of U.S. and non-U.S. PBMC processing laboratories serviced by the IQA during the course of the contract. Increases in effort for these services would be implemented through the exercise of contract options, at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The Contractor shall provide support to: (1) evaluate the abilities of U.S. and non-U.S. laboratories to accurately and reliably perform study-specified immunological tests and viable PBMC freezing; (2) advise and train when deficiencies are identified; (3) evaluate immunology-based novel technologies for implementation in multi-site NIAID trials; and (4) maintain a computerized data management system and document library that includes lab performance data and guidance documents.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>1. Monitoring laboratories ability to perform accurately and reliably study-specified immunological tests (e.g. flow cytometric determination of CD4 and CD8 T cell lymphocytes and their subsets, serum/plasma levels of various cytokines and chemokines). This shall include preparation of proficiency testing panels and distribution to participating laboratories, capture and statistical analysis of test results, determination of performance acceptability and generation of lab-specific performance reports.</p>
<p>2. Monitoring laboratories' ability to viably freeze PBMC. This shall include receipt of frozen samples from participating laboratories, determination of cell viability and yields, determination of acceptable performance and generation of lab-specific performance reports.</p>
<p>3. Providing assistance, guidance and training in corrective action when Lab's testing performance is unacceptable, including assistance with procedures and Standard Operating Procedures related immunological tests and PBMC freezing, laboratory qualify management and instrument/test validation. The contractor must have experience with creating and utilizing training tools and must have staff able to travel to various laboratories in and outside the U.S. to provide training.</p>
<p>4. Evaluating new immunological instruments/assays (e.g. point-of-case CD4 <br />methodologies) by conducing in-house preliminary studies as well as facilitating multi-lab studies to determine the suitability of implementing these instruments/assays in vaccine, prevention and therapeutic studies.</p>
<p>5. Obtaining materials and reagents needed for the preparation of quality control materials (QCMs) used to prepare proficiency testing panels and for method evaluation studies. Examples of QCMs include cells and plasma from a well characterized pool of HIV-infected (e.g. CD4 and viral load levels, HLA type) and non-infected donors, labeled monoclonal antibodies, mitogens, pathogen-specific antigens and commercial reference standards and reagents.</p>
<p>6. Hosting and maintaining an existing IQA computerized data management system and document library to track and make available documents in support of activities performed under the contract. The contractor must have the ability to maintain the computerized system security documentation as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be expected to have experience and expertise to carry out a project of this size and complexity, must understand cultural sensitivity issues relevant to resource-constrained countries, and must have the flexibility to address emerging needs and expansion.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about June 30, 2014. The requirement will be for the delivery of 6.50 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may unilaterally exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional non-U.S. CD4 laboratories: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional laboratories to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 10 Laboratories. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional .30 FTEs per option. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the Base year or Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional US and non-U.S. PBMC processing laboratories: During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional laboratories to support new NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 10 Laboratories. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional .35 FTEs per option.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; or veteran owned small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch (MCGNRB) is to support fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying and influencing brain development, neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, signal transduction pathways, and the biochemical and behavioral actions of therapeutic agents in animals and humans. The goals of the MCGNRB include the identification of novel targets (genes or molecules) for therapeutic intervention, characterization of the neurobiological behavioral actions of psychoactive agents, and design and development of novel ligands for functional brain imaging in humans, psychoactive agents for basic and clinical research, and potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of mental disorders.</p>
<p>To further these goals, a contract for the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) was initiated to provide broad-based screening capabilities, in the form of pharmacological and functional assays, and receptor binding data (Ki values) to the scientific research community with the intent of stimulating innovative research and development efforts in the design and development of novel psychoactive compounds for preclinical research, neuroimaging, and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The program focuses on the use of state-of-the-art, high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds in human and rodent CNS receptor binding and functional assays.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. <br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing screening and testing services to continue a project entitled, " NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program". This project was first initiated in 1992. The purpose of this initiative is to continue services to (1) establish and validate assays for cloned human or rodent receptors by cloning a receptor, maintaining a stably transfected cell line expressing the receptor, and establishing the binding and functional assays for the receptor in accordance with standards established in the published scientific literature; (2) conduct high-throughput screening of compounds in broad-based primary and secondary pharmacological assays (radioligand binding and enzyme assays), functional assays, high-throughput patch clamp electrophysiology assays, and assays to assess brain penetrance, potential bioavailability, and cardiac toxicity (Note - the screening services are intended primarily as a screen for compounds that have previously been shown to possess pharmacological, biochemical, or behavioral activities relevant to NIMH, rather than for the purpose of large-scale, random screening of natural products or combinatorial libraries) (3) provide an electronic data file of screening results for each compound suitable for inclusion in a scientific publication; and (4) update and maintain a Ki database for compounds and drugs.</p>
<p>Project requirements:</p>
<p>The PDSP was developed to provide screening of novel synthetic compounds and natural products for potential use as research tools or probes for basic and clinical research, as therapeutic agents for mental disorders, and as PET, SPECT, and fMRI ligands for functional brain imaging.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses must demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise and capability to receive and test up to 3,000 individual samples per year and up to 5,000 plated samples (synthetic compounds, small molecules, gene products, and natural product extracts) per year, in a wide variety of human and rodent CNS receptor and enzyme screening assays and functional assays, and to provide an electronic data file for each of the screened compounds. A list of targets of interest to NIMH can be found at http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdspw/clones.php. Samples for screening can include, but are not limited to, novel chemical entities, structural analogs of lead compounds, genes or gene products, small molecules, enzyme inhibitors, and natural products.</p>
<p>Based on historical data, a projected annual assay workload could be up to: 1) 20,000 primary pharmacological assays; 5,000 secondary pharmacological assays; 100,000 functional assays; 1300 brain penetrance, bioavailability, or toxicity assays; and 5-10 new assays developed and validated. These are estimates, which can fluctuate on a yearly basis. Small businesses should demonstrate they can provide these services up to the stated quantities. Since these are estimates, capacities above the estimated assay workload are considered preferable.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />The estimated period of performance is June 30, 2013 - June 29, 2018<br />Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>The contractor shall use Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to conduct all aspects of the contract.</p>
<p>Capability statement/information sought:</p>
<p>Any small business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a narrative response indicating previous experience and capabilities related to this work.</p>
<p>Capability Statements should clearly state/describe your ability to carry out the services above, including:</p>
<p>1) information regarding your (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) experience and qualifications to perform this work, including the capacity to meet or exceed the estimated workload<br />2) respondent's DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUB Zone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541711, 500 employees); <br />4) information on the management structure and history of your organization, and <br />5) Any other resources available to perform this work.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to limit your response to fewer than 10 pages and must specifically address each of the requirement specific items requested.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 519190 with a small business size standard of $7 million. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research ONLY. <br /><br />1. BACKGROUND<br />This project relates to the continued building, updating, and maintenance of LactMed, a searchable database of records on drugs and their use during lactation. LactMed is an addition to the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP). Although TEHIP databases currently provide some information on drug pharmacology and toxicology, efforts are underway to enhance TEHIP with even greater information on the pharmacology and toxicology of drugs and related products. Drug information is an integral component of a comprehensive toxicology program, and expanded coverage complements existing chemical substance and other data records. The LactMed database is accessible through TOXNET, an Internet-based system for TEHIP online databases (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov), and is linked with other databases such as the Hazardous Substances Data Bank which has about 1,000 drug-related records.</p>
<p>The LactMed database was created, and needs to continue to evolve, because information available to healthcare providers is usually derived from approved drug product labeling, which often differs from expert opinion. Of the relatively few sources of information on this subject, such labeling typically does not provide critical evaluations of the primary literature. An evidence-based, comprehensive database on drugs and lactation made available in the public domain, LactMed was designed to help support medical decision-making by healthcare professionals. The database is evidence-based with source attribution, and made available in the public domain. LactMed complements the suite of databases that comprise TOXNET, which is maintained by the Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of NLM. Database records are linked, where appropriate, to other TOXNET and NLM database records. In order to ensure consistency and data currency, the Contractor will continue to build the database over the duration specified in this purchase order, for a period of one year, plus two optional extension years. The database is written primarily for healthcare professionals, with recommendations written at a level that is also understandable to consumers.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES<br />The rationale behind this project is to continue to expand and enhance LactMed, a database on possible adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription drugs, relevant herbals, nutraceuticals, and diagnostic agents in infants that result from transmission during human breast-feeding. The database needs to be a principal focus of the Contractor who has both the subject expertise and resources to accomplish this project expeditiously. <br /><br />3. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />A. Compile the world's professional and scientific literature relating to the use of drugs and related products during human lactation. Organize this literature into a professionally acceptable system for ease of access to articles on specific drugs and, where appropriate, classes of pharmacologic and/or therapeutic agents. Drug names should be at the generic level and include, at a minimum, United States Adopted Names. Further, the Contractor must be willing to have such data placed in the public domain, without any intellectual property right constraints or fees imposed with respect to its use. While the database will become the property of NLM, this will not preclude the Contractor from reconfiguring or otherwise using the source data for preparing other information products or publications. The database content must be fully supported by an evidence-based approach that involves critical case evaluations of reports in peer-reviewed literature.</p>
<p>B. At a minimum, database records should include the drug names specified above, drug class(es), pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data such as drug concentrations in breast milk and infant serum, time course of such levels, and weight-adjusted percent of maternal dose in breast milk, when it can be determined from case report evaluations and other analyses of published literature, provide possible drug effects on maternal lactation and in breast-fed infants, indicating a quantifiable probable causation. Information should also be provided with respect to those drugs that present no safety problems if the scientific literature specifically makes that determination. All drug data within records must follow the approved drug record template, and be referenced to available source references.</p>
<p>4. ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for one year from the date of award with two additional one-year option periods.<br /><br />5. CAPABILITY STATEMENT/INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Capabilities of Organization<br />Because of the high public health significance of the LactMed database, its importance to mothers and infants, and the need to ensure highly accurate and scientifically credible information and guidance, this project should be overseen by a world class expert on the effects of drugs on breastfeeding. Ideally, the candidate will be acknowledged as such by his peers, professional scientific societies, and the lactation community, and be widely published in the areas of drug use and breastfeeding. Service on relevant editorial boards or scientific advisory committees will also bolster the vendors credentials. The candidate should have a strong background in reviewing the scientific literature on drugs and lactation and be familiar in building online databases in this or related areas. The vendor should also be able to summarize retrieved data to offer guidance for breastfeeding mothers and their physicians on the advisability of continuing with certain medications and be able to suggest alternative products where warranted. A Doctor of Pharmacy degree might be a good educational platform upon which a vendor could establish drug and lactation expertise.</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:<br />(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills, and ability to fulfill the Government's requirement. The capability statement should be complete and contain sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding capabilities; however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement must identify the responder's business type and size; DUNS number; NAICS code, and technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 12:00 pm local prevailing time on Wednesday, January 30, 2013 to Kimberly Pringle at pringlek@mail.nih.gov.</p>

<DESC>C-130 Weapon System<br />Solicitation Number: FA8252-13-R-AAAA<br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Force Materiel Command<br />Location: Hill AFB OO-ALC
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force is planning an acquisition strategy for the follow-on production of the C-130 Ball Screw Assembly, NSN 1620012636733/Part Number 8430M4. The C-130 Ball Screw Assembly requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source requires acquisition of the part from the approved source. The approved source retains data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued production of highly specialized components.</p>
<p>The C-130 Ball Screw Assembly is a unique design item, due to special manufacturing heat treat processes, tolerances, and the operational environments for which it was designed. The assembly consists of 80 major components which are composed of a variety of subcomponents. Of the major components and subcomponents, approximately 82 are sole source on this assembly. At least two (2) assemblies must be destroyed to determine the material properties, due to a special heat treat process utilized on some of the major components of this assembly. Once this is completed, a one-year field service evaluation is required. The majority of the items are limited to the qualified source and the design specifications are controlled by the aircraft Original Equipment Manufacturer.</p>
<p><br />The estimated award date is 5 JUN 2013 with performance expected up to 5 DEC 2014. First delivery of fully qualified production units is to begin within 6 months of award. The current estimate for delivery quantities is as follows: 5 DEC 2013 - 619 units, 5 JUN 2014 - 359 units, 5 DEC 2014 - 289 units. This delivery schedule must be met or exceeded. <br />Note: The C-130 Ball Screw Assembly and associated interface data is contractor proprietary and therefore not available. Any required qualification or integration testing costs, such as a First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) program, would be applied to the production price. The contractor must provide adequate production, test and logistics (warranty) support to ensure and maintain operational readiness and suitability of the C-130 weapon system for a minimum of 20 years. <br />This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government's intention to pay for information solicited at this time. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Christine Fukuda/ AFSC OL:H/PZAAB, (801) 777-6466. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman is Mr. Kevin Flinders/PKC, (801) 777-4392. <br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this synopsis. Information submitted should be addressed to AFSC OL:H/PZAAB, Attn: Ms. Christine Fukuda, 6050 Gum Lane Bldg 1215, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825.</p>

<DESC>***THIS SPECIAL AWARD NOTICE IS BEING POSTED LATE DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR.  DUE TO ADMINISTRATIVE ERROR, AUTOMATIC AWARD POSTING THROUGH THE CONTRACT AWARD SYSTEM DID NOT TAKE PLACE*** <br> The United States Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center awarded a 6-month Time-and-Materials type UCA contract on a non-competitive basis to DRS Technical Services Inc. of Herndon, VA under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source for the procurement of Rapid Response Support Services. The 50% NTE UCA amount was $11,400,000.00. <br> This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there was only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services that would have satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br> This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a time-and-materials type action was awarded. <br> This effort provides infrastructure and information management systems to the Army. It develops, acquires and deploys tactical and management IT systems and products through its various project and product managers including Project Manger Defense <br> Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS) and PD DWTS.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-519-5770<br />Name:		Cover, Certificate-Document, Gold Foil Stamped, Black<br />Description:	Certificate-document cover with gold foil stamped front cover. Certificate-document cover is from a die-cut design and can hold an 8 1 /2 x 11", 8" x 10" or an A4-size portrait or landscape oriented certificate award or document. Made with 80-lb. linen finished stock paper. UOI is PG. PG = 5.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-01-519-5771<br />Name:		Cover, Certificate-Document, Gold Foil Stamped, Blue<br />Description:	Blue certificate award-document cover with gold foil stamped front cover. Certificate-document cover from a is die-cut design and can hold an 8 1 /2 x 11", 8" x 10" or an A4-size portrait or landscape oriented certificate award or document. Made with 80-lb. linen finished stock paper. UOI is PG. PG = 5.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-01-519-5770<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	None reported</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-01-519-5771<br />ETS Stock Numbers: 	GEO-45332; ESS-29900-235BGD</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 8, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to&nbsp;(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

Therefore, the vendor should not proffer courses which are "developmental" or in any way not available at the date of award. The FBI does not require the provider to provide these courses solely to the FBI or at an FBI facility, rather it is acceptable to provide seats on an enrollment basis. Based on market research conducted, the previous year's competition returning only one responsible and a sources sought notice released for a two week period, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by The SANS Institute, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Cyber Career Path Program with an ANSI Accredited certification to meet the FBI's requirements.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 4:00 pm, EST, by July 12, 2012, by email to the attention of Todd M. Townsend, Contract Specialist, at todd.townsend@ic.fbi.gov with the subject line: "CCPP Capabilities Statement." Conforming information received will be considered by the technical team, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should the Government receive one or more viable quotes, this RFQ will subject to a directed competition between The SANS Institute and the capable vendor(s). Should the Government receive no viable quote(s), the award will be made solely to The SANS Institute. <br /><br />The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) is soliciting technical/cost proposals for research and development support in technologies that are applicable to Communications Relay, Electro-Optical (EO), Radio Frequency (RF), Acoustic Sensors, Manned and Unmanned Airborne Payloads, Persistent Surveillance Technologies, Unattended Ground Sensors (UGS), and Special Sensor Systems for Navy Aircraft and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). Technologies proposed should emphasize rapid development, Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E), and technology insertion to the warfighter.<br />2. BACKGROUND <br />The Avionics Department (AIR-4.5) develops advanced sensors (Acoustics, EO, Radar, Magnetics, and other special sensors) and systems. The purpose of these sensors and surveillance systems is to support a variety of Aviation missions including Air-Under-Sea-Warfare (USW), Airborne Strike, Air Warfare, Counter-Air, Close Air Support and Interdiction, Defense Suppression, Electronic Attack, Naval Warfare and Amphibious Strike, and Anti-Surface Warfare. Most of the sensors will be air deployed (via manned or unmanned aircraft), but ground, surface and undersea deployable sensors will also be included when mission driven.<br /><br />This BAA not only includes the sensors, sensor data processing and sensors systems, but mathematical modeling of the sensor, communication techniques between the sensors and/or platforms, interfaces, the fusion and exploitation of multi-sensor data, and any other technique to develop advanced capabilities and to reduce the cost of transitioning sensors technologies into the fleet. Furthermore, the BAA shall cover development and/or analysis of related sensors air, sea and land clutter detection models using relevant sensor data.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<DESC>I. OVERVIEW: This solicitation is a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64 including amendments effective January 18, 2013. This requirement is being set-aside as a Total Small Businesses set aside under NAICS code 333415. Only qualified Offerors may submit responses. The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order.
<p>II. STATEMENT OF NEED: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) has a requirement for the purchase of the following items in the quantity listed;</p>
<p>Quantity: One (1); Electric Steam Humidifier and start-up.<br />Quantity: One (1); BACnet Communication Card</p>
<p>The proposed electric steam humidifier must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. The humidifier shall be electrically heated immersion heater type generating steam from <br />domestic water.</p>
<p>2. The humidifier shall have steam output capacity 30lbs/hr, 10kw/480v/3ph, with 1/15 hp/120v/1ph remote mounted blower.</p>
<p>2. The humidifier shall be tested and approved by ETL Testing Laboratories, Inc.</p>
<p>3. The humidifier shall have an evaporating reservoir with a gasket-sealed cover that is capable of operating at pressures of at least 19" (48 cm- W.C.) without steam or water leaks. The reservoir shall be made of type 304 stainless steel with welded joints. Reservoir shall be mounted on slide rails for easy removal from cabinet.</p>
<p>4. The reservoir shall be contained within a cabinet that is constructed of 18-gauge steel with a baked enamel finish. The cabinet floor shall be designed as a drain pan with plumbing connections for drain piping.</p>
<p>5. A surface water flusher shall be included to drain away a portion of the water upon each refill cycle. This is to allow mineral deposits produced by earlier evaporation cycles to be removed. Flusher shall be designed for minimal water waste and efficient flushing.</p>
<p>6. The immersion heater(s) shall be incoloy clad and designed for 80 watts per square inch. They shall be attached to the reservoir cover and be easily removed for cleaning or inspection. Expansion and contraction of the heater sheath allows mineral build-up to flake off.</p>
<p>7. A brass body, solenoid operated water fill valve shall be factory mounted on the cover of the<br />humidifier reservoir. The fill valve shall be located to allow a minimum water gap of 1-1/2" (3.81cm). An inline strainer shall be factory mounted on the fill valve to remove any water-born particulate matter before the humidifier fill valve. The water strainer shall have a removable screen to permit periodic inspection and cleaning.</p>
<p>8. The humidifier shall have a manual reset over temperature switch, factory installed, on the<br />humidifier reservoir. The temperature switch shall provide humidifier over-temperature protection.</p>
<p>9. A solid state, plug-in type control module shall be factory mounted on the control panel and shall electronically control the automatic refilling, low water cut-off, high water cut-off, manual surface water flushing, and safety switch interlock functions. The module shall include automatic drain functions to drain the reservoir. A cumulative timer shall be field adjustable between 10 to 110 hours of operation. When the system is activated the fill valve will be energized to provide a cool-down tempering of the water prior to draining. The control module shall incorporate LED lights to indicate safety switch interruption, power, fill, heat ready, and drain. The control module shall control all water level control functions through a tri-probe sensor mounted on the cover of the humidifier reservoir. The Tri-Probe sensor with stainless steel shield shall electrically sense the water level within the reservoir.</p>
<p>10. The electrical compartment shall be isolated and watertight from the reservoir compartment. The electrical compartment shall be accessible by a hinged and key-locked door. The panel shall include a factory wired sub-panel with magnetic contactor, Tri-Probe water level control module, fused control circuit transformer, numbered terminal block, and heater fuse(s). The high voltage wiring shall be shielded to prevent shock hazard. The modulating control voltage shall be field adjustable to match the controlling input signal.</p>
<p>11. The humidifier shall be supplied with a wall-mount channel bracket for easy wall mounting. The bracket shall be load tested to a 600 pound capacity.</p>
<p>12. Insulation. Unit shall be covered (except top cover) with 3/4" (1.9 cm) thick fiberglass duct insulation. Insulation material shall have aluminum foil facing.</p>
<p>13. Blower Pack. Unit shall allow for direct space humidification without the use of ductwork. Unit shall be contained within a cabinet that is constructed of 18-gauge steel with a baked enamel paint finish. Unit shall have a two-speed field adjustable fan. The fan is controlled by a thermostat interlock mounted on the steam distributor, it shall activate the fan before steam is discharged and deactivate the fan after all residual steam has been discharged. The blower shall be designed for remotely mounted on the wall.</p>
<p>14. Flexible Hose. Provide 16-foot flexible hose and hose clamps between humidifier and blower.</p>
<p>15. SCR Controller. A 100% solid state power controller shall be provided on the control panel with a matching modulating wall humidistat. The SCR power controller will modulate the humidifier between 0-100% of its rated capacity according to humidistat demand.</p>
<p>16. Microprocessor Logic Controller; controller performs self-diagnostics and controls all water level, fill, drain and safety circuit interlocks with fault indication. Programmable for "Flush", "Standby" and "Normal Operation" functions. Also includes:<br />a) 16 character two line display. <br />b) Keypad user interface. <br />c) BAS communications. <br />d) Adjustable input signal filter <br />e) Flash memory <br />f) On-Screen alarm/fault messages. <br />g) Keypad lock-out system.<br />h) Fault alarm contacts.<br />i) Low/High humidity deviation alarm contacts.<br />j) Adjustable P.I.D. parameters.<br />k) Time-to-Service indication.<br />l) Adjustable display brightness</p>

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The National Administrative and Office Supplies Acquisition Center, New York, NY, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 01/25/2013 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to six (6) months before your offer is evaluated. 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website. The SAM website can be accessed at https://www.sam.gov.
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by another refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding Fee provisions. 

This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  Submit eOffers at: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b):52.204-10; 52.209-10;52.219- 28; 52.222-3;52.222-19;  52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.223-18,  52.225-3, 52.225-13, 52.232-33.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (WSS) intends to issue a sole source order to Data Enterprises of the Northwest, Inc. to acquire ATICTS (Automated Tool Inventory Control Tracking System) Software Technical, Training and Maintenance Support.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.,
Prospective offerors who wish to challenge the sole source award or express interest in providing the above services should submit their fully documented challenges or expressions of interest no later than Monday, January 28, 2013 by 3:00 p.m. EST. Please submit your reply via email to Deborah.Thoman@navy.mil.
 Please reference in the subject line RFQ No. N00104-13-Q-Q205.

Sole Source Justification:
This limited source justification and approval is for the negotiation and issuance of a delivery order to acquire ATICTS (Automated Tool Inventory Control Tracking System) Software Technical, Training and Maintenance Support. 

The procurement is for annual support for ATICTS and D3/FlashConnect software Technical, Training and Maintenance Support.  This support is for 62 users at Cherry Point, 63 users at Jacksonville, and 25 users at North Island Fleet Readiness Centers.  This also includes travel for training or technical support.

Data Enterprises of the Northwest, Inc. (DEN) is the developer and manufacturer of TICTS software and supports the Tool Inventory Management Application.
  DEN provides the version updates and help desk support.  DEN has been certified by GSA as the manufacturer and sole provider of the ATICTS software product and owns all the rights to the software code.  
ATICTS utilizes the D3 Multi-Value Database, which is a proprietary product manufactured by TigerLogic Corporation.  Data Enterprises, as a certified value-added reseller (VAR) of D3, is the sole provider of D3 support when ATICTS is the application.  TigerLogic products are not available directly to clients, only through value-added resellers.  Therefore, DEN is the only source able to provide the technical, training and maintenance support.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

<p>COMDTINST 4200.14A - Notice for Filing Agency Protests<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-13-Q-200020 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-63. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Kollsman, Inc (89944). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.<br />It is the Government's belief that Kollsman, Inc. is the only source that has the required technical and engineering data, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.</p>

The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Drawings and specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. <br />Packaging, packing and preservation shall be in accordance with best commercial practices to enable shipment to destination and transshipment to Coast Guard units without repackaging or incurring damage during shipment and handling. Items shall be individually packaged and labeled. Labeling shall include the appropriate national Stock number, Part Number, Nomenclature, quantity, Delivery Order Number and Line Item number.

<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (FEB 2012) with the following included by Addendum:</p>

<p>Evaluation - Commercial Items <br />Quotes will be evaluated and purchase order issued to the lowest priced technically acceptable. <br />Technically Acceptable: Quotes must be for new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.<br />(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations:  Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand.  The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Division Leader in Washington. OFDA's East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO), located in Nairobi, Kenya, also includes multiple Regional Advisors, Program Officers, and administrative staff.  Within this region, OFDA maintains country offices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia.  Staff from the regional and country offices coordinate with OFDA/Washington on all disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation, and training programs for their respective regions.</p>
<p>The Regional Information Officer will be based in the Nairobi office, and will work in conjunction with OFDA's Information Support Unit (ISU) to support information and reporting needs throughout the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one Regional Information Officer in Nairobi, Kenya, to facilitate regular reporting on emergency conditions, response activities, and analysis from the regional office as well as from country offices within the region.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Regional Information Officer will primarily provide full time information support to OFDA's ECARO, located in Nairobi, Kenya.  The Regional Information Officer will collaborate closely with Information Officers on the East and Central Africa team based in Washington, D.C. or on temporary duty within the region to ensure that information is provided and shared in a timely manner, and that OFDA's information needs are met.  When needed, the Regional Information Officer may also travel to other countries in the region to provide information support.  Duties will include collecting, synthesizing, and analyzing information pertaining to humanitarian emergencies and response efforts in the region, and drawing upon that information to produce internal U.S. Government (USG) reports, cables, and success stories or regional newsletters, as well as other duties as directed by the PRA.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial daily coordination with the ISU and several OFDA staff members based in offices throughout the region, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Regional Information Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging, dynamic, fast-paced work environment, and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a USG disaster assessment team, DART, Washington, D.C.-based RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Regional Information Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Attend humanitarian cluster meetings and collaborate closely with information counterparts from UN agencies and NGOs to ensure that all relevant humanitarian information is obtained and incorporated into USAID/OFDA field products, including official cables, and is provided to Washington, D.C.-based Information Officers in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as one of the principal contact points for OFDA in the region for humanitarian reporting issues.  Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID Mission and/or US Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in humanitarian assessments, meetings with USAID/OFDA partners, and site visits, at the discretion of the PRA, in order to obtain information that will be reported to U.S. Embassy and USAID/OFDA headquarters in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain regular contact with the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian reporting issues, as directed by the PRA. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, NGOs, USG personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others.</p>
<p>&bull;	Frequent, short-term travel within the region to report on humanitarian conditions and OFDA responses both independently and as part of a larger team.</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in the preparation of agendas and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to Washington, D.C. as needed for training, consultations with the ISU or ECA team, or to complete a rotation within the ISU or on an RMT.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The Regional Information Officer will take direction from and will report to OFDA's PRA for ECARO or his/her designee, based in Nairobi, Kenya, and maintain close coordination with OFDA's ISU in Washington, D.C.  The ISU will provide appropriate training and quality control feedback to maintain a consistent standard for all OFDA information products.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The supervisor will set overall objectives and determine deadlines and work priorities.  The Regional Information Officer will also communicate directly with the ISU regarding information requirements from the regional team in Washington, D.C. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, work closely with the entire ECARO and regional team based in Washington, D.C., and perform with moderate direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is stated below:
<p>1. Provide answers to the following questions.<br />2. Extend the closing date of the solicitation to&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;01 February&nbsp;2013.<br />3. The primary POC for this requirement is now Stephen Colton at 702-652-6005 or email stephen.colton@nellis.af.mil</p>
<p><br />Question 1:<br />2.3.4 Contractor shall replace all activated carbon and sand filter media during the first year of the contract and at least once every year thereafter, in each system.</p>
<p>Is the cost of the carbon and sand to be included in CLIN 0001?</p>
<p>Answer: <br />No. Please see the attached file. The required format for all quotes has been revised and a separate CLIN has been added for paragraph 2.3.4. Also note that the building number in CLIN 0003 has changed from 768 to 798.<br />Question 2:<br />2.5 ION RESIN EXCHANGE INSTALLATION: Within the first month of the contract, Contractor shall install one mixed bed ion exchange unit to treat water from the Water Maze system prior to the high pressure wash unit at Building 1011 in a manner identical to that at the system in Building 768. Ion exchange resins consisting of mixed cation and anion resins in the hydrogen and hydroxide forms, respectively, and present in equal molar amounts, shall be used in the ion exchange system.<br />Is the cost of this to be included in CLIN 0001? It seems like this should have its own CLIN so that the contractor can be paid for the work immediately rather than it being spread out over 12 months?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>The ION Exchange Resin already has its own CLIN. Please reference CLIN 0003.<br />Question 3:<br />Since this unit is to be installed identical to the system in building 768 can you please provide make and model number of the mixed bed ion exchange unit and pictures of the current installation?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Building 1011 has a Water Maze Model CLPB System, Bio Stax Microbe Solution. <br />It needs to emulate the Water Maze CLP-5024B System in building 798. Pictures of the system in building 798 have been provided.</p>

<DESC>Amendment W91ZLK-13-T-0048 0004 is issued to revise specification 2.a and to answer questions.  The specifications and requirements are in accordance with the revised Specifications Attachment 5, attached.  The closing date of the solicitation remains at January 31, 2013, 1:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.  Please SUBMIT YOUR QUOTATIONS to Ms. Sowa at the Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground - Tennant Division, 6001 Combat Drive, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005.  Quotations must be submitted via email to:  susan.l.sowa.civ@mail.mil. Quotations must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date and time. Additional questions must have been received no later than January 24, 2013, 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.   <br>  <br> Clarification 21:  Modify Requirements 2.a. to read:  File Capacity - Amend/Change requirement to minimum 1,550 lfi and maximum 1,750 lfi. <br>  <br> Question 22:   File capacity, you have changed the specification for the unit capacity from a 1,400 to 2,300 LFI range to a 2,300 to 2,500 LFI range, to a 1,800 to 2,000 LFI range. Is it possible to change that specification to read: vertical carousel system to maximize filing capacity in the existing space or revert back to the original 1,400 to 2,300 LFI range with the understanding that you would compare the offerings based on capacity, the fit in the room, the ability to meet the specifications, and the price (see  specification i)?  Answer:  File Capacity - Amend/Change requirement to min 1550 lfi and max 1750 lfi. <br>  <br> Question 23:  b. and d. Restricted access and doors. It is my impression you would like this unit to have a door that will secure the contents of the unit and allow the unit to run while closed and open to allow access to one row of files. Additionally, it is my impression that you require the access to each level of files in the vertical carousel to be restricted by a password or a pin number. All this is to be done through the units control panel without the use of traditional keys or locks. For example, the user approaches the unit which is closed, he or she enters his pin number and the carrier number he is trying to access, the unit revolves with the door closed to that level and the door opens. This is to be achieved without the use of an external computers or individual keys or locks. Additionally the unit administrator will have the ability to change the access and pin numbers and or the levels that a user may have access to. Have I interpreted these two related specifications correctly?  Answer:  b and d. The technical point of contact believes the vendor has an understanding of the specification, except an external controller or computer for pin is allowed, just no requirement to do audits of entries. <br>  <br> Question 24:  g. Transaction counter. It is my understanding that the unit is to have a fixed transaction counter that runs the full length of the unit that does not need to be folded down or manipulated to allow for access into the room or restrict the ability to open and close the door. Have I interpreted this specification correctly? Answer:  The transaction counter: the system simply needs to be able to allow the user to comfortably access the hanging files from a standing position and the door should not be blocked. The transaction counter facilitates ease of use. <br>   <br>  <br> Question 25:  k. Electrical. If the unit uses a power source that is other than a plug  for 110 standard wall outlet who is responsible for the cost of the hookup or the change required to modify the room or the buildings existing power (this specification seems to be in conflict with specification i)?  Answer:  If 220 volt is a requirement, the government will retrofit the outlet for that specification. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to: 1. Incorporate questions and answers to prospective quoter's questions.
Q1.  Do you have a manufacturer in mind? A1.  No. Q2.  How will the dock be anchored, and shall pilings be included? A2.  Docks will be anchored to pilings at a different date not included for this pricing. Q3.  What are the depths and normal fluctuation? A3.  Docks need to be out of the water 16" to 17" inches. Q4.  What type of decking? A4.  Polyethylene. Q5.  Do the sections need to be pre drilled? A5.  No. Q6.  Does the manufacture provide hardware for connections? A6. No. Q7.  I am not sure what you are asking for. We have plastic floats that are 4' x 8' x 16" They weigh 122 pounds each and have a buoyancy of 2449 pounds. Are you calling that a dock?  A7.  Height out of the water needs to be between 16" and 17".  Each Section is 4' x 8'. Q8.  How are going to connect them to make a 120'dock?  A8.  At this time we are not purchasing hardware to make the connections. Q9.  Do you have a float plan drawing prepared for this application outlining anchorage? A9.  Not at this time.  Again, we are just purchasing 32 sections without hardware.  Q10.  What is the intend use of this structure / Emergency response vessels / law enforcement vessels/ Recreational boaters A10.  Boat Tours. Q11.  Cleating requirements / size/ both sides / one side only/ distance between cleats? A11.  Cleating on one side.  Size not yet determined. Q12.  Fendering requirements / one side/ both sides? A12.  None at this time. Q13.  Anchorage / Spud poles / diameter / quantity/? A13.  Docks are being anchored to pilings. Q14.  Anchorage/ deadman sinkers and weights? A14.  Docks are being anchored to pilings with a ring so docks can slide up and down the piling on river heights. Q15.  Straight line 120 ft Run of float / L configuration/ T configuration / float plan sketch? A15.  Dock's 4 ft. x 8 ft. to create a complete docking area 8 ft. by 120 ft.  Q16.  Does the entire dock have to be constructed of polyethylene or is it just the floats themselves? If it is the entire section that needs to be polyethylene are you open to accepting different sizes to meet the layout requirements. What are the layout & anchoring requirements? A16.  The floating docks need to be polyethylene.  See A1. Q17.  States the following "2.  Fully constructed dock size, shall be 120 feet total 4 feet long by 8 feet wide." Am I correct in assuming this means 1ea. 4' wide x120'long dock dock?  What are you doing with the remaining sections of dock(136')?  Do you need hardware to connect these? A17.  Each floating dock size is 4 ft x 8 ft creating a total of 120 ft. Q18.  Two extra sections are also being purchased for a total of 32 sections." This would be a total dock length of 256'. How does the dock layout? This is very important in terms of anchoring. All we know is that there is a 1ea. 4'x120' dock. A18.  The other two sections get attached so when we purchase the gangway it will rest on these pieces. Q19.  17" freeboard is very high for standard craft <30'. What size boats will be docked to system? This is important for anchoring reasons? Also would you be willing to accept docks with a more standard freeboard of 12"-15". A19.  Needs to be 16 - 17" for the style river boat we are hoping to purchase in an upcoming contract. We cannot accept 12" -15" freeboard. Q20.  Am I correct in assuming installation is not required? A20.  Correct, no installation required. Q21.  What is the primary use of the Docks? A21.  Docks being used for our tour season and education season early spring and early fall. Q22.  How will the Dock(s) be anchored? A22.  These docks will be anchored to pilings that will be installed in a later contract. Q23.  How will user's access dock? Do you have a gangway? A23.  The will access the dock by a boat and gangway which will be purchased in an upcoming contract. Q25.  Does the dock need to meet ADA regulations? A25.  Yes the dock's need to meet ADA regulations. Q26.  Should we provide necessary bumpers and cleats for boaters?  If so how many? A26.  No bumpers or cleats at this time Q27.  This solicitation is clearly geared toward the Connect A Dock product only. If for no other reason that then have a specific mold size of 48"x96"20". Are you willing to accept competitive bids from similar dock system? A27.  We are willing to accept competitive bids but the docks need to be as close to 4 ft x 8 ft as much as possible. Q28.  If so can we add some language to allow for various sizes that meet your overall desired layout goals? A28.  The desired layout goal is to have a enough dock sections to assemble a floating dock that is 8 feet wide by 120 feet long. Q29.  How should the dock sections be anchored together? A29.  Accessories to attach will be purchased through a future solicitation. Q30.  In a river environment given the current and number of boats I would recommend stainless steel or rubber. A30.  The end outcome is there is going to be another dock project coming up to purchase and install this dock as well as two other docks in our canal and river. We are hoping that if for some reason a piece is broken or we wanted down the line to reconfigure the docks these docks are interchangeable for that to happen.

<p><br />FBO Classification:  R499<br />NAICS:  711510</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for federal buildings nationwide.</p>
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a federal art commission in conjunction with the new construction of U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>This project provides for the construction of a new courthouse in downtown Los Angeles, CA. The site/design and construction prospectus will be designed to meet the amended 30-year requirements of the U.S. District Courts and related agencies with the initial build-out to house the 10-year housing requirements.  The Project involves the design and construction of an approximately 600,000 gross square foot courthouse, including 110 controlled-access indoor parking spaces, in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>This Project is an opportunity in design and construction excellence. GSA intends to build a new United States Courthouse that shall be a focus of pride for the community it serves, as well as the nation. The Project shall be a functional, innovative, sustainable, cost-effective, state-of-the-art, court facility that will contribute to the overall design quality of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>GSA generally allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs for new or modernized federal buildings for art commissions.  The art budget for the new U.S. Courthouse project is currently estimated to be $1,500,000.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artist Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the U.S. Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on February 22, 2013. &nbsp;Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.  If any technical questions arise regarding this posting please contact Mr. William Caine, Art in Architecture Program, Office of the Chief Architect at william.caine@gsa.gov or 202.501.4271.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: the media, materials, content, style, and scope of the artist's past work, along with the artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a price proposal for the contemplated project.  GSA has determined that the combined weight of all the technical selection criteria is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the building project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

The NAICS Code is 238160 with a size standard of $14.0 million, construction, roof repairs. This requirement is 100% set aside for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.
This acquisition is solicited pursuant to Public Law 109-461, 38 USC section 8127, as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside.

Bids over $100,000 must include a bid bond.

Successful offeror(s) will be required to be actively registered in System for Award Management (SAM), upon submission of proposal. Due to the urgent need of roof repairs, if vendors are not active in SAM, this could be a reason for non-responsiveness.

SCOPE OF WORK

The St. Petersburg Regional Office's current roof is in a deteriorating condition.  The area of concern is the roof area around the skylight, and the numerous equipment penetrations through the roof.  Correction is needed of the negative roof deck slope that directs water towards the base of the skylight. Per current recommendations of the National Roofing Contractors Association, standing seam metal roofs should have a minimum positive drainage slope of " per foot of run. Upon review of the original building plans and details, a positive drainage slope of minimum " per foot of run was indicated for the metal roof deck. While on six of the eight skylight sides the roof does appear to have a positive drainage slope away to the building perimeter, the two problematic areas do not. The decking appears to have been subject to excessive deflection between the purlin support elements directly at the skylight perimeter, resulting in a permanent bending of the deck surface and resultant ponding of water at the skylight base. While it may be possible to reverse the deck deflection from beneath (via the interstitial space between metal deck and concrete roof deck), spray is required on polyurethane to metal decking atop the existing to provide the required positive slope.

Award will be made on the basis of the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) quote.  All quotes will be evaluated and considered for contract award.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 1: Capable of calibrate and repair all Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) in accordance with the manufacturer suggested tolerances.  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 2: Capable of testing equipment needs to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST).  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 3: Provide calibration documentation on each piece of test equipment calibrated.  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 4. System for Award Management (SAM). Have a current registration in the SAM with updated DUNS and CAGE numbers.  <br>    <br>  Subfactor 5. Government Purchase Card (GPC).  Confirm that your firm will accept the US Government Purchase Card as method of payment.  <br>    <br>  Evaluation Standards:  The Government will use the following standards to rate Technical:   <br>  (1) Acceptable - Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the quotation  <br>  (2)  Unacceptable - Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the quotation    <br>    <br>  FACTOR 2: PRICE. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on anticipated adequate price competition.  Price will not be rated. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes only by adding the total price for all option years to the total price for the base year.  Once the technical subfactors are rated as acceptable, award will be made to the technically acceptable quoter with the lowest price.  <br>    <br>  The Government intends to make an award without conducting discussions.  After the initial evaluation of quotations is completed, if one or more quotations are rated Acceptable for Technical Acceptance, the initial evaluation will become the final evaluation of quotations and award will be made without discussions to the lowest priced quoter.  If any technical subfactor is rated Unacceptable after the initial evaluation, the technical factor will be rated Unacceptable and the quotation will no longer be considered for award.  If all quotations submitted result in an unacceptable technical evaluation then clarifications may be necessary.  The Government evaluation team will evaluate the quoter's response to the Government exchanges with quoters.  <br>    <br>  (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in blanket purchase agreement without further action by either party. Before quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <br>    <br>   (End of provision)  <br>  	  <br>  		  <br>  		  <br>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xviii) 52.247-34 F.o.b.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RFI DEADLINE EXTENSION</strong><br /></span><br /><strong>The RFI response deadline is being extended in order to allow the&nbsp;Government time to respond to questions submitted. There will be an additional seven (7) days also given to allow respondents adequate time to&nbsp;edit/modify their responses.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</strong><br />General Introduction:</p>
<p>1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Human Systems Division (AFLCMC/WNU) is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to respond to the requirements listed in this document. AFLCMC is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to explore cost effective options to provide this capability. This is an RFI only in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.</p>
<p>2. AFLCMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>3. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist AFLCMC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.</p>
<p>4. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.

<p>5. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation.

<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>Gather information from industry to gauge the market place, state of technology, and availability of a Noninvasive Patient Warming and Cooling Device (NIPWC).

<p>NIPWC Requirements:</p>
<p>The requirements are outlined in Attachment 1 to this RFI. This document should be completed to show the Government which specifications can and cannot be met.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Responses from U.S. and non-U.S. firms will be accepted to this NIPWC RFI.

Post submittal, one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated; however, they may be offered to responders to clarify the government's understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach.

<DESC><p>*************************************************************************<br />7/6/2012 - Modification I<br />Please see the below for an updated clarification of requirements for 1662121964 - Cyber Career Path Program.&nbsp; For clarification, it was not the intention to state that The SANS Institute provided, or the FBI required&nbsp;both a certification and courses to be supplied through the same vendor.&nbsp; Rather, it is acceptable for the course provider to supply a personnel certification, which is ANSI accredited, through a certifying body.&nbsp; Additionally, it is not required that each individual course be ANSI accredited.&nbsp; Rather, it is only required that an ANSI accredited personnel certification body provide an ANSI accredited certification.&nbsp; It is, however, still required that one vendor be capable of providing all 38 courses, available througout the CONUS, and to provide an agreement with an ANSI accredited personnel certification body to provide an ANSI accredited certification.&nbsp; <br />**************************************************************************<br /><br />PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies, Inc d/b/a The SANS Institute, 8120 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 205 Bethesda, MD 20814 (herein after known as "The SANS Institute") for a Cyber Career Path Program consisting of 38 courses. Additionally, The SANS Institute will provide an agreement with an American National Standards Institute personnel certification body which provides ANSI Accredited Certification in information security. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 541519; Other Computer Related Services.</p>
<p>The Cyber Career Path Program (CCPP) is in response to a greater need within the FBI for Cyber investigators with accredited training. The CCPP will support the ever growing need to combat cyber based threats. The curriculum is specifically aimed at Cyber investigators which consist of FBI cyber agents, task force personnel and other FBI employees. The curriculum will consist of 38 courses as attached. The FBI requires that the program offer an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited certification. ANSI provides the International Standard ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation program for personnel certification agencies. The process used by ANSI to accredit certification bodies is based on an international standard (ISO/IEC 17011). Adherence to a rigorous internationally recognized accreditation process ensures that the ANSI process conforms to the highest accreditation standard and represents the best practices in certification. An ANSI accredited certification is required to ensure Cyber investigators are trained in the most up to date, highest caliber methods and practices to combat cyber threats.</p>
<p>The FBI's requirements are (1) provide all thirty eight courses as attached (not necessarily in name but in subject matter), (2) and an agreement with an ANSI-Accredited personnel certification body to supply the cyber career path program with an ANSI Accredited certification (3) at locations throughout the CONUS. The courses requested must be Commercially-available Off The Shelf (COTS) in accordance with Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Therefore, the vendor should not proffer courses which are "developmental" or in any way not available at the date of award. The FBI does not require the provider to provide these courses solely to the FBI or at an FBI facility, rather it is acceptable to provide seats on an enrollment basis. Based on market research conducted, the previous year's competition returning only one responsible and a sources sought notice released for a two week period, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by The SANS Institute, as no other vendor is capable of providing the Cyber Career Path Program with an ANSI Accredited certification to meet the FBI's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 4:00 pm, EST, by July 12, 2012, by email to the attention of Todd M. Townsend, Contract Specialist, at todd.townsend@ic.fbi.gov with the subject line: "CCPP Capabilities Statement." Conforming information received will be considered by the technical team, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Should the Government receive one or more viable quotes, this RFQ will subject to a directed competition between The SANS Institute and the capable vendor(s). Should the Government receive no viable quote(s), the award will be made solely to The SANS Institute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The awardee shall be registered in the Central Contractor's Database (CCR) and also the Online Representations and Certification (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; or veteran owned small business; women-owned small business; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Neuroscience Research Branch (MCGNRB) is to support fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying and influencing brain development, neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, signal transduction pathways, and the biochemical and behavioral actions of therapeutic agents in animals and humans. The goals of the MCGNRB include the identification of novel targets (genes or molecules) for therapeutic intervention, characterization of the neurobiological behavioral actions of psychoactive agents, and design and development of novel ligands for functional brain imaging in humans, psychoactive agents for basic and clinical research, and potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of mental disorders.</p>
<p>To further these goals, a contract for the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) was initiated to provide broad-based screening capabilities, in the form of pharmacological and functional assays, and receptor binding data (Ki values) to the scientific research community with the intent of stimulating innovative research and development efforts in the design and development of novel psychoactive compounds for preclinical research, neuroimaging, and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The program focuses on the use of state-of-the-art, high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds in human and rodent CNS receptor binding and functional assays.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives. <br />The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all small businesses capable of providing screening and testing services to continue a project entitled, " NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program". This project was first initiated in 1992. The purpose of this initiative is to continue services to (1) establish and validate assays for cloned human or rodent receptors by cloning a receptor, maintaining a stably transfected cell line expressing the receptor, and establishing the binding and functional assays for the receptor in accordance with standards established in the published scientific literature; (2) conduct high-throughput screening of compounds in broad-based primary and secondary pharmacological assays (radioligand binding and enzyme assays), functional assays, high-throughput patch clamp electrophysiology assays, and assays to assess brain penetrance, potential bioavailability, and cardiac toxicity (Note - the screening services are intended primarily as a screen for compounds that have previously been shown to possess pharmacological, biochemical, or behavioral activities relevant to NIMH, rather than for the purpose of large-scale, random screening of natural products or combinatorial libraries) (3) provide an electronic data file of screening results for each compound suitable for inclusion in a scientific publication; and (4) update and maintain a Ki database for compounds and drugs.</p>
<p>Project requirements:</p>
<p>The PDSP was developed to provide screening of novel synthetic compounds and natural products for potential use as research tools or probes for basic and clinical research, as therapeutic agents for mental disorders, and as PET, SPECT, and fMRI ligands for functional brain imaging.</p>
<p>Interested small businesses should demonstrate they currently have the necessary expertise and capability to receive and test up to 3,000 individual samples per year and up to 5,000 plated samples (synthetic compounds, small molecules, gene products, and natural product extracts) per year, in a wide variety of human and rodent CNS receptor and enzyme screening assays and functional assays, and to provide an electronic data file for each of the screened compounds. A list of targets of interest to NIMH can be found at http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdspw/clones.php. Samples for screening can include, but are not limited to, novel chemical entities, structural analogs of lead compounds, genes or gene products, small molecules, enzyme inhibitors, and natural products.</p>
<p>Based on historical data, a projected annual assay workload could be up to: 1) 20,000 primary pharmacological assays; 5,000 secondary pharmacological assays; 100,000 functional assays; 1300 brain penetrance, bioavailability, or toxicity assays; and 5-10 new assays developed and validated. These are estimates, which can fluctuate on a yearly basis. Small businesses should demonstrate they can provide these services up to the stated quantities. Since these are estimates, capacities above the estimated assay workload are considered preferable.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance:<br />The estimated period of performance is June 30, 2013 - June 29, 2018<br />Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>The contractor shall use Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) to conduct all aspects of the contract.</p>
<p>Capability statement/information sought:</p>
<p>Any small business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a narrative response indicating previous experience and capabilities related to this work.</p>
<p>Capability Statements should clearly state/describe your ability to carry out the services above, including:</p>
<p>1) information regarding your (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) organizational&nbsp;experience and qualifications to perform this work, including the laboratory capacity to meet or exceed the estimated workload<br />2) respondent's DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUB Zone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code; (note: the applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541711, 500 employees); <br />4) information on the management structure and history of your organization, and <br />5) Any other resources available to perform this work.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to limit your response to fewer than 10 pages and must specifically address each of the requirement specific items requested.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should be received no later than the posted due date, and can be sent either by mail or e-mail (csager@mail.nih.gov) to the point of contact listed. If using the U.S. Postal Service or commercial overnight services, please send an original plus five (5) copies of your response. Note: for commercial overnight services, use the Rockville, MD. 20852 address.</p>

<a href="mailto:Martiyan.Stefan@epa.gov">Martiyan.Stefan@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source synopsized below on 25 January 2013.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), on behalf of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), intends to negotiate another follow-on extension of services on a firm-fixed price, sole source basis.  A modification to extend support services to MacFadden & Associates, Inc. (MacFadden) of 8403 Colesville Road, Ste 400, Silver Spring, MD 20910-4032, performed under task order number EP08H002296 and issued against MacFadden's General Services Administration schedule contract number GS-35F-4713G, will be processed under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A) and (C).  The sole source extension is in the interest of economy and efficiency, and the new work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order given that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source o r limited-sources procedures.  Additionally, an urgent and compelling need exists as following the standard competitive Federal Supply Schedule procedures would cause unacceptable delays in the EPA's ability to meet the accelerated registration requirements mandated by Congress under the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act (PRIA).
The referenced contract task order was originally scheduled to expire on 31 August 2012.  The task order was first modified to extend the performance period to 31 October 2012 in accordance with the Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source synopsis posted on 25 July 2012 and as provided below.  The order was again modified to extend the performance period to 31 January 2013 in accordance with the Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source synopsis posted on 17 October 2012 and as provided below.  A new contract task order is expected to be awarded by the current expiration date of 31 January 2013, but the order will not be made effective until 15 February 2013.  The new contractor will need to be given Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) clearance prior to performing work under the task order.  This process is expected to take up to two (2) weeks.  Additionally, a gap in service under the referenced contract task order is unacceptable to the EPA.  The sole  source award will help to continue the ongoing regular operation of the Document and Data Management Support (DDMS) operations and to ensure that costs, resources, and activities are managed appropriately.  In order to avoid a gap in service, EPA intends to award a two (2) week extension of the current contract task order until a competitive contract can be awarded and made effective by 15 February 2013.
The modification is for non-personal services to be extended on MacFadden's referenced contract task order.  The task order was awarded competitively on 1 September 2008.  The modification to extend services for the additional two (2) week period is valued at $84,677.58. The same level of services will be provided by MacFadden in accordance with the contract task order Performance Work Statement.  Under the current task order, MacFadden provides services to the OPP, including extraction of information about pesticide studies, analyses of the records resulting from the decision processes, and the capture of data supporting regulatory applications.  MacFadden has the experience to address the follow-on requirement to meet the PRIA mandated accelerated regulatory schedule and the necessary expertise and knowledge of the pesticide label process.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT TASK ORDER.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THE TWO (2) WEEK FOLLOW-ON EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely in the discretion of the EPA.  The EPA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the EPA to award the two (2) week follow-on extension of services, sole source modification to the subject contract task order.
Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 30 January 2013 by 10:00 AM ET to Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer, via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  A draft Performance Work Statement is provided at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/pcsc/DDMSLUIS/index.htm.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that competition of the two (2) week extension of services would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder EPA mission objectives.

Under the current task order, MacFadden provides services to the OPP, including extraction of information about pesticide studies, analyses of the records resulting from the decision processes, and the capture of data supporting regulatory applications.  MacFadden has the experience to address the follow-on requirement to meet the PRIA mandated accelerated regulatory schedule and the necessary expertise and knowledge of the pesticide label process.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE MODIFICATION FOR FOLLOW-ON WORK UNDER THE REFERENCED CONTRACT TASK ORDER.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THE TWO (2) MONTH FOLLOW-ON EXTENSION WILL BE PROVIDED.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely in the discretion of the EPA.  The EPA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the EPA to award the two (2) month follow-on extension of services, sole source modification to the subject contract task order.
Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than 14 August 2012 by 2:00 PM ET to Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer, via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  A draft Performance Work Statement is provided at http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/pcsc/DDMSLUIS/index.htm.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that competition of the two (2) month extension of services would be advantageous to the Government and would not hinder EPA mission objectives.
END of Notice.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following contractor's questions.&nbsp; The response time remains January 31, 2013 at 3:30 p.m. (EST).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />1. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: Is a forklift available as support for unloading and unpacking the tooling and equipment? <br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: No, the contractor is required to provide all equipment, materials and supplies for the requested services.<br />2. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: What is the weight capacity of the forklift?<br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: Please see the Government's response to Question # 1. <br />3. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: Is it acceptable to remove the Cobalt 60 source rod assembly and send it to our hot cell for source replacement? This is our preferred operation as then we know that all of the moving components are the same and there will be no operational issues with the new source. This will require a ~ one week down time in which the new attenuator system shall be fitted onto the unit.<br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: Yes, the irradiator may be taken off-site as long as the contractor's license permits. Our license does not permit us to remove or use the source off-site. All transportation must comply with the Department of Transportation's regulations. <br />4. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: The new source capsule will require a radioactive materials license amendment as with the Model 109-85 reload which was just completed. Is this an issue?<br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: The AFRRI-02 (Materials) License is only authorized a sealed source, 120 curies per source and 120 curies total. Any other source encapsulations will not be acceptable. The current license will not be amended for any other source. <br />Please note that the cobalt source and attenuator is a Category II irradiator not a Category I irradiator. The license of any service provider and/or manufacturer must contain authorization by the license issuer (NRC or Agreement State) to provide preventive maintenance and other services on Category II irradiators. <br />5. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: What is the physical space available to perform this work?<br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: The dimensions of the low-level cobalt irradiation room are approximately 40 ft. x 33 ft. with a 16 ft. ceiling. The entry door is approximately 9 ft. x 9 ft.<br /><br />6. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: Is welding allowed at the facility? If not, then we may need to remove the Model 81 system when it is EMPTY and take it off site for attaching the attenuator bracket. Is this acceptable? <br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: Yes, the contractor must obtain all permits and or license or any other documentation before work commences.</p>
<p>7. CONTRACTOR'S QUESTION: Is it necessary to refurbish the model 81 system operating system during this project?<br />GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE: No, it isn't necessary to refurbish the model 81 system.</p>

<DESC>Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the  quote mark One Door to the Corps quote mark  via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br>  <br> WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE UNDER CURRENT RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0011  <br>    <br>  Pre-solicitation Notice   Unrestricted Request for Proposal (RFP) for  Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of  Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.  <br>    <br>  The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Mr. Andrew Nelson at 817-886-1055, e-mail andrew.j.nelson2@usace.army.mil.  <br>    <br>  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

<DESC>VISN 5 VA DC 
STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  GENERAL:  This is a non-personal services requirement to provide (a) data analysis and (b) improvement facilitation. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.  Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. 

1.1  Description of Services/Introduction:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and  other items and non-personal services necessary to perform  data analysis and improvement facilitation as defined in this Performance Work Statement  except for those items specified as government furnished property and services.  The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract.

1.2 Background:  This request is based on a System Redesign project funded in 2010 and titled "Enhancing the center and culture for performance excellence at the Washington, DC VAMC".    Most of the tasks in this funding initiative have been completed in 2011.  The remaining tasks are the focus on this contract.  

The Washington, DC VA Medical Center (DCVAMC) is committed to being the "Flagship of VA Healthcare."  As the flagship, the medical center is a model site for innovation, continuous quality improvement, and patient safety.  DCVAMC has a systematic approach to improving performance.  Senior leaders regularly review a comprehensive set of performance measures.  In addition to regular Baldridge assessments, a Performance Measure Matrix (PMM) is used to measure and report our ongoing performance of critical processes leading to organizational success.  This also monitors comparisons to VA and non-VA hospitals to monitor targets set by VHA, VISN5 and the facility.  We use these reviews and third party assessments to identify opportunities for improvement.  

The DCVAMC Leadership Team guides the organization, plans for long-term sustainability, ensures effective self-governance, reviews performance, and creates a nurturing culture for operational excellence through the DCVAMC leadership system.  This system focuses on balancing the needs of all stakeholders and establishes the foundation for overall leadership excellence in setting and deploying DCVAMC mission, vision, and values.  Senior leaders serve as strong role models as they implement the leadership system to set organization-wide direction in accordance with the vision, mission and values.

Performance and quality improvement initiatives have been a major focus at the DCVAMC.  Different models of improvement have been tried.  DCVAMC will focus on the Lean model.  The current infrastructure does not fully promulgate effective execution of performance or change activities, resulting in inefficiency of process, delays in organizational learning, and waste of resources.  Although there is currently a Center for Performance Management that exists at the DCVAMC, its ability to enhance organizational performance and promote innovation or creativity is limited due to the lack of availability of dedicated personnel to Lean initiatives and expertise in analysis of large data driven from CPRS.  

As a part of the Patient Flow Collaborative, the DCVAMC was offered the option to participate in the second phase of the Bed Management System (BMS) roll out.  We are currently in the process of planning for the implementation of this new software.  The successful implementation of this software necessitates the redesign of the way we currently coordinate inpatient flow activities.  This is the second area of focus in our proposal.  By developing an Inpatient Center to focus on these activities, the DCVAMC will continue to improve on delivering patient-centered care by focusing on streamlining the admissions through discharge process to serve our Veteran patients better.  

The current VISN 5 network's enabling strategic goal is to deliver world-class service to veterans and their families by applying sound business principles that result in effective management of people, communications, technology, and governance.  This contract for improvement through system redesign and Lean projects will help our facility achieve this strategic goal.  This will be exemplified with the successful implementation of our proposed redesign project.  

1.3 Objectives: The overall strategic plan for further enhancing DCVAMC's commitment to innovative performance improvement activities is divided into two areas:  1) support for enhancing our current Center for Performance Management through analysis of data from CPRS and from Veteran Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI), 2) the facilitation of Lean projects to improve care using data available through previous step.

1.4 Scope:  The contractor shall provide two services:  data analysis and improvement facilitation.  These services are described in the following:

"	Data analysis.  The data analysis shall rely on data mining techniques and artificial intelligence for analysis of large massive databases, including text analysis.  The expected number of unique patients to be analyzed is 600,000 cases.  For each patient, 5 years of CPRS data are available.  In addition, many data items, including simple items such as weight are text fields that require complex artificial intelligence techniques for analysis of the data.  In particular, the contractor shall use Guided Bayesian approach described in previous collaboration as their method of analysis.  In conducting these analysis, the contractor shall rely on remote access to the data servers within VA and shall not transfer the data outside of the VA facilities.  This effort will have the following components:
o	Classification of text in Hospice Consults notes within CPRS for patients in DC VA
o	Examination of methods of measuring severity of illness based on claims data and laboratory findings.  
o	Examination of reason for readmission within 30 days.  
o	Examination of trajectory to death for severely ill patients
o	Examination of clinical visits that could have been avoided through telemedicine or other remote contacts
"	Facilitation of Improvement Efforts.  The contract shall use the data analysis accomplished to implement Lean projects within VADCMC.  At a minimum the following efforts will be undertaken:
o	Description of the extent of the problem using patient outcomes.
o	Training of clinicians/managers within VA in Lean improvement efforts.
o	Facilitation of at least 4 Lean improvement projects that examine a clinical decision and design new care protocols that avoid wasted effort and improve patient outcomes.

1.5	Period of Performance:  The period of performance shall be for one year.  
 
1.6 General Information

1.6.1 Quality Control:  The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure services are performed in accordance with this PWS.  The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services.  The contractor's quality control program is the means by which he assures himself that his work complies with the requirement of the contract.  Within 30 days after contract award, three copies of a comprehensive written QCP shall be submitted to the KO and COR, within 5 working days when changes are made thereafter.  After acceptance of the quality control plan the contractor shall receive the contracting officer's acceptance in writing of any proposed change to his QC system.  

1.6.2 Quality Assurance:  The government shall evaluate the contractor's performance under this contract in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan.  This plan is primarily focused on what the Government must do to ensure that the contractor has performed in accordance with the performance standards.  It defines how the performance standards will be applied, the frequency of surveillance, and the minimum acceptable defect rate(s).    The government's evaluation is focused on deliverable milestones.

3.5  Materials:  The Government will provide Standard Operating Procedures and Policies. 
 
4.  CONTRACTOR FURNISHED ITEMS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  

4.1  General:  The Contractor shall furnish all supplies, equipment, facilities and services required to perform work under this contract that are not listed under Section 3 of this PWS.   

5.  Specific Tasks: 

5.1.  Basic Services.  

5.1.1.  Data analysis.  The data analysis shall rely on data mining techniques and artificial intelligence for analysis of large massive databases, including text analysis.  The expected number of unique patients to be analyzed is 600,000 cases.  For each patient, 5 years of CPRS data are available.  In addition, many data items, including simple items such as weight are text fields that require complex artificial intelligence techniques for analysis of the data.  In particular, the contractor shall use Guided Bayesian approach described in previous collaboration as their method of analysis.  In conducting these analysis, the contractor shall rely on remote access to the data servers within VA and shall not transfer the data outside of the VA facilities.  This effort will have the following components:
"	Classification of text in Hospice Consults notes within CPRS for patients in DC VA.  The analysis should describe the nature of consults, the recommended decision, the percentage of times the patient followed the consult, the frequency with which hospice patients were readmitted to the hospital and the factors that increase the need for hospice consults.
"	Examination of methods of measuring severity of illness based on claims data and laboratory findings.  The effort should statistically compare the performance of established laboratory based key clinical findings to claims based severity/prognostic indicators.  
"	Examination of reason for readmission within 30 days.  The effort should analyze the factors that contribute to readmission and assess the probability of readmission at discharge. The effort should lead to design of an alert system within CPRS to inform discharge planners of unusual discharge requirements to prevent readmissions.    
"	Examination of trajectory to death for severely ill patients.  The project should examine 12 months prior to death and classify patients in groups that have distinct trajectory to death.
"	Examination of clinical visits that could have been avoided through telemedicine or other remote contacts.  The project shall identify factors that could lead to increased access to appointments for primary or specialist care patients.

5.1.2.  Facilitation of Improvement Efforts.  The contract shall use the data analysis accomplished to implement Lean projects within VADCMC.  At a minimum the following efforts will be undertaken:
"	Description of the extent of the problem using patient outcomes. The project shall rely on VA employee's description of problems and confirm these problems through analysis of CPRS data.
"	Training of clinicians/managers within VA in Lean improvement efforts.  The project shall provide clinicians/managers with continuing education or university credits.  It shall assist participating clinicians/managers in understanding how to proceed with Lean projects.
"	Facilitation of at least 4 Lean improvement projects that examine a clinical decision and design new care protocols that avoid wasted effort and improve patient outcomes.  For each project, the facilitator shall meet with VA employees individually before group meeting and as a group during scheduled times to solicit their suggestions for change.  The procedures to follow should include Lean procedures.

5.1.3. Preparation of manuscripts.  The contractor shall conduct literature review and prepare the following manuscripts:
1.	Paper on use of Hospice in VA
2.	Paper on accuracy of methods for predicting patient's prognosis
3.	Paper on reasons for readmission within 30 days for one index disease
4.	Paper on trajectory of illness for one group of patients
5.	Paper on clinical Lean procedures with examples from lessons learned at VA

6.  APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS (CURRENT EDITIONS) 

6.1. The Contractor must abide by all applicable regulations, publications, manuals, and local policies and procedures.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action:  This proposed action is for a 12-month Firm-Fixed-Price Delivery Order (DO) to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), to upgrade existing suites of brand name Autodesk software from 2012 to 2013 versions and to renew maintenance support for facilities in the VA Region 3 Office of Information and Technology (OIT). 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  Autodesk design and creation suites provide VA facility engineers with the platform necessary for creating and editing engineering designs, construction plans, installation of real property and facility record drawings.  The current support for the VA owned software expires on January 30, 2013, and as such, the period of performance required for the maintenance support and upgrades under this effort is January 31, 2013 through January 30, 2014.  REDACTED
                     
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:   Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph eight of this document, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the aforementioned brand name software upgrades and support.  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  The Autodesk support coverage from Autodesk, or an authorized reseller, will provide product support and new version updates to existing software.  Only Autodesk, or an authorized reseller, has the proprietary rights to provide the required support for this software.  The proprietary data allows only Autodesk, or an authorized reseller, to provide required patch fixes and updates which are critical to the continued functionality of the software and in turn the task completion the software facilitates.  Autodesk products allow VA staff engineers to manage land, physical assets, infrastructure and facilities with greater efficiency from a single software platform.  Additionally, the use of differing vendor products would severely hamper existing capabilities and require extensive re-tooling of workflow processes.  Published training documents and on-the-job training tutorials would have to be re-worked which would take an extensive amount of time, resources, and funds to accomplish.   

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  Limited competition is anticipated for the required brand name upgrades and support.  

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a brand name, there are multiple authorized resellers of the brand name supplies on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(6), this effort is exempt from synopsizing since the proposed contract action is an order placed under an existing Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract.  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be fully competed.

8.  Market Research:  REDACTED

9.  Other Facts: N/A
