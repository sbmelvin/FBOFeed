<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services from Texas Tech University on a sole source basis.

Period of Performance: September 1, 2007 - August 31, 2007

Proposed Work
Professional services are required over a 12-month period to develop algorithms for (1) high-fidelity and high-performance compression and decompression of biomedical images that are compatible with emerging standards for Web imaging and for (2) Content-Based Image Retrieval of digitized uterine cervix images. The capabilities created in (1) are expected to be used for abroad range of applications and image types for public image delivery by NLM. The capabilities created in (2) are expected to provide significant advances to NLM R&D systems for the retrieval of uterine cervix images containing pathological tissue regions of importance to oncologist researchers.

For (1) the compression/decompression algorithms shall build upon the previously-developed NLM algorithm and implementation, ?TTC v5.0?, which is based upon the Hybrid Vector-Scalar Quantization/Backward-Coded Wavelet Transform (HVSQ/BCWT) compression/decompression method. The required work shall (a) incorporate a new scheme of memory management for the Discrete Wavele Transform (DWT) in order to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in memory usage in the overall compression process; (b) build upon the experimental TTC v5.0 region-of-interest (ROI) compression and decompression capability to provide robust retrieval of compressed data specified by ROI both in the local and clien/server modes; and to provide specific capabilities that exploit the use of ROI compression/decompression for the panning and zooming of large images; ?) structure the algorihms and implementations compatility wih the Internet Imaging Protocol (IIP), in order to achieve usability through an emerging standard for Web imaging; and (d) conduct preliminary studies on ?transcoding? between TTC and JPEG2000, so that, for example, a user having only a JPEG2000 decoder would be able to decode and use the TTC-compressed images. All work for (1) shall build upon and preserve the three-tier modualr structure of TTC v5.0.  

For (2) the algorithms developed shall include two categories, as follows: (a) algorithms to extend work in texture characterization of the uterine cervix images, which shall build upon previous NLM work that computes texture parameters for mosiac and punctuated regions; and (b) new algorithms to characterize tissue regions in the uterine cervix by size and relative geometric relationships. These algorithms shall be implemented to operate compabily with existing NLM CBIR programs for uterine cervix retrieval.

Please contact me via email to obtain the full statement of work.

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of  Non- Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR): http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.

Laboratories have ongoing important influenza and HIV projects whereby they are required to do a lot high throughput ELISA?s, and phage based experiments.  This exercise led to wrist and hand problems and carpal tunnel syndrome for users.  The Rainin pipettes are electronic multi-channels which are highly ergonomic and give very accurate and highly reproducible pipetting that is required for experiments.  This technology is proprietary and exclusively offered only by Rainin.

<DESC>The anticipated award date will be: 14JUN2007 Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.  Description The government intends to negotiate multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified sources in order to competitively award BPA calls for repair requirements under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) from July 2007 through June 2008.  Respondents to this synopsis will be provided a request for quotation (RFQ) for a price list to include the respondent's best price for all of the items for which they are an approved repair source.  A respondent may at anytime attempt to become a qualified repair source for an item listed below, by following the applicable procedure.  If more than one BPA is established with small business entities for an individual National Stock Number (NSN), repair requirements for that NSN will be set-aside for small business. Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA with will be negotiated with the respondent.  The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the government to issue any calls against the BPA.  The estimated total dollar amount for all calls issued in the 12 month duration of the BPA is $2.5 Million.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed the SAT ($100,000).  All interested parties should contact Douglas Hansen by phone at (801) 586-1225, or by email at douglas.hansen@hil.af.mil, or Brenda Collard at (801) 586-3358,  or brenda.collard@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis a requirement for Training Support and Implementation of Balanced Scorecard Methodology at the Joint Systems Integration Command.   The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Training Human Capital (THC), Norfolk, VA, for this requirement.  
THC has supported the development of JSIC?s Balanced Scorecard since October, 2005 and is intimately familiar with JSIC and JSIC?s Balanced Scorecard.  THC is currently engaged as USJFCOM?s trainer for strategic management and is the vendor for USJFCOM Strategic Leadership Development Program, which is strongly synergistic with JSIC?s strategic management initiatives and efforts.  THC has trained nearly 100 USJFCOM leaders in management techniques since 2004 and continues to provide management and leadership training to other USJFCOM organizations today.  THC's work with other JFCOM directorates of JFCOM is integrally related to the required support. As a result, THC is uniquely qualified to improve the quality and socialization of JSIC?s management products by engaging other USJFCOM personnel in their development and socialization.  Use of any other vendor would negate this essential socialization effect within USJFCOM.  
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 611430 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.

No other company has, collectively, developed the level of expertise or access to key individuals in the DoD community to perform the defined task. Any other company would require significantly more time (estimated at well over 50 percent) to perform this tasking due to the need to establish the contacts within the DoD and Navy that SEA L. C. already has established.  Therefore, no other company is in the position to provide the required support. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  Period of performance will be fifteen (15) months from issuance of the order. NAICS Code 541611 applies. SBA Size Standard is 6.5 million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division is releasing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit applied research and advanced technology demonstration proposals for the development and flight demonstration of an advanced Multi-Mode Sensor (MMSS) that contains an eye-safe LADAR (Laser Radar) augmented with complementary Electro-Optical (EO) and Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) sensors, suitable for VTUAV. It is anticipated that up to $15.0M over five years will be available for this solicitation, subject to approval of appropriations. The program seeks to demonstrate advanced technology for an MMSS to support Vertical Take-off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VTUAV) Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting (ISRT) missions in the littoral combat environment. The flight demonstration model should significantly improve upon current system performance suitable to a technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 within 60 months.  TRL 7 for this program is defined as a flight demonstration of the MMSS aboard a helicopter in the littoral environment.  The MMSS flight demonstration model shall be suitable for flight testing on a small helicopter to be determined and supplied by the government team at a later date. The final configuration shall be technically suitable for transition into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program acquisition phase. The MMSS system shall be defined as all the components, sub-components, and auxiliary equipment necessary to operate in accordance with specifications found in the BAA, except for electrical power equipment. The use of advanced eye safe LADAR technology is highly encouraged.  The desired technical effort should consist of conceptual, preliminary, and detailed design, fabrication, testing, and flight demonstration support. It is possible that individual offerors will not have the complete skills to successfully execute the program in its entirety. Therefore, business-to-business or business-to-academia coordination or partnerships are highly encouraged to improve analysis, design, and testing capabilities as well as pre-production design and planning. This publication is for a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, Ca, anticipates issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) supply contract to Penguin Computing, Inc., 300 California Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA  94104, on a sole source basis using FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This acquisition is to purchase computer hardware and software to upgrade an existing Penguin Cluster Computer System.  The system upgrade includes a new master node, additional compute nodes, a NFS management node, a tape backup system, an upgraded operating system (Scyld Clusterware 4.0), power supplies and conditioners, and hardware and software warranty and maintenance.  The system has an architecture that requires proprietary operating system software and Penguin Computing, Inc. is the only supplier of this software. Thus, the purchased items must be compatible with NAWCWD existing hardware architecture and system software.  Specifically, the system architecture is such that compute nodes are diskless and do not contain individual copies of the operating system but rely upon the headnode to distribute required minimal kernal at job submittal.  This architecture reduces system complexity and cost but does require a specific operating system to function.  Additionally, the complete cluster system containing pre-upgrade and post-upgrade hardware and software must be fully supported as a system with warranty and maintenance. A request for quotations will be issued using FAR Part 13.5, Test Procedures for Commercial Items.  The solicitation will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://ww.fbo.gov on or about 21 August 2007.  The Penguin computer hardware and software is to be delivered no later than 21 days from date of contract award.  The anticipated award date is on 8-31-07.  Delivery will be FOB Destination, NAWCWD, China Lake, CA.  Any company believing they can provide this upgrade may submit written responses to the Contracting Officer no later than 5 days of publication of this notice.  The submission must clearly show that the proposed upgrade meets the Governments specifications.  Respond to Helen Xiong by mail Commander, Code 210000D, NAWCWPNS, 429 E.

You are strongly encouraged to register in ORCA in responding to this solicitation. You are required to have an active registration in CCR in order to conduct business with the Federal Government.  	Proposed Issue Date:  September 5, 2007 	Title of Project:   Elwha Water Facilities  	Description:  The work of this project will include four components of the overall Elwha River Restoration Project.  The Elwha Water Facilities project is composed of the Elwha Surface Water Intake (ESWI), Elwha Water Treatment Plant (EWTP), construction access improvements, and Area Flood Protection (AFP).  These four components are all located adjacent to each other north of the Elwha Dam and south of Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe lands.  The ESWI project will include the demolition of the existing intake structure and rock weir, construction of the new facilities including: sheet pile control weir, intake structure, diversion pump structure, fish screen structure; tunnel repair; piping; electrical; mechanical; utilities and site work.  The site is located adjacent to the Elwha River, with a significant amount of work being done within the river channel.  Construction of temporary diversion dams and de-watering will be part of the work.  The work within the river channel and floodplain will be seasonal because of seasonally high river flows. The Elwha Water Treatment Plant (EWTP) is located immediately downstream from ESWI and adjacent to the existing Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife  (WDFW) Fish Rearing Channel.  It is designed to treat water from the ESWI for use in industrial, municipal, and fisheries applications by removing suspended sediments.  The Contractor will perform plant start-up and be responsible for demonstrating operations in compliance with National Park Service requirements.  Construction Access Improvements includes raising and improving the Crown 'Z' Water Road, an existing county road.  The current road is considered unstable for construction use and will be raised in elevation to incorporate the new area flood protection levee.  Other improvements will include either stabilizing Upper Crown 'Z' Road, or developing construction access along the Milwaukee Grade, an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The levee construction will extend north along the Crown Z Water Road, and west of the EWTP area.  The levee's construction is required to provide 100-year flood protection for new federally funded facilities, as well as maintaining existing levels of protection for existing non-federal facilities (WDFW Fish Rearing Channel, City of Port Angeles' Ranney Well and industrial supply channel, and a future Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe hatchery pipeline). 	A pre-proposal meeting is planned in Port Angeles, Washington the third week in September, 2007.  Specific date will be published when it becomes available. 	Type of Procurement: A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price. 	Estimated price range, $60 million to $80 million. 	Time for completion, 1062 calendar days.  	Proposal receipt date is approximate; actual date will be established at the time proposal documents are available. 	All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  	It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.  	In order to be considered for award, all large businesses will be required to submit an acceptable Small, HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their proposal.   The NPS subcontracting goals for Fiscal Year 2007 for the participation of small businesses at a minimum are as follows:  Small Business Concerns - 19%; Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns - 3%; Small Women-Owned Business Concerns - 5%; HUBZone Small Business Concerns - 3%; Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns - 3%; Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concerns - 3%; 8(a) concerns - 2.5%.  	Small Disadvantaged Business & HUBZone firms must be certified in accordance with solicitation clauses 52.219-8 -- Utilization of Small Business Concerns (May 2004) & 52.219-9 -- Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Jul 2005) (status of firms can be found on CCR's Dynamic SB Search).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Ceramics Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Pfeiffer Vacuum, Inc. of Nashua, NH for two Economy Pumping Stations.

These pumping stations are widely used at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS, located off site, Upton, NY) where NIST operates 3 x-ray beamlines along with many other outside research laboratories.  

These stand alone pumping stations are unique in that they are assembled from independent functional modules, responsible for pumping, pressure sensing, power supply, etc. into a single compact unit. NIST requires the compactness of the design of the Pfeiffer pumping station due to the limited real-estate in our experimental facility. 

It is critical to the research to have 100% compatibility and interchangeability with the existing Pfeiffer Vacuum pumping stations already located at the NSLS. Without these we would not be allowed to operate in our 24/7 mode and we would incur significant downtime and additional expenses should either of the units malfunction.

No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by August 31, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with BBS Technologies, Inc./ Point Secure on a Sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) only one responsible source.

The acquisition is to establish a purchase order for a  Software License to Point Audit, and, twelve (12) months of maintenance, for PointSecure specializing in developing audit and security management software PointAuit on OpenVMS platform and is a Strategic Partner of the OpenVMS system vendor, HP.  The PointAudit tool is non-invasive and provides users with the ability to quickly and easily identify and report on vulnerabilities using industry best practices endorsed by HP.  
PointSecure?s PointAudit software allows users to quickly and easily assess the security of their OpenVMS environment from a PC console, without having to install any software on the OpenVMS host machine.  By looking at file security, system settings and user profiles, PointAudit enables users to determine if their OpenVMS security settings are set correctly and whether or not security policies are being enforced.
PointAudit is comprised of the following functional modules:

Configuration Manager is used to configure and administer security preferences, schedule and perform security tests, process and view security reports as well as administer users and servers.

Audit Manager is used to performing security tests, process and view security reports, as well as make modifications to accounts, identifiers and file settings.

Database Manager enables functionality for comparing multiple database files to baseline settings or comparing database files from different points in time to pinpoint differences.

All of these modules are requirements derived from the NIST 800-53A controls which need to be verified on a monthly basis.  The software license covers all of these features of the software.  It is a FISMA/DOC requirement to scan and continuously monitor all pieces of the Enterprise for vulnerabilities, this product will allow us to accomplish this task.  This is the only product that we have found to meet the NIST requirements, OSO has been researching products for the last two years and this deficiency was reflected in the POES and GOES POA&M's.

BBS Technologies, Inc./PointSecure is uniquely qualified to provide the PointAudit Software License and Maintenance Support, outlined in the requirement. BBS Technologies, Inc./PointSecure is the only contractor that supports OpenVMS software platform services. This Software License and Maintenance Support for PointAudit on OpenVMS platform s required by NOAA/NESDIS/NSOF. 

Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis. (Note 22 applies with a 15-day posting)

<DESC>The Brookhaven National Laboratory, (herein known as "Brookhaven") operated by Brookhaven Science Associates, Inc., under Contract DE-AC02-76CH00016, with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the operation of Brookhaven National Laboratory, herewith solicits your competitive technical and price proposals to provide the services as delineated below:

1.	INTRODUCTION
 A Memorandum of Understanding pursuant to the Economy Act through which the National Institute of Standards and Technology U.S. Department of Commerce is purchasing services from the Department of Energy (DOE)  Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is in effect for the services required herein.

	Brookhaven, is seeking a Contractor to provide professional consultative assistance and  support services on issues related to the operation, licensing, and improvement of the National Institute of Standard Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research.  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

			a) Support the license renewal of the NIST research reactor (NBSR)	
			b) Support the development of a new cold neutron source at the NBSR.
			c) Support the conversion of the NBSR from Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) to low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.	
			d) Support the design of neutron scattering equipment.	


	It is Brookhaven's intent to award one consultant contract.   A firm may respond to this RFP by submitting a technical proposal showing experience, past performance/competency and capability for all of the aforementioned areas and a price proposal.  As stated in Paragraph 5.0, Evaluation Methodology and Criteria, Proposals that do not sufficiently address all evaluation criteria will not be evaluated. 



	It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be effective on or about September 1, 2007 for a one year term with an option to extend for up to four (4) additional years.  If all options are exercised, the total term of the resultant contract will be 5 years. 

	2.   SCOPE OF WORK

	The successful offeror will need to be familiar and competent with the requirements to perform all consultative services tasks stated herein. The successful offeror(s) must be capable of providing high quality, multidisciplinary talent and staff experienced with operation and use of research or test nuclear reactors.  

	Specific experience and expertise is required in Physics and Nuclear/Mechanical Engineering disciplines. 

	The successful offeror shall provide consultative support in all of the tasks/technical areas described below.  

	2.1	Task 1:  Support for the license renewal of the NIST research reactor (NBSR):  This requires familiarity with heavy water reactor safety and operational issues, detailed knowledge of the regulatory process for licensing, and familiarity with neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and radiological analysis.

	2.2	Task 2:  Support for the development of a new cold neutron source (CNS) at the NBSR. The contractor must have knowledge, skills and abilities sufficient to design and then help supervise the installation and testing of a liquid hydrogen CNS for one of the beam tubes.  The contractor must be able to develop a safety basis for the cold source which is adequate for all regulatory approvals and must be able to specify and supervise any prototype testing.  Demonstrated experience in the design, construction and operation of liquid hydrogen cold sources in research reactors operating at above 10 MW is a prerequisite.   In addition, the contractor must have knowledge of the physical principles of cold source performance, adequate to evaluate and propose future cold sources, e.g. a large deuterium source to replace the existing source.

	2.3	Task 3:  Support for the conversion of the NBSR from HEU to LEU fuel.  This includes reviewing neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analysis of the proposed core (requires familiarity with the MCNP/MONTEBURNS and RELAP5 computer codes), designing of transition cores, and designing of flow tests that may be needed.

	2.4	Task 4:   Support for the design of neutron scattering equipment.  This requires demonstrated experience in the design of neutron scattering instruments, in the design of associated shielding, and in the design of neutron guide systems.

The Request For Proposal package is attached to this synopsis. The RFP contains the proposal content, date/time established for receipt of proposals, and submittal requirments as well as the terms and conditions for the resultant contract.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The University of Missouri Research Reactor Center, University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO 65211-3400 to obtain data on toenail trace element concentrations subjects from the FINBAR study, measuring selenium, iron, zinc, mercury, chromium, cobalt, scandium and cerium in these samples.

The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) conducts intramural research in the areas of nutrition and cancer, genetics and cancer, and cancer prevention.  The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI is currently examining the hypothesis that differences in element status are associated with the different risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The FINBAR case-control study offers a study with appropriate biological samples for the assessment of element status.  This study recruited subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett?s esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and normal subjects and collected questionnaire data and biological samples, including toenails.  Toenails can be used to determine trace element status 8 months to >1 year prior to collection and thus provide a meaningful estimate for use in epidemiologic studies.  The contractor shall measure toenail element concentrations in 655 subjects to assess the association between trace elements and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The period of performance shall be for one year from date of award.

The FINBAR study provides one of the only analytical epidemiologic studies of esophageal adenocarcinoma that collected an appropriate biological sample for the estimation of elements status, namely toenails.  These nails provide a valuable and one of the only valid methods of estimating element status prior to diagnosis in cross-sectional case-control studies.  The University of Missouri Research Reactor has provided similar services to other research groups wishing to measure nail element content in epidemiologic studies.  Using Neutron Activation Analysis, The University of Missouri can determine the concentrations of the full suite of elements from the existing toenail sample without destroying the nails.  Other methods, such as atomic absorption or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, can only measure single elements or require that the sample be destroyed.  The services provided by the Missouri Research Reactor have previously been demonstrated to provide accurate and valid measurements acceptable for publication in the peer reviewed literature

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-(b)(1) with Medical Research Council, PROMEC Unit, Fransie van Zijl Drive, Parow, Cape Town, South Africa; services to measure the levels of fumonisin B1 in 558 human nail samples.

The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) conducts intramural research in the areas of environmental exposures and cancer, genetics and cancer, and cancer prevention.  The Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) of DCEG is currently examining the hypothesis that exposure to the mycotoxin fumonsin is associated with increased risk of HCC.    

The contractor shall examine the relationship between fumonisin B1 and HCC in the high-rate area of Haimen City, China.  A prospective study of HCC has been ongoing in the area for many years.  Stored nail specimens, collected at the time of study enrollment, are available.  Approximately 500 total HCCs have developed in the cohort.  To determine whether fumonisin B1 was present in the population, 100 specimens were previously examined.  Levels of fumonisin B1 were higher in Haimen City than they were in the Linxian population in which the relationship with liver cancer was detected. HREB will provide previously collected nail samples from a prospective study of HCC in Haimen, China.  All samples will be blinded and have a pre-selected number for the order of analysis.  The period of performance shall be for one year from date of award.

The PROMEC unit of the South African Medical Research Council originally discovered the fungal toxin fumonisin B1 over 20 years ago.  They are the premier laboratory in the world for analysis of fumonisin B1.  PROMEC is the only laboratory in the world, known to HREB, to analyze human nails for fumonisin B1.  Recently the PROMEC laboratory conducted a pilot study of nail samples from the population which will be examined in the HCC study.  The pilot study reported that levels of fumonisin were detectable at high levels than they were in other areas of the world.  To maintain continuity in an on-going research project and avoid introducing new variables into the project, it is of critical importance that the procedures be conducted in the same laboratory so that there is no intra-laboratory variation or interpretation of the results. The larger, parent study, requires that data be consistent with the original purchase.

<SUBJECT>H -- Defining molecular subtypes of lymphoma for relevance to survival, etiology and diagnosis
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NCI-70132-NV
<RESPDATE>083007
<ARCHDATE>09142007
<CONTACT>Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email dm170b@nih.gov - Caren Rasmussen, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1),  with the University of  Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, 6229 Roy Carver Pavilion, Iowa City, Iowa 52242-1009; services to identify the molecular subtypes of DLBCL, CLL/SLL, and follicular lymphoma by conducting immunohistochemical staining for BCL2 for the DLBCL cases, ZAP70 for the CLL/SLL cases and CD68 and FOXP3 for the follicular lymphoma cases. 

Human lymphoid malignancies include numerous subtypes currently defined by morphologic, immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical features, with wide variability in prognosis both among and within lymphoma subtypes.  In recent years, gene expression profiling has strongly suggested that molecularly distinct disease entities with divergent clinical behavior exist within the current diagnostic categories.  Translation of these findings from the laboratory to the clinic requires a combination of development of routine assays (e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry) and large, population-based studies to establish the molecular subtypes of lymphoma with true prognostic significance.  By combining these advances in molecular pathology with population-based epidemiologic research, it will be possible to find the distinct risk factor profiles for a clinically relevant molecular subtype. 

Molecular subtypes have been identified for each of the three most common histologic types of lymphoma, which together account for approximately two-thirds of all lymphomas: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 30%), follicular lymphoma (25%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL, 12%).     The University of Iowa shall identify the molecular subtypes of DLBCL, CLL/SLL, and follicular lymphoma in the NCI-SEER study, a large, population-based case?control study recently conducted in the US, and evaluate the importance of these subtypes for prognosis and etiology.  The immunohistochemical staining for CD10, BCL-6, and MUM1 for the DLBCL have already been completed under a previous contract.  In this project the contractor shall conduct immunohistochemical staining for BCL2 for the DLBCL cases (N=273, plus 30 blinded duplicates), ZAP70 for the CLL/SLL cases (N=93, plus 20 blinded duplicates), and CD68 and FOXP3 for the follicular lymphoma cases (N=234, plus 20 blinded duplicates).  Performance period shall be for one year from date of award.  

To maintain continuity in an on-going research project and avoid introducing new variables into the project, it is of critical importance that the immunostaining procedures be conducted in the same laboratory so that there is no intra-laboratory variation in the staining of the tissue slides or interpretation of the results.  Assuring no intra-laboratory variation is essential to allow comparability of new immunostaining results to that of the previous stains and to maintain validity of the overall evaluation of all immunostaining results.   

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiment it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August __, 2007. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Procurement.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate intends to issue four (4) sole source purchase orders, within the simplified acquisition threshold, by other than Full and Open Competition, in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1, to provide DHS Transportation Security Laboratory (TSL) with Cert-Test Workstation system development, to the following vendors:

Analogic Corporation;
8 Centennial Drive;
Peabody, MA 01960.

Reveal Imaging Technologies, Incorporated;
201 Burlington Road;
Bedford, MA 01730. 

L-3 Communications Security and Detection Systems, Incorporated;
10E Commerce Way;
Woburn, MA 01801.

General Electric Company;
GE Homeland Protection, Incorporated;
7151 Gateway Boulevard;
Newark, CA 94560.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Thus, this is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP).  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the above listed vendors are the only responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Furthermore, only the above listed sources exist for each of the explosives detection system (EDS) designs that DHS S&T / Transportation Security Administration (TSA) certified.  Only the four manufacturers listed have submitted equipment that passed a certification test in response to an open solicitation published in the Federal Register Vol. 57, No. 214, Notice # 92-16, Docket 27026, Nov 4, 1992, Criteria for Certification of Explosives Detection Systems as Defined under 14 CFR 108.20 and 49 U.S.C. 44913.  Therefore, only four manufacturers possess certified EDS equipment for checked baggage that DHS S&T has laboratory-certified.  

Questions should be directed to Contract Specialist Kristian Jovanovic via e-mail:  Kristian.Jovanovic@dhs.gov and Associate Director / Contracting Officer Jamala Jones via e-mail  Jamala.Jones@dhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 P.M. EST, 23 August 2007, via email, to the above listed Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>A solicitation will be issued to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) with an as-needed mechanism to obtain various operational, technical and professional support services for a variety of tasks, studies, and projects to be performed for CDC throughout the United States. The services ordered under this contract shall service the Coordinating Office for Global Health (COGH) and other Centers, Institutes and Offices (CIOs) who need domestic services or staffing to support international activities. Services to be performed shall be non-personal and not inherently governmental services.

The following is a DRAFT Statement of Work:

                   STATEMENT OF WORK:


A.	          BACKGROUND and NEED:

CDCs mission is to promote the health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. As part of this mission, CDC is tasked with implementing programs through the Coordinating Center for Global Health (COGH) to ensure that people around the world will live safer, healthier lives through protecting Americans at home and abroad from health threats via a transnational prevention, detection and response network and establishing CDC and the United States Government as trusted and effective resources for health development around the globe. CDC addresses critical global public health challenges through working with a diverse set of partners to support the development and implementation of culturally-appropriate public health interventions.  Through our health promotion activities, both domestically and abroad, CDC contributes to reductions in global morbidity and mortality. 

 There are major programs that have been implemented globally within the last several years that have greatly expanded the global mission of the CDC and have prompted the need for increased services and staffing domestically to support those activities. As more international health crises are identified, the CDC Global Health mission and response is expanded.  The major international programs currently are the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Global Disease Detection (GDD), Pandemic and Avian Influenza Initiative, Polio Elimination worldwide, Reduction of Measles Related Mortality and Promotion of Child Health. CDC currently has about 200 staff in 45 countries around the world and those global staff are supported by the CIOs and programs here in Atlanta.  This scope of activities and CDC international support will expand as the need arises globally and this contract would cover that increased mission.

Additionally, there has been an overseas rightsizing initiative so that only those individuals who must be stationed overseas are located at international sites and much of the support is provided from Atlanta and other CDC locations domestically.  To facilitate this mission, CDC is charged with specific responsibilities which often necessitate seeking outside professional and technical expertise. The international contractor expertise by domestic staff is critical to the achievement of the overall efforts under these programs. In scaling up for the global mission, the mechanisms for hiring staff are often limiting and can take months to finalize. In addition, there are very limited mechanisms for hiring expert consultants to provide technical assistance. These impediments and delays in hiring staff hinder program development. It is therefore essential that CDC supplement its technical and professional staff through Contractor support.

B.   	 SCOPE OF WORK:

The services to be acquired under this contract provide a mechanism for various operational support and professional services tasks, studies, and projects to be performed for CDC throughout the United States. The Contractor is advised that it is not possible to determine the precise types or amounts of services, supplies and/or equipment that will be ordered during the term of the contract. The Contractor shall be o

<DESC>This procurement is changed from a competitive small business set-aside to an 8(a) competitive.  For clarification purposes, the ceiling amount of the contract is anticipated to be $35,000,000.00. 

Request for Proposal (RFP), 2006-N-09171, will be posted on-line at www.fedbizopps.gov on or before November 15, 2006.  
bligated to perform within the minimum and maximum order limitations set forth in clauses 52.216-19, Order Limitations. The time of issuance and amount of work in task orders cannot be accurately predicted. The Government will make every effort to give the Contractor advance notice of requirements, but the services for which this contract will be used could address an immediate need involving an emergency situation or short notice requirements. Services to be performed shall be non-personal and not inherently governmental services. Supplies and equipment are incidental to the required services to be performed and shall be ordered on an as needed basis on each individual task order.  Some temporary international travel may be necessary and will be detailed in each individual task order.

C.	TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor shall provide short term and long term technical support and professional services to various offices within the United States in support of the CDC as outlined in the individual task orders. The Contractor shall design, manage, and implement programs for global health activities to include HIV/AIDS, Infectious Diseases, Global Disease Detection (GDD), training of staff, population and basic education activities.  This list is not all inclusive of the activities that are supported by COGH and as CDC support of global health initiatives increase, this contract will provide support.   These individuals may be recruited from both within the Contractors organization and through its network of contacts. Category skill requirements will include professional (including medical fields,) and technical personnel.  

The professional personnel will be mid-career or senior professionals in the basic education and public health sectors as called for in the scope of work provided for each individual task order. Professional personnel will have a masters or higher level degree in fields related to public health or education or if appropriate experience that qualifies them for mid-career and senior positions, specifically with reference to those public health requirements as specified in each task order.  Professional personnel will also have 7 to 10 years of experience working in the specific or related discipline.

Direct labor categories utilized to perform the requirements of individual task orders will generally fall within the following skill requirements. A general description of each direct labor category skill requirement is as follows:

Technical  				

This category includes occupations concerned with providing technical assistance to public health, medical and scientists personnel in both laboratory and office activities. Characteristic of occupations in this category is the requirement for knowledge of scientific research techniques and analyzing data.

This category may also include occupations concerned with providing technical solutions with regards to security compliance, training, operational support, technical and development support, international or global experience and technical knowledge in a myriad of international activities. Characteristic of occupations in this category are the requirements for knowledge of information technology principles and techniques and public health program management experience that is less than full professional knowledge but which nevertheless enables the technician to understand how and why a specific device, skill or system operates.  This category may also include technical support positions for any international activities at CDC.

Professional A	 		

This category includes occupations having a recognized status based upon acquiring professional knowledge through prolonged study or experience. Examples of these professions include, but are not limited to, accountancy, public health and medical professionals. To be a professional employee, a person must not only be a professional but must be involved essentially in discharging professional duties.  

Professional B	 		

This category includes occupations having a recognized status based upon acquiring professional knowledge through the study of sciences such as biology, chemistry, physics, physiology, psychology, and medicine.  These professions perform medical, psychological, or veterinary science. Examples of these professions include, but are not limited to: pharmacists, registered nurses, physicians, hospital ancillary personnel, surgeons, research personnel, occupational healthcare providers, mental health care providers, behavior modification specialists, dentists, and veterinarians.  To be a professional employee, a person must not only be a professional but must be involved essentially in discharging professional duties.


D.	SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:

As part of providing services under this contract, the Contractor shall meet the following requirements:

1.	Management:
The Contractor shall employ management practices that ensure all requirements are fulfilled in a technically compliant and timely manner and manage services on a global basis.  This includes both day-to-day contract requirements and individual task order requirements and objectives.

2.	Recruitment and Retention:
The Contractor shall employ hiring and retention practices that ensure the Contractor is able to identify, screen, place, monitor, train, and retain qualified candidates to fulfill service requirements under this contract. The Contractor shall maintain a database of applications for appropriate candidates, accessible by education, field of expertise, work experiences, certifications, languages and other skills.

3.	Supervision:
Differing task order requirements, as well as the number and types of skills involved, will necessarily result in a variety of different approaches to supervision.  These two examples are intended to be illustrative rather than definitive when providing a wide variety of services in a number of locations: 

a.	A task order may require a number of skill categories to perform a single task (e.g., operate a small laboratory).  In this instance, it is anticipated that the senior technical skill category may assume a supervisory or lead responsibility with no increase in hourly rate.

b.	A number of task orders may require single on-site individuals.  In these instances, off-site supervision with occasional visitation is usually the most economical method to be used.

4.	Contractor Personnel
The Contractor shall provide English-speaking and foreign language translators, skilled personnel, with the professional and management services necessary to successfully meet Government requirements.  Required skill categories are defined in terms of typical duties and performance level standards.

The Contractor shall provide skill levels and labor mix appropriate for the task(s) to be performed.

The Contractor and Contractor employees shall conduct only business covered by this contract during periods paid for by the Government and shall not conduct any other business on Government premises.

Federal regulations prohibit the use of any controlled substances and alcoholic beverages while Contractor employees are working on Federal property or in Federal installations.  Contractor personnel shall be made aware of these requirements prior to commencing work under this contract.

All Contractor personnel shall be United States (U.S.) citizens or permanent residents.  Any exceptions to the citizenship requirement in the United States, territories, and possessions must involve individuals legally in the country, holding valid work permits.  All services provided by persons who are not United States citizens require the prior written approval of the CO.

Contractor personnel are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and courteous manner at all times.  Inappropriate conduct and/or substance abuse will not be tolerated.  The Contractor will be responsible for removing the individual from t

If unusual behavior and conditions threaten the orderly conduct of business occurring during the course of an assignment, the Contractor will be responsible for removing the individual from the facility and taking other action as appropriate.

If the Contractor personnel must speak and read in a language other than English, or have other required skills, the Government will state those requirements in the task order request and subsequent task order.

5.	Training  
The Contractor, at its own expense, shall perform training, except: 

The Government will provide orientation and training on specific department, unit, site, programs or education requirements, policies, and procedures peculiar to the work to be performed by the Contractor. 

If the Contractor changes employees during the performance of tasks frequently enough to interfere with Government operations and impose a burden on Government training staff, the Contractor will be subject to training cost negotiation, in addition to review of whether performance levels have been met.

Limited training of Contractor employees may be authorized (i.e., when the client changes software systems during the performance of an ongoing task and it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to retain a Contractor employee for corporate experience and familiarity with the project in progress.)

The Government will not authorize training for Contractor employees to attend seminars, symposiums, or user group conferences unless certified by the Contractor that attendance is mandatory for the performance of task requirements and such training is approved in advance by the Project Officer.

Training at Government expense shall not be authorized for replacement personnel for the sole purpose of keeping Contractor employees abreast of advances in the state-of-the-art technology or for training Contractor employees on equipment, computer languages, and computer operating systems for which training is available on the commercial market.

The systems shall be capable of providing historical and in-process workload data segregated by task order. 

7.	Transition and Succession
The Contractor shall have a transition and succession plan that demonstrates the capability to ensure a smooth transition with current contracts and/or successor contracts with a minimum of disruption to customer services.

Within 15 calendar days of contract award, the Government will meet with the Project Officer to identify Contractor employees who have provided services to various customer agencies under other contracts that may be transitioned to this contract.  Determinations will be made in cases where there is some question as to whether a person would be continuing to perform the same or substantially the same service for CDC.

At the end of the contract period, the Contractor may be required to continue performance to complete tasks (as compared to level of effort task orders) issued prior to the effective date of any successor contract, unless terminated by the CO. The Contractor shall also be expected to work with the follow-on Contractor(s) to ensure a smooth transition.

<DESC>NARA IS WORKING ON THE ANSWERS TO VENDORS' INQUIRIES AND WILL BE POSTED ON FEDBIZOPP.

Background:


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Among these records are the Decennial Population (and Housing) Censuses, created by the Bureau of the Census, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.



The objective of this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice (RFI) is to determine whether any non-profit or for-profit entities are interested in forming a partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to provide electronic access to the records of the 1940 Decennial Census of Population and Housing in 2012, and under what terms such a partnership might be established.  The nature of this partnership is described below.  The Decennial Population Census has been taken every 10 years since 1790 by the Bureau of the Census.  Under Title 13, United States Code, these records are restricted from public disclosure, except for aggregated statistical data without personal identifiers, until such a time as the individual privacy rights of those identified in the census forms, known as schedules, have expired.  The date when the information can be released to the public has been determined to be 72 years from the date of the Census.



NARA has a statutory obligation not only to make these records available but also to sell complete copies of the 1940 census.  In previous releases of decennial census records, copies of microfilm rolls containing the census records were sold by NARA.  Along with the Census schedules are so-called Soundex rolls that served as an index to some of the schedules.  There are Soundex rolls for the 1880 through 1920 Censuses, and a partial Soundex for the 1930 Census.  There is no Soundex for the 1940 and later Censuses. In recent years, private for-profit companies have purchased the Census microfilm from NARA and digitized the microfilm to make it available to researchers using the Internet, along with other Federal and non-Federal records and databases of genealogical interest.  The public has now come to expect that such records are readily available and searchable by name via the Internet.  In accordance with NARA's Strategic Plan, NARA plans to make available digital copies of the census records.  


Goal 4 of the strategic Plan states: 


We will provide prompt, easy, and secure access to our holdings anywhere, anytime; and  
NARA has identified 2 applicable strategies to achieve this goal. 
A. For the broadest possible access, we will make digital copies of selected non-electronic records available online.  We will identify these holdings in a digitization plan that sets priorities for putting these holdings online. 
B. We will work to establish partnerships with both governmental and private institutions to facilitate the availability of NARA holdings over the Internet, in accordance with appropriate Government laws, regulations, policy, and guidance. 


The strategic plan also contains specific language that addresses digitization.  It says that NARA will work to digitize selected records, including those most requested by researchers, and will put searchable descriptions of all our holdings online with clear information about the archival context of the original records and how they may be located and used. 


The strategic plan is available online at: http://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/.

Description
Request for Information (RFI) for the 1940 Decennial Population Census Digital Reformatting and Access Project


The following information describes the scope of the project:


Original Records: 4,643 rolls of 35mm microfilm
Existing Index: None.  A name index must be created.


Records Security: Access to records is restricted by Title 13, USC.  All handling of records must follow Census Bureau's security requirements and procedures.  These requirements include having every person with access to Census information swear in writing (Special Sworn Status) that they will never release any information on the Census to anyone else until the date of official public release (see below).
Limits on Indexing: If name index is done prior to release date, it must be done within the US.


Release Date: April 2, 2012


Type of Re-formatting: Digitization, 8-bit gray scale, to be by NARA staff.


NARA plans to digitize the records in-house using NARA staff.  This is for both cost and security reasons.  NARA will also prepare the electronic equivalent of roll lists, which more broadly identify the records by State and County or City.  Currently we have made no decisions about creating or purchasing other finding aids such as those we made available for the 1930 Census, such as color reproductions of enumeration district (ED) maps or city directories.


NARA is looking for a partner to create a searchable name index to the microfilm in exchange for the right to fulfill orders for segments of the index and the right to charge a reasonable subscription fee to institutions and individuals for access to the index.  Access to the digitized records will remain free.  The number and type of data fields or elements to be captured by the index must be addressed in the response to the RFI.  The estimated cost of producing the index must be included as part of any response to the RFI.


Access to the records and the complete index will be provided free of charge at NARA'S Archives I facility in Washington, DC, and at all of the NARA regional archives facilities where Census microfilm is available.  These regional facilities are located in Waltham, MA (suburban Boston); Pittsfield, MA; New York City; Philadelphia; Morrow, GA (suburban Atlanta); Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO; Ft. Worth, TX; Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; San Bruno, CA (suburban San Francisco); Laguna Niguel, CA (Orange Co., CA); and Anchorage, AK.  Under the terms of any agreement, NARA will not permit the copying of any part of the index while using NARA'S website or at NARA location during the period of the agreement but will expect that its patrons will be permitted free access and print capability during their visit.  The digital images of the Census will be available for free on the Internet to all users but it is understood that without the index, the images themselves are of very limited research value.


NARA is interested in recouping its costs to digitize the microfilm and therefore will expect that a royalty fee will be paid by the concessionaire based on the gross revenue of sales of partial indexes and copies of the images on DVD or other hard electronic media.


This RFI is the first step that NARA plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation. 


Response Instructions 


NARA requests that responses are submitted in Microsoft Word format or if necessary, other products from the Microsoft Suite.  Briefly describe your company or institution, your products, past and current projects, and current services, history, ownership, financial information, the number of employees, and other information you deem relevant.  Please provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number, and email.  You are encouraged to provide comments on the 1940 Population Census Re-formatting and Access Project approach.  Respond only if you can provide the total solution to this project.  Discuss technically feasible alternatives and provide non-binding order of magnitude cost and schedule estimates. Indicate whether your solution or product is commercially available or is on the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule.  Supplemental product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may also be submitted.  Furthermore, please include substantive responses to the following:


1) Understanding that indexing cannot be conducted outside the United States and that anyone with access to any part of the Census before its public release date must have Special Sworn Status: a) what work processes will you employ to create a name index and (b) how would you ensure that the Census Bureau's security requirements are met while the records are in your custody?


2) Do you believe there will be a market for copies of or access to partial indexes by State or other geographic subdivision, and why?  What is your strategy for tapping into that market?


3) If granted a "concession" to be the exclusive distributor of copies of the 1940 Census to the public, how many years do you anticipate having a need for the concession?  Explain why you need the concession for that period of time.


4) In order to re-coup its expenses, NARA anticipates charging a royalty as part of the "concession" agreement.  Do you provide royalties to other archives or libraries and how are they determined?


5) Discuss the potential data storage requirements for this project and your capacity to both store and provide public access via the Internet.


6) Provide feedback on our requirements.  Specifically provide comments on any requirements that you believe cannot be implemented.  Describe how you would organize the requirements so that both NARA and your company or organization can make the 1940 Census publicly available at a reasonable cost and still receive sufficient compensation to offset the cost of providing the records digitally.


7) Identify possible constraints or potential risks.


8) What tools and metrics do you use to measure system performance?


9) Describe your IT security program.


10) Describe the type of contractual agreement and pricing structure that you envision.


11) Describe your disaster recovery program.


12) Would your firm or organization be interested in giving an informational presentation to the NARA?


Contact Information


Please submit responses via email not later than 4:00 PM on 08/17/2007 to paul.premoe@nara.gov.  The subject of the email should be "1940 Census RFI Response".

<DESC>Amendment 01 posted 16 August 2007<br><br>

Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.

The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<CONTACT>Roberta Hatch, 937-904-6692
<DESC>Notice of Small Business Set Aside The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical Systems Center  (ASC) program. The F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) is an  Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance &  repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU). The system  consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary equipment,  and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations and the  depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill. The  station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to maintain  and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY08 unless known obsolescence  for a variety of component parts is addressed.  The overarching program  objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission Capable (NMC).  The  government plans to issue, tentatively set for Sep 2007, a request for  proposal that will require offerors to provide a plan that provides  retrofit hardware improvements addressing obsolete parts within the  planned funding profile and meets the overarching program objective.  Respondents should maximize addressing the projected component  obsolescence issues within the planned funding profile, i.e., address as  many components as possible with the given amount of funding. In addition,  offerors will be required to demonstrate improvement to station MTBF as  well as meeting the current performance requirements. IAW FAR 19.502-2 Total Small Business Set-Asides the proposed contract  is 100% set aside for small business concerns.  The requirements North  American Industry Classification System Code is 336413 Other Aircraft  Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing with a small business size  standard of 1000 employees. The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this small  business set aside announcement or otherwise pay for any information  received herein.

When applicable, Contract Clause No. FAR 52.219-4, entitled, Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns will be applied to this procureme nt.  This project is for the construction of a 38,000 SF facility for AFSPC satellite control operations with DCCS and AGSI missions also occupying space in the facility.  The project includes the foundations for 3 antennas, back-up power generator, UPS and pri ority 2 security systems (double fencing, sensors and cameras reporting to SF central monitoring system.)   The acquisition method is negotiated procurement.  Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required.  The basis for award is Best Value Tradeoff.  This process permits tradeoffs among costs or price and non-cost factors and allows the Gove rnment to award to a superior offeror which is not the lowest priced offer but which is significantly more technically advantageous than the lowest offeror so as to justify payment of a higher price.  It is the Governments intent to award based on initial  offers without discussions.  Relative weighting of technical and price is as follows:  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  Evaluation factors may consists of the following: (1) Past Performance on projects similar in nature; (2) Specialized experience in constructing DoD facilities that serve as part of the world-wide satellite communications network, employing high reliability power and HVAC systems, foundations and utility interconnectivity with satellite communications antennas, and control & monitoring for restricted access to the complex ; (3) Key Personnel, including construction members;  (4) Project Management Plan that emphasizes communications with and responsiveness  to multiple users that will share the facility; ability to respond to user-installed equipment technology upgrades throughout the construction period, and aggressiveness in meeting or exceeding the construction period timelines, and (5) Small Business Uti lization Opportunities.  The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive. Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,000,000.00.  If the offeror is a large business, the fi rm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package.  The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the bidder ineligible for award of the conta ct.  To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 19.705.  The Los An geles District subcontracting goals are specific percentages of the contractors total planned subcontract amount.  The goals are as follows: 51.2% with small business, 8.8% with small disadvantaged business, 7.3% with woman owned small business, 1.5% with service disabled veteran owned small business and 3.1% with hub zone small business.  All interested contractors are reminded that the successful contractor will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantag ed firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507.

<DESC>The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, has a requirement to conduct specialized geologic and geochemical laboratory analysis of cores that were collected during the 2006 National Gas Hydrate Research Program (NGHP) Indian Ocean Expedition 01.  The Department of Earth Sciences at the University of New Hampshire, participated in the USGS managed NGHP Expedition 01 during the summer 2006.  The Department of Earth Sciences was responsible for managing the sedimentology lab on the research ship.  As part of this effort, the USGS and its research partner, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) of India collected 2,847 meters of sediment cores.  The USGS now requires specialized analysis of the cores collected during this expedition.  As part of the field effort under NGHP Expedition 01, the acquired sediment cores were split and sub-sampled, with representative sedimentary sections and sub-samples being sent to the Department of Earth Sciences. The cores under this requirement are being stored at the Department of Earth Sciences.  Because this is the first expedition ever allowed to core along the eastern margin of India, no other group in the world is as familiar with the geology of sampled geological section and no other group has access to the required core samples from the eastern margin of India.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of NH, Durham, NH 03824, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.

<SUBJECT>R -- Conduct Census of Commercial Fisherman in Puerto Rico
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-7-21244SLW
<RESPDATE>082707
<ARCHDATE>08272007
<CONTACT>Sharon Walker, Contract Specialist, Phone (816)426-7470      , Fax 816) 426-7530, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>The NMFS intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC) in San Juan, PR., to coordinate the work required by the SEFSC to conduct a census of commercial fishermen in Puerto Rico. The CFMC is uniquely qualified to coordinate the work required by the SEFSC to conduct a census of commercial fishermen in Puerto Rico, particularly considering that local fisheries agencies are members of the Council. To our knowledge, no other organization exists which is capable of carrying out the necessary work and to mobilize the required coordinated effort of commercial fishers, fishing organizations, and territorial fishery management scientists and officials in the performance of this project. The government is not aware of any other entity that could provide an equivalent combination of academic and  experience without delays in the implementation of the project.
 
The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA, particularly National Standard 8, NS 8), National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), and Executive Order (EO) 12898 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations) require that social impact analyses be conducted when federal agencies propose new regulations. 

Due to the lack of manpower to conduct a full-blown fishermen census, the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) is seeking support to collect socio-economic data to assist in the preparation of fishery management plans and amendments in the U.S. Caribbean. While earlier censuses of Puerto Rican commercial fishermen are available, these censuses are now outdated and are inadequate to meet the new legal definitions and requirements put forth by MSA, NEPA, and EO 12898. Because of specific nature of these legal mandates, there is an urgent need to conduct new research consistent with these new definitions and guidelines. Assessments of social impacts on fishing communities cannot be conducted with confidence without the ability to identify the current participants. The objective of the proposed work is to conduct a census of commercial fishermen in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to: a) assess the economic contribution of the commercial fishing to the overall Puerto Rican economy and b) investigate the economic impacts of fishery regulations on coastal communities.

The proposed project will have the following components:
-Development of survey instrument 
-Fieldwork.
-Estimation of impacts and documentation

The final task of the project will include the following subtasks:

-Database design, data entry and quality control..
-Report writing and production.

The anticipated performance period is date of award through August 31, 2008.
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications, and any additional supporting literature.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the technical ability and demonstrated past experience to meet the requirements described in the description section above.
Vendor must provide a DUNS number (http://www.dnb.com/us/)and register with the Central Contractors Registration (http://www.ccr.gov/) to further qualify for this contract. Include DUNS number on written quote.

<CONTACT>Charles Newman, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-451-9365, Fax 301-480-4675, Email newmanc@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>Background:
This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Extramural Activities (DEA) is interested in identifying whether there are any interested organizations with expertise in assessing procedures for the conduct of personnel security clearances in place at foreign institutions.  An assessment of the procedures for the conduct of personnel security clearances must be conducted prior to the NIAID approving the use of funds under a grant or contract to a foreign institution for work with select agents.    

Select agents are biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to animal health, to plant health, or to animal or plant products.  To prevent the misuse of select agents, the United States issued federal regulations, including the Final Rule 42 CFR Part 73, 7 CFR Part 331, and 9 CFR Part 121 for the use, possession and transfer of select agents regulated by, respectively, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/pdfs/42_cfr_73_final_rule.pdf ) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)  (http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20051800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2005/pdf/05-5063.pdf).  One of the requirements of the regulations is that all individuals who access select agents must have an approved security risk assessment by having their background checked by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division (Section 73.10, 331.10 and 121.10 of the Final Rules).  

These U.S. regulations are adopted by the NIAID select agent policy, which requires that U.S. grantees and contractors comply with the requirements of the U.S. regulations before the funds on select agent research can be used.  For foreign grantees and contractors, the NIAID select agent policy requires the awardees to provide information about their institutional safety and security procedures and measures for the use, possession, and transfer of select agents, including their procedures for the individual security risk assessment, so that it can be assessed whether the procedures and measures are comparable to those described in the U.S. regulations.  The assessment of the procedures and measures will be reviewed by the NIAID Interagency Select Agent Review Group (ISARG), who will provide a recommendation to the director of Division of Extramural Activities (DEA) for the approval of the use of funds on select agent research conducted at the foreign institutions.       
 
Scope:
It is estimated that there will be, annually, three or four foreign grantees/contractors whose projects involve select agents and are, therefore, required to comply with the NIAID select agent policy.  

The primary purpose of this announcement is to identify whether there are interested organizations with the demonstrated expertise in global security risk assessment needed to assess the information or procedures regarding the conduct of personnel security clearances provided by the foreign awardees and to report to the NIAID whether the procedures are effective and reliable.   Additionally, interested organizations are requested to provide evidence of their demonstrated capability to conduct or assist in the conduct of background checks on a foreign awardees staff; as such capabilities may also be required by the NIAID. 
   
Objective: 
To be deemed capable to perform this requirement an organization must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability to:
1) To review a foreign institution?s procedures for the conduct of personnel security clearances for individuals who have access to select agents and to assess whether the procedures are effective and reliable. 
2) To provide recommendations of what changes are needed, if the procedure is deemed not to be effective and reliable.

Additionally, it is requested that interested organizations please provide:
1) Information on whether they can provide such services off of the GSA Schedule. 
2) Approaches and methodologies to pricing such services. 


Responses:
Interested organizations that believe they have the capabilities necessary to successfully perform this requirement may submit a Capability Statement to Mr. Charles Newman, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at newmanc@mail.nih.gov by 1:00 P.M. EDT on September 7, 2007.  Please note that there is no standard form or format for such Capability Statements.  However, at a minimum your submission must clearly provide the information concerning your organization?s capabilities in an organized manner.  Responses should be limited to no more than 20 pages and should clearly address each of the competencies stated above.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561611.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is $11.5 million in annual receipts.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a small business and a guide on size standards.  If Capability Statements received in response to this announcement indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated subsequent solicitation may be 100% set-aside for small businesses.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZONE, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.
  
The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time. Please be advised that all information submitted will be considered proprietary.  No material submitted for review will be returned and there will be no formal or informal debriefing to a respondent concerning the review of their submitted material.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Survey of Software Tools to Support Collection Coordination Intelligence Requirements Management (CCIRM) Process
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) is performing a survey of tools that support the Collection Coordination Intelligence Requirements Management (CCIRM) Process. All qualified firms are invited to participate in this survey. 

The CCIRM process is applied in Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. It is designed to provide a timely flow of intelligence to supported and supporting commanders. The CCIRM process provides a dedicated management structure through which the commander?s priority intelligence requirements (PIR) are expressed. The CCIRM process facilitates the most economic use of available sensors in order to ensure the timely satisfaction of the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance collection requirements. The process requires large amounts of input from various sources and undergoes frequent changes and updates. As such, the CCIRM process is most efficiently conducted when supported by a software tool. CCIRM tools have been used and demonstrated during exercises under the auspices of the Multi-Sensor Aerospace/Ground Joint ISR Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC).
 
The aim of this survey is to identify available CCIRM tools. NC3A will create a short list of suitable candidates that could be used in current NATO operations.

To support the survey, U.S. firms are requested to provide information regarding CCIRM tools that they may have developed or are developing. At this stage, NC3A is seeking information of the type normally used in advertising or in a press release. As the information is received and analyzed, NC3A may follow up by requesting more detailed information from a particular firm.

The information required for the survey should include the following:

- The CCIRM tool name
- A brief functional description
- Hardware requirements
- High-level documentation on capability
- Availability for use in NATO operations (export/technology controls, IPR restrictions, etc.)
- An approximate delivery schedule (When could the CCIRM tool be made available?)
- An estimate of costs (ROM), such as purchasing and maintenance of licenses

No later than 25 September 2007, U.S. firms should submit their information to the Department of Commerce, which will forward the information to NC3A. U.S. firms should send their information to the following Department of Commerce address: lcarpent@bis.doc.gov

Sole source acquisitions for the following, Remel Inc. Description of Acquisition: (1) V. Choleras antisera set #679817, (2) V. Choleras antisera polyvalent #678831, (3) V. Cholera antisera Inaba # 679824. This purchase orders will provide the CFSAN/ FERN scientists under strict and CDC approved protocols use the various kits or reagents requested by the above mentioned vendor to develop methods used for training and the detection of foodborne contaminates which maybe a result of acts of terrorism or natural occurring events that effect our nations food source.  The knowledge and information obtained regarding this method for detecting foodborne disease and associated phenomena will enhance CFSAN?s ability to protect and enhance the safety of the food supply. The FDA has a critical need for kits and reagents used to detect the characterization of foodborne pathogens. The methods used in the detection program make reproducibility and ease of use the ?gold standard?, and this can only be conducted using known and proven methods that have been approved by CDC for all labs in the USA to measure and detect microbial phenotypes.  As the only known standard kits capable of providing the capability necessary, the Remel V. Cholera antiserum test kits provides uniformity with the de facto international standard for research and rapid response.  To select any other kits and reagents would place FDA/CFSAN research in this area out of step with the research community and would reduce both the capability and credibility of research in this critical scientific arena. Remel, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the V. Cholera antiserums and supplies and accessories.   No other method has been approved by CDC for the detection program submitted by FDA-CFSAN under the select agent registered program and there are no potential substitutes.

<SUBJECT>--The Army Operational Employment Database
<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award the Purchase of the Army Operational Employment Database (AOED) from DFI International, Inc. The Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE), Army Contracting Agency, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Detica DFI located at 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Ste 1200, Washington, DC to provide a current and comprehensive record of the worldwide  cumulative demands on Active Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard Forces, which can be used to support a wide array of analytical requreiments for the Center for Army Analysis for the period of  30 September 2007 to 29 September 2008.   This announcement is in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(2).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability statements no later than 23 August 2007 3:00pm EST.   The capability statements should include the company name, address, contact inform ation, business size, and  detailed explanation of how your organization can meet the requirement described herein.  All statements should be submitted via email to Ms. Yong N. Foston, Contract Specialist at yong.foston@hqda.army.mil.   Individual response s containing company proprietary information must be marked accordingly. Such information will not be released outside the Government.  Furthermore, the Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any technical information id entified (e.g., limited and/or restricted rights). Army Operational Employment Database (AOED) STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) 1.  GENERAL.   The Army Operational Employment Database (AOED) is a relational database of historical data on U.S. Army deployments to Lesser Contingency and Major Combat Operations from September 11, 2001 to the present time.  The primary objective of the  database is to provide a current and comprehensive record of the worldwide cumulative demands on Active Army, Army Reserve, and National Guard forces, which can be used to support a wide array of analytical requirements.  This work will update and maintai n the database to keep it current, while improving and modifying the database to better support the analysis of emerging force management issues. 2.  BACKGROUND.  a. During the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the lack of accurate historical records on Army deployments inhibited the Armys analysis of major combat and lesser contingency operations.  Following the 2001 QDR, the G-8 Army QDR Off ice contracted the development of a centrally managed repository of Army operational deployments.  In 2004, the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) assumed the Contracting Officer Responsibility (COR) for the database.  The AOED is now used to support the analy sis of a wide range of force management and employment issues, particularly the analysis of the cumulative demand on Army forces.  Although the Army maintains a number of different data sources which report the types and number of soldiers deployed to spec ific types of operations, the ability to identify and analyze total force employment and utilization trends using these sources is significantly limited by incomplete information, varying data formats, and the lack of sufficient querying capabilities. The AOED is the only centrally managed database which can be used to accurately and rapidly show the total demand on Army forces.  b. However, the AOED must be continually updated with the most recent operations to remain useful and new capabilities are requir ed as new force management issues arise.  Although the AOED data for operations outside the U.S. has high fidelity, data on Homeland Defense (HLD) and Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) missions within the U.S. is incomplete.  The AOED currently c aptures Title 10 Guard deployments, but it has only limited personnel data and no unit data on Title 32 and State Active Duty missions.  Additionally, exporting the amount of data required to show selected deployment trends over time currently exceeds MS E XCEL capability, hindering an a nalysts ability to quickly produce graphs and charts of these trends over time.  Analysts can export data from the AOED to MS ACCESS, manipulate the data, and import the data to EXCEL pivot tables, but the process is currently straining the capability of analyst PCs and will only get worse as the database grows larger.  Analysts must be able to use the AOED to rapidly produce charts and graphs showing deployment trends and demand on Army forces.   c. Significant Benefit to the Army:  The Army can use the A OED to obtain an accurate and comprehensive view of the historical demand on Army forces, which will help senior leaders make critical force management decisions.  Additionally, the AOED queries can identify the capabilities used in specific types of opera tions (particularly Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and irregular warfare) so that Army leaders can examine the sufficiency of the programmed force to execute future missions.  The Army can use an up-to-date and comprehensive AOED to support Army participat ion in developing Defense Planning Scenario (DPS) language and building Army force lists for Multi-Service Force Development (MSFD) scenarios.  In the long term, the Army will benefit by maintaining a single repository of deployment data which can be acces sed rapidly to support the analysis of Operational Availability (OA-08) and the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) issues related to force strategy.  3. OBJECTIVE.  The contractor will collect, integrate, and maintain deployment data within the AOED, a comprehensive, secure, relational database of all Army training and operational deployments and major exercises for the Center for Army Analysis.  Additionally, the contractor will assist the Center for Army Analysis in constructing representative forces l ists and analyzing Army deployments since 11 September 2001.  Force deployment information on all named operational deployments; including but not limited to:  the employment of forces in major combat and lesser contingency operations, HLD and DSCA operati ons, Joint and Combined exercises, support to other services, coalition/partnership training, State Department taskings, NATO or other allied security cooperation agreements, and forces which may be deployed in support of experimentation or to Combat Train ing Centers will be collated and integrated into the database.  For the purpose of populating the AOED, a major training exercise will, at a minimum, equate to a deployment away from local training area involving CINC provided funds.  This data will includ e reserve component activities of the Army National Guard (ARNG) and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR).  The contractor will not provide data to third parties without explicit approval of the Center for Army Analysis.  The contractor will maintain a capability for rapidly creating graphs and charts of the data which show deployment trends over time. 4. CONTRACT TYPE.  Time and materials. 5.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION.  Generally, all work will take place at the contractors facility.  If the contract does not have access to SIPRNET, a SIPRNET terminal will be available at the Center for Army Analysis for use by the contract or to gather deployment data required to populate the AOED. 6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.  This effort is for a period of 12 months.  7.  SECURITY.  The data required for the tasks in this SOW could be classified up to the SECRET collateral level.  Occasional  access to SECRET/REL NATO may also be required.  All contractor personnel supporting this contract must have at least a SECRET clearance.  The contractor will adhere to DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, which would be incorporat ed into the task order at time of award.  The contractor will fax security clearance information of personnel performing under this task order to Center for Army Analysis, Attn: CSCA-R (Ms. Johnson), 6001 Goethals Road, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5230.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     Solicitation number AG-7B31-S-07-0016 is being issued as an Invitation for Bid.     This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-12.     Offerors are to provide a bid for the following:                                                           

The scanning probe microscope should have the ability to use a large range closed-loop scanner and a small range scanner for applications ranging from textile and non-woven fiber analysis to protein quaternary structure/DNA imaging and force spectroscopy.

The system should have at least the following minimum specifications:

1. Must support an environmental chamber to be integrated with the microscope head for fast sample loading, have a gasket seal for complete isolation of gases in the chamber from the scanner and have a minimum of four ports for gas and/or electrical connectors. The chamber must be constructed of optically transparent and solvent/acid/base resistant material to allow viewing of the sample during operation.  The chamber should be air-tight at moderate positive and negative pressures (as opposed to a "purge chamber" requiring a continuous flow of gasses).  The system must be compatible and tolerant of a condensing environment as well.
 
2. Heating and cooling options (minimum total range that can be covered is -30C to 250C) must be available for air and solution imaging.  All heating and cooling options should be compatible with fluid cells and fluid operation or while under gaseous environmental control.  Temperature control accuracy should be 0.1C or better.  The system quoted should include an air/fluid sample heater with a temperature range from ambient to 250C.
 
3. All imaging should be done with a top down scanner (sample always stationary and tip/cantilever scanning) for sample size flexibility and adaptability of system to inverted light microscopes.  This type of design also removes the danger of scanner damage from fluids.
 
4. All scanner and detector electronic components should be sealed from the sample environment. 
 
5. System should be able to perform oscillating probe AFM techniques in fluid which include both quoted acoustic mode and optional magnetically coupled mode.
 
6. System should include current sensing AFM measurement capability (CSAFM).  CSAFM shall have a detection sensitivity of 1nA/V and should be able to be carried out under controlled environment and/or controlled temperature in order to enable molecular resolution.  All necessary components to perform this technique should be included.

7. The system must accommodate samples of at least 50mm x 50mm and have provisions for imaging samples on glass slides and cover slips.  The system must be able to resolve the atomic lattice structure of Mica in contact mode deflection images in order to demonstrate high resolution capabilities of system.  The system must be capable of the same atomic lattice structure resolution while on an inverted light microscope (Zeiss, Nikon, or Olympus).


8. System should include a fluid cell.  Fluid cells must fit on interchangeable sample plates for heating, cooling, or Magnetic and acoustic AC modes.
	- Fluid cell should be constructed of Kel-F (or similar) and be available in Teflon.
	- Fluid cell should be held with quick clamping mechanism for fast assembly.
	- Fluid cells should be priced economically (< $200 US) so that they can be conveniently replaced or spares provided to prevent cross-contamination of biological experiments or allow multiple users to prepare for experiments simultaneously
		
9. Sample plates/holders must be interchangeable with options for heating, cooling, Magnetic and acoustic AC, or electrochemistry modes.
	- Must be compatible with fluid cells described elsewhere.
 	- Must have quick clamping electrode holders for all EC electrodes.
	- Must have integral connector for electrochemistry electrode connections.

10. The system must have provisions for hermetically sealed scanner assemblies, with o-ring seals. Motorized vertical approach with the option of individual control of each motor for sample tilt compensation should be standard.  Automatic, motorized engagement should be standard.

11. The system must be adaptable to inverted light microscope stage, stand alone, video microscope and environmental chamber configurations with the appropriate mounts.

12. Scanners must have interchangeable cantilever holders that are hermetically sealed from the environment and provide for the following modes of operation: STM, AFM, CSAFM, Oscillating probe/AC-AFM, EFM, LFM, MAC, MFM, etc. The system quoted should include such cantilever holders for AFM, CSAFM, AC-AFM, EFM, and MFM operation in air, fluid, controlled temperature, or controlled environments.  The system quoted should include separate large range (90um x 90um x 7um) and small range (9um x 9um x um) scanners.  Scanners and cantilever holders must allow a Z axis, 90 degree optical view for tip placement and laser alignment in air or under fluid.  Large scanner must include closed-loop control of XY&Z axes with software selectable on/off switch.  Toggling on/off the closed-loop control shall not require the user to stop scanning.

13. Sample environment must allow combinations of environmental conditions, such as electrochemistry, heating/cooling, and controlled gas/solvent environment without damage to the system. 

14. System must include full computer control and software package running under Windows XP.  Computer should connect to system via USB or similar in order for computer to be user replaceable or laptop driven, if so desired, in order to keep computer upgrade costs low.  In addition to the common characteristics of SPM computers/controllers, the computer/software should support the following:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
CEREC INLAB DENTAL RESTORATION SYSTEM AND MILLING ACTIVATION KEYS
Purchase NR: FM480362690009

I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL ACTIVITY REQUESTING THE REQUIREMENT
Contracting Activity: 20th Contracting Squadron 321 Cullen Street Shaw AFB, SC 29152
Requesting Activity: 20TH Medical Group/SGSL 431 Meadowlark St. 
Shaw AFB SC 29152 

II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED
A new firm-fixed priced contract shall be awarded to purchase the following brand name item, CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Keys. The use of such brand name description in this acquisition is essential to the Government?s requirement, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS
The CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System is used for dental lab cases requesting all ceramic structures. This unit will reduce production time to mill dental structures. Under this contemplated contract, Sirona Dental Systems will provide the following items. The purchase request is for one each CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and one lot of Milling Activation Keys (AK2000) will include a 24-month warranty and 3-days of hands on training to be conducted at Shaw AFB SC. This acquisition has an estimated delivery date of 60 days after award of contract. 
?One each CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System part number 5884742.  This system is a 3-D CAD/CAM (computer-assisted design/computer-assisted machining) unit designed for use in a dental laboratory to design and fabricate fully-contoured all-ceramic inlays, on lays, copings, crowns and 3-unit fixed partial denture substructures from millable ceramic blocks. The CEREC inLab creates a digital image by scanning a die and then generates and displays a 3-dimensional restoration on the screen. The technician can alter the design to suit individual preferences. (see catalog at www.inLab.com ). Price includes full system components, hardware, CEREC inLab system, AK 100 Milling activation key, software, operating manuals, and 3-days training course at delivery location. The CEREC inLab requires a conventional Pentium 4 PC and reduces the time it takes to fabricate items such as crowns from 11 hours to 25 minutes.
?One each Milling Activation Key, part number AK2000 (2000 units). These milling keys are required for CEREC systems using the inLab milling unit  

IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement.?  

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 
A. United States Air Force?s (USAF) Dental Evaluation and Consultation Service study was conducted in 2004 to evaluate the operational efficiency of this unit and it the unit received an ?Excellent? rating for use in USAF facilities. I discussed this acquisition with Colonel Alan Sutton the Director of Peterson Area Dental Laboratory who is also the military consultant to the Surgeon General for Prosthodontics/Dental Laboratories. He stated that Air Staff has determined it is essential that CAD/CAM equipment capabilities be standardized across the Air Force. Accordingly Colonel Sutton is instructing Air Force Bases to purchase CEREC name brand equipment and instructs units to go sole source directly to Sirona Dental Systems as most advantageous to the Government. 
B. Market research revealed that Sirona Dental Systems is the only manufacturer of the CEREC brand name equipment. They are committed to technological innovation, manufacturing excellence, and dedicated to creating and producing the finest dental equipment available. Their products represent cutting-edge of modern dental treatment, research, and development. An example of this can be seen in their inLab CAD/CAM dental systems which made Sirona the leader in the dental laboratory market.  
C. The 20th Contracting Squadron believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force?s requirements.
Accordingly, Sirona Dental Systems is the only firm capable of providing the dental equipment described in Section III above without the U. S. Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.

VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE 
A. Market research conducted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBusOpps) revealed the following sources sought results.
1. Solicitation number FM480063560349 posted on 28 December 2007 by the 1st Contracting Squadron stated they were soliciting purchase of CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key on a sole source basis and they intend to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order with Sirona Dental Systems. 
2. Solicitation number F4D4A16233A600 posted on 12 September 2006 by 30th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract with Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key.
3. Solicitation FM485262431204 posted 9 September 2006 by 99th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key.
4. Solicitation number VA-SNOTE-060130-001 posted 30 January 2006 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for various CEREC brand name dental equipment to include Milling Activation Key on behalf of 437th Medical Group, Charleston AFB SC.
B. Other Actions. Other brand name CAD/CAM dental equipment is available that can provide similar services/capabilities but cost two to three times more. The mandate from Air Staff that it is essential CAD/CAM equipment capabilities be standardized across the Air Force precludes purchasing other brand name systems with similar capabilities. Market research has revealed that this particular CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System has already been acquired by numerous other Air Force Bases to include; Peterson Area Dental Laboratory, Hickam AFB HI, Patrick AFB FL, Kadena and McConnell AFBs.  Peterson Area Dental Laboratory is the central-hub for dental procedure/support for Shaw AFB. See Section VIII for actions taken to facilitate competition for this acquisition. All other actions to locate other sources were unsuccessful

VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE 
A. The CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System is part of a larger integrated dental capability initiative to standardized future 3-D capable dental equipment and CAD/CAM software across the Air Force per Air Staff directive. Discussions with Sirona Dental Systems revealed the following.  
1. The military is one of a few organizations that are allowed to purchase the system directly from the manufacturer (Sirona Dental Systems) thus saving thousands of dollars off the standard retail price if purchased through a distributor.
2. There are only a couple of dealers/wholesalers through which to purchase this CEREC dental system.  Patterson Dental Supply is the exclusive dealer for CEREC type system in US and Canada. Individual distributors add on appropriate pricing to the manufacturer?s price to meet their individual expenses and profit margins.
B. The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated cost of this equipment is considered fair and reasonable based on the unique Air Force wide hardware/software integration initiative and the information provided in this justification and approval document.  

VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED
As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.
A. Market research discussions with Sirona Dental Systems revealed the following.  
1. The military is one of a few organizations that are allowed to purchase the system directly from the manufacturer.
2. Normally, if purchased from a distributor the 3-day training course enrollment fee and materials are included in the price but the organization must pay travel expenses to Brea California or Amherst NY. If purchased directly from manufacturer (Sirona) the manufacturer will conduct the 3-day training course at Shaw AFB. 
B. I spoke with the contracting unit at Patrick AFB. Based on their market research, they made the determination that it was advantageous to the Government to purchase the CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System directly from Sirona Dental Systems. 
C. Market research conducted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBusOpps) revealed the following.
1. Solicitation number FM480063560349 posted on 28 December 2007 by the 1st Contracting Squadron stated they were soliciting purchase of CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key on a sole source basis and they intend to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order with Sirona Dental Systems.
2. Solicitation number F4D4A16233A600 posted on 12 September 2006 by 30th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract with Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key. 
3. Solicitation FM485262431204 posted 9 September 2006 by 99th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System and Milling Activation Key. 
4. Solicitation number VA-SNOTE-060130-001 posted 30 January 2006 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for various CEREC brand name dental equipment to include Milling Activation Key on behalf of 437th Medical Group, Charleston AFB SC.   

IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 
Sirona Dental Systems is the sole manufacturer of this CEREC inLab Dental Restoration System. There are only a few dealers/wholesalers through which to purchase this system.  Patterson Dental Supply is the exclusive dealer for CEREC type system in US and Canada. Individual distributors add on appropriate pricing to meet their individual expenses and profit margins.

X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION
See Section VI above.

XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED
Pending a change in Air Staff?s technical requirements, the integrated dental capability initiative to standardized 3-D capable dental equipment and CAD/CAM software across the Air Force, or another manufacturer of the CEREC brand name equipment, this office is limited in the ability to overcome the competition barrier.

XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION
The contracting officer?s signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he/she has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of his/her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY?S NEEDS
The CEREC Acquisition Unit is a CAD/CAM (computer-assisted design/computer-assisted machining) unit, is mobile, houses a medical grade computer and the CEREC camera.  Dentist uses the camera to take a digital picture of the prepared tooth.  This picture is used instead of a traditional impression.  The computer and CEREC three dimensional (3-D) software converts the digital picture to a 3-D virtual model of your prepped tooth.  The dentist then designs the restoration right on screen using the software while the patient waits.  This software assist  dentist with designing any single tooth restoration:  crowns, inlays (fillings), onlays (partial crowns), and veneers.  Once the dentist has designed the restoration (usually about 5 minutes), he or she clicks a button, and the design data is communicated via a wireless radio signal to the CEREC Milling Unit. This purchase request will include a 24-month warranty and hands on training to be conducted at Shaw AFB SC. This acquisition has an estimated delivery date of 60 days after award of contract. Price includes full system components, hardware, software, operating manuals, hands on training course at Shaw AFB, and any shipping charges. 

IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, ?Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement.?  

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 
A. United States Air Force?s (USAF) Dental Evaluation and Consultation Service study was conducted in 2004 to evaluate the operational efficiency of this unit and it the unit received an ?Excellent? rating for use in USAF facilities. I discussed this acquisition with Colonel Alan Sutton the Director of Peterson Area Dental Laboratory who is also the military consultant to the Surgeon General for Prosthodontics/Dental Laboratories. He stated Air Staff has determined it is essential that CAD/CAM equipment capabilities be standardized across the Air Force. Accordingly Colonel Sutton is instructing Air Force Bases to purchase CEREC name brand equipment and instructs units to consider going sole source directly to Sirona Dental Systems as most advantageous to the Government. It is mission essential that software systems are compatiable therfore, ensuring flow of information necessary to preform required tasks. 
B. Market research revealed that Sirona Dental Systems is the only manufacturer of the CEREC brand name equipment. They are committed to technological innovation, manufacturing excellence, and dedicated to creating and producing the finest dental equipment available. Their products represent cutting-edge of modern dental treatment, research, and development. An example of this can be seen in their inLab CAD/CAM dental systems which made Sirona the leader in the dental laboratory market.  
C. The 20th Contracting Squadron believes that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Air Force?s requirements.
Accordingly, Sirona Dental Systems is the only firm capable of providing the dental equipment described in Section III above without the Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.

VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE 
A. Market research conducted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBusOpps) revealed the following sources sought results.
1. Solicitation number FM480063560349 posted on 28 December 2007 by the 1st Contracting Squadron stated they were soliciting purchase of CEREC brand name dental equipment on a sole source basis and they intend to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order with Sirona Dental Systems. 
2. Solicitation number F4D4A16233A600 posted on 12 September 2006 by 30th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract with Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC brand name dental equipment.
3. Solicitation FM485262431204 posted 9 September 2006 by 99th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC brand name dental equipment.
4. Solicitation number VA-SNOTE-060130-001 posted 30 January 2006 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for various CEREC brand name dental equipment on behalf of 437th Medical Group, Charleston AFB SC.
B. Other Actions. Other brand name CAD/CAM dental equipment is available that can provide similar services/capabilities but cost two to three times more. The mandate from Air Staff stating it is essential CAD/CAM equipment capabilities be standardized across the Air Force precludes purchasing other brand name systems with similar capabilities. Market research has revealed similar CEREC brand name equipment has already been acquired by numerous other Air Force Bases to include; Peterson Area Dental Laboratory, Hickam AFB HI, Patrick AFB FL, Kadena and McConnell AFBs.  Peterson Area Dental Laboratory is the central-hub for dental procedure/support for Shaw AFB. See Section VIII for actions taken to facilitate competition for this acquisition. All other actions to locate other sources were unsuccessful

VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE 
A. The CEREC Acquisition Unit is part of a larger integrated dental capability initiative to standardized future 3-D capable dental equipment and CAD/CAM software across the Air Force per Air Staff directive. Discussions with Sirona Dental Systems revealed the following.  
1. The military is one of a few organizations that are allowed to purchase the system directly from the manufacturer (Sirona Dental Systems) thus saving thousands of dollars off the standard retail price if purchased through a distributor.
2. There are only a couple of dealers/wholesalers through which to purchase this CEREC dental systems.  Patterson Dental Supply is the exclusive dealer for CEREC type system in US and Canada. Individual distributors add on appropriate pricing to the manufacturer?s price to meet their individual expenses and profit margins.
B. The Contracting Officer has determined the anticipated cost of this equipment is considered fair and reasonable based on the unique Air Force wide hardware/software integration initiative and the information provided in this justification and approval document.  

VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED
As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.
A.  Market research discussions with Sirona Dental Systems revealed the following.  
1. The military is one of a few organizations that are allowed to purchase the system directly from the manufacturer.
2. Normally, if purchased from a distributor the training course enrollment fee and materials are included in the price but the organization must pay travel expenses to Brea California or Amherst NY. If purchased directly from manufacturer (Sirona) the manufacturer will conduct the training course at Shaw AFB, thus saving resources. 
B. I spoke with the contracting unit at Patrick AFB. Based on market research, they made the determination it was advantageous to the Government to purchase the CEREC brand name dental equipment directly from Sirona Dental Systems. 
C. I spoke with dental personnel at McConnell AFB. They provided the following comments:  
1. They have high praise for the CEREC acquisition unit 
2. The price paid by McConnell for the Acquisition unit was $39,985.00, 30. It was purchased through Veteran Administration. 
D. Market research conducted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBusOpps) revealed the following.
1. Solicitation number FM480063560349 posted on 28 December 2007 by the 1st Contracting Squadron stated they were soliciting purchase of CEREC brand name dental equipment on a sole source basis and they intend to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order with Sirona Dental Systems.
2. Solicitation number F4D4A16233A600 posted on 12 September 2006 by 30th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract with Sirona Dental Systems for CEREC brand name dental equipment. 
3. Solicitation FM485262431204 posted 9 September 2006 by 99th Contracting Squadron stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for the CEREC brand name dental equipment. 
4. Solicitation number VA-SNOTE-060130-001 posted 30 January 2006 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center stated they intend to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Sirona Dental Systems for various CEREC brand name dental equipment on behalf of 437th Medical Group, Charleston AFB SC.   

IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 
Sirona Dental Systems is the sole manufacturer of this CEREC brand name dental equipment. There are only a few dealers/wholesalers through which to purchase this system.  Patterson Dental Supply is the exclusive dealer for CEREC type system in U.S. and Canada. Individual distributors add on appropriate pricing to manufacturer?s price to meet their individual expenses and profit margins.

X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION
See Section VI above.

XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED
Pending a change in Air Staff?s technical requirements, the integrated dental capability initiative to standardized 3-D capable dental equipment and CAD/CAM software across the Air Force, or another manufacturer of the CEREC brand name equipment, this office is limited in the ability to overcome the competition barrier.

XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION

(v) The Food and Drug Administration intends to purchase a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS.  This instrument is a dynamic light scattering device with zeta potential, viscosity,titration attachments, which provide a robust sizing profile for nanoparticle suspensions. The instrument can also measure zeta potential (~surface charge) and stability of nanoparticle dispersions. It is critical to fully characterize before  testing for toxicity and adverse/therapeutic effects.  Measurements may be performed over a large concentration range, allowing for analysis of particles in the as formulated state. The Zetasizer combines backscattering technology (increasing the sensitivity range to 0.6 nm to 6 microns), zeta potential, viscosity measurements and titration capabilities.  The system consists of an instrument to measure the size, molecular weight and zeta potential of dispersed particles and molecules in solution, a viscometer package for continuous measurement of the viscosity of fluids (and increased accuracy in sizing measurements), a multi-purpose titrator for automated measurements of nanoparticle dispersions as a function of size, pH, conductivity, or contamination, and a commensurate operating system for processing.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811213 with a size standard of $5 million.

Shared Technologies is currently providing voice mail maintenance support to the GSA, however, the current task order ends on 09/30/2007.

GSA plans to award this open market contract on a sole source basis to Shared Technologies.  For the past five years, Shared Technologies has been an integral partner in providing voicemail maintenance services for the locations listed previously.

At the end of the period of performance, the Government will conduct further market research to determine if another responsible source has entered the commercial marketplace that would be able to perform these voicemail maintenance services.  If another responsible source is found at that time, then the next contract will be awarded on a competitive basis.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held. (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic  corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs. (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.           Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

SCOPE OF WORK

INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this contract is to collect available information on the characteristics of areas of concern, such as Natural Reserves around Puerto Rico, specifically benthic habitat, and impacts of non-fishing activities on these areas.  The information obtained will help in characterizing and selecting habitats for future monitoring of impacts of non-fishing activities.  The project will result in a compilation of historical information on the status of marine resources for areas identified as priorities for conservation by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER).  This project addresses some of the needs identified in the Local Action Strategy Overfishing Group priority project, ?Select, characterize and monitor those habitats essential for fishery resources that are being affected by non-fishing activities.?

BACKGROUND:
Non-fishing activities often result in negative impacts to the coral reef ecosystem, including associated fishing resources, around Puerto Rico, in particular due to the loss of benthic habitat.  Recreational activities that result in trampling of seagrasses and corals, cutting of mangrove roots and branches to create areas of shade or tie up boats; coastal development that results in erosion and sediment transport to the sea, clearing of mangroves, seagrasses, and other wetlands, and water quality changes; and boat groundings are some of the non-fishing activities that have been identified as impacting the coral reef ecosystem.  As part of Goal Number 4 of the Local Action Strategy Plan, Overfishing Theme, the Puerto Rico government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, is working to reduce the negative impacts on non-fishing activities to the coral reef ecosystem, including associated fishery resources.

This project is being initiated as a component of NMFS? efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to ?preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment.?

SCOPE:
Start date: Date of award 
End date: September 30, 2008 

In order to meet the objective of this contract the contractor shall complete the work in two distinct phases:  the compilation of historical information for priority areas, including reports, maps, and geographic data in electronic form; and final report detailing the methods used to collect the information, sources of information, and presenting tables with information on habitats in the areas, changes over time, and geographic references.  Short-term results will consist of the production of a detailed report with qualitative information on changes to important marine habitat areas over time.  Long-term results will consist of the identification of those systems and the activities that should be considered for monitoring and the implementation of management to protect marine resources.

The project operation must be conducted in order to carry out the technical tasks described in this document within the established timeframe.  The contractor must report any problems or complications that may arise during the realization of each task that could affect the time table.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  NASA Ames has a requirement for Diagnostic Ports for Arc Driven Shock Tubes. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for three types of instrumentation ports for the NASA Ames Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. Each port shall be a complete assembly that will attach directly to the test section of the driven portion of the shock tube.  Shock Tube Environment Specifications: The driven portion of the shock tube operates as both a vacuum and pressure vessel.  The base pressure of the driven tube is &lt; 5x10(to the -7th power) torr.  All components of the shock tube are rated to a maximum allowable pressure of 4.85 MPa (700 psia).  The shock tube is exposed to a variety of pure gases, gas mixtures, and their reaction products. These include the following: Air; N2; N2/CO2 mixture; CH4/N2 mixture; H2/He mixture. Reactive species from these gases are produced by the shock wave. Shock speeds up to 30 km/s have been achieved.  The shocked gases can reach temperatures approaching 15,000 K for brief durations (milliseconds) before heat dissipation.  Under normal operating conditions, the post-shock pressure can reach 200 kPa.  The electric arc driver of the shock tube also produces super-heated gases and vaporized solids that will reach the driven tube and test section following passage of the shock wave.  These include helium, argon, nitrogen, Teflon, tungsten, mylar, and aluminum alloys.  The diagnostic ports will be mounted to a 6061 aluminum alloy test section that is part of the driven tube.  The inner diameter of the shock tube is 4.0 (10.16 cm). Port materials: The metallic surfaces of the ports exposed to the interior of the shock tube shall be made of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. The vacuum/pressure sealing o-rings shall be perfluorinated elastomers (Parker Parofluor or equivalent). The window materials for the ports shall be 1) fused silica, for ultraviolet to infrared transmission and 2)either magnesium floride (MgF2) or lighium floride (LiF)for vacuum ultraviolet transmission. Port vacuum, pressure, and temperature performance: Vacuum pressure &lt; 10(to the -8th power) torr (1.33 x 10 (to the -6th power) Pa); Positive pressure (&gt; or = to) 4.85 MPa; Leak rate &lt; 10 (to the -8th power) atm cm(to the 3rd power)/s He; Bakeout temperature (&gt; or = to) 80 degrees C; Operating temperature (&gt; or = to) 25 degrees C. Requirements for this study are as follows:  Vacuum leak rate and static pressure testing to the above specifications is required for acceptance. Each complete port assembly shall be tested and documented. A description of the test apparatus is required. All machining shall be performed using tools and methods compatible with ultra high vacuum service. Port specifications applicable to all configurations are listed below: The port design shall have a primary insert body attached with fastening bolts to the shock tube test section. A secondary insert containing the relevant diagnostic hardware (window, fiber optic collimator, pressure transducer) shall be inserted into the primary insert body and attached with fastening bolts. The secondary inserts will be removed after every experiment for cleaning. The seals between 1) the primary insert and shock tube test section, and 2) secondary and primary inserts shall meet the pressure and vacuum specifications listed above. The inner surface of the inserts shall be conformal with cylindrical wall of the shock tube test section; the inserts shall not introduce protrusions or recesses in the shock tube wall. The radius of the conforming wall of the primary insert, defined by the circular shock tube cross section, shall be 2.0. The insertion depth shall be 1.750 as measured from the bottom of the primary insert flange to the apex of the conforming wall. The thickness of the primary insert flange shall be 0.5. All fasteners shall be 1/4 -28 screws. The primary insert shall have 316 stainless steel threaded inserts for the secondary fasteners. The ports shall have internal 120 VAC bakeout heaters where possible. All vacuum sealing surfaces shall be polished to a surface finish compatible with the above vacuum leak rate requirement. Two spare o-ring kits shall be provided for each complete port assembly. Detailed specifications of the port types are listed below:  Rectangular window port: Two (2) rectangular window ports are required. One shall have a fused silica window, and the other shall have either an MgF2 or LiF window.  The windows shall be mounted in the secondary insert with a retaining o-ring.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF SOLE SOURCE

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity:  The requiring activity is the Commander Navy Region Mid-Lant.  The contracting activity is the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk.

2.  Description of the Action Being Approved.  Award of a contract on a brand name basis for 44 Honda boat engines in support of Commander Navy Region Mid-Lant Port Operations. 

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.  Port Operations requires delivery of 22 standard rotation and 22 counter rotation 4-stroke 25 remote controlled, power trim and tile, electric start boat engines.  The 44 boat engines will be delivered to five locations as provided in the solicitation document.  The estimated value of this procurement is $408, 056.00, which includes a unit price of $9,274.00 each.  The funding provided is FY07 Operation and Maintenance Navy funds.  

4.  Statutory Authority Permitting SOLE SOURCE.  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 - a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a). 

5.  Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority.  The basis of the sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (see FAR 6.302-1).  Naval Station Norfolk currently has 19 Harbor Security Boats which use Honda Engine Model 130.  After inspection of the boat engines, it was determined repairs were needed.  Honda Marine advised Port Operations that Model 130 was obsolete and repair parts are no longer available.  In addition, Honda Marine stated Model 150 directly replaces Model 130.  Port Operations is unable to guarantee other engines/parts will interface properly with existing boats.  The Honda 150 engine replacements are free of any modification/adjustments for the boat engines to fit the boats and continue adequate performance.  If any other engine is purchase, modifications will be required in order for engines to fit and meet required performance standards and functionality.  Proper functioning of the boats is critical to the command?s mission.  Additionally, purchasing any other brand will require additional cost of purchasing equipment/tools to perform modifications as well as cost incurred in training Port Operations Repair Technicians to perform modifications.  

6.  Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable.  Market research has resulted in a determination that no other boat engine will meet the customers requirements.  The solicitation for Honda Engine Model 150 will be posted on NECO and FEDBIZOPS as an unrestricted procurement.  

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.  The Contracting Officer will determine the cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this J&A to be fair and reasonable prior to award.  

8.  Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.  For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, Port Operations is unable to identify actions that may remove barriers to future competition.  If another potential source emerges, FISC Norfolk with the assistance of Port Operations will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:
1. System must have a cluster of 4 discreet SDD elements with the performance specified in #2 below, combined in software for a composite spectrum.  The strategy of 4 detector elements seeks to minimize the peak coincidence effects by enabling each detector to operate at 25% the speed of the desired output count rate;

2. Each SDD detector element must be capable of performing with a resolution of 133 eV (full peak width at half peak intensity, FWHM at Mn K alpha, 5895 eV) or better with a peaking time constant that permits an output count rate (OCR) of  at least 100,000 counts per second (cps); The  peak width measured at FWHM at Mn K alpha must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent;

3.  The peak channel value must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent.  The energy channel width for the spectrum used for this stability test must have a width of 5 eV/channel or less.  Alternatively, the peak shape must be fit using a mathematical model (e.g. Gaussian, split Pearson, Voigt, 	functions), and the peak center must be constant within plus or minus 5 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent; 

4. Each SDD detector element must be capable of performing with an x-ray mapping resolution of 133 eV (FWHM at Mn K alpha, 5895 eV) or better with a peaking time constant that permits an OCR of 250,000 cps or higher for each chip.  The peak width measured at MnK alpha must be constant within plus or minus 10 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent.  The peak channel value must be constant within plus or minus 10 eV up to a deadtime of 60 percent. 

5.  The hardware and software systems must be capable of both recording the output of  each individual detector or combining the output of all four detectors into a composite spectrum, selectable by the user.  The composite spectrum of all four 
detectors must  have a resolution of 133 eV or better with a total OCR of 1,000,000 cps or higher.

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT
Software must be flexible and adaptable to export formats for raw, unprocessed x-ray spectrum image data.  Compatibility and interoperability with NIST?s existing analysis software is required.  Specifically:

(a) Complete disclosure and documentation of the native spectrum and spectrum image file format of the software.  This will permit NIST to develop software to read and write these formats;

(b) Alternatively, it must be possible to export the x-ray spectrum image file as a brick of bytes or raw file format which will consist of a continuous string of numbers, no header, no compression, no encoding to eliminate blocks of zeros, etc., spectrum by spectrum, row by row of the x-y scan.  All of the numbers are in the same format, such as 16 bit signed 
integer, IEEE 8-byte real, 8-bit unsigned byte, etc.   The raw file will be accompanied by a text file with the same name and .rpl extension.  This is a NIST Lispix file that lists the characteristics of the raw file so that it can be loaded without human intervention. There are eight parameters, listed in the table below.  CAPITAL LETTERS indicates the options for a 
parameter, rather than a description of the parameter. The order of the parameters in the .rpl file is important.
	 Name        Description                
      	Width        number pixels per row       integer   
        Height       number rows                 integer
     	Depth        number images or spec pts   integer 
      	offset       number bytes to skip asterisk  integer
      	Data-type    SIGNED, UNSIGNED or FLOAT   
      	data-length  number bytes per pixel      1, 2, 4, or 8
      	Byte-Order   BIG-ENDIAN, LITTLE_ENDIAN, or DON?T CARE	
	Record-by    IMAGE, VECTOR, or DON?T-CARE        
					
	This is an example RPL file.  There are eight rows (lines) in the file, with two words or numbers per line, 
separated by a tab and any number of spaces.
	key		value
	width	       128   
	height	       96    
	depth	       101   
	offset	       0     
	data-length    2     
	data-type	signed      
	byte-order	little-endian     
	record-by	image

<DESC>INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) CONTRACT MULTI-DISCIPLINED A-E SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY (MDA) AND OTHER U.S. MILITARY PROJECTS ANNOUNCEMENT: W912GB-07-R-0028 AMENDMENT 0001 The purpose of this amendment 0001 to the original announcement W912GB-07-R-0028 is to respond to questions received to date.  In addition, the due date for submissions is extended from 24 August 2007 to 30 August 2007 no later than 1600 Central European T ime (Summer). Project:  Multi-disciplined A-E services are required from initial site investigation through engineering support services during construction for various U.S. military projects primarily within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Europe District Area of Res ponsibility (AOR), but may also include projects anywhere in USEUCOM or other locations in which U.S. Forces Europe have a mission.  Question:  1) One additional question on Announcement W912GB 07 R 0028  MDA.  Under Criterion B. Professional Qualifications, the Key Discipline Project Manager is followed by (Architect/Engineer).  Is this meant to limit all project managers on this anno uncement to those that are Architects or Engineers? Answer:    1) The intent of the words (Architect/Engineer) was to make sure that the person called Project Manager was a professional (degreed), experienced individual.  Note that the word engineer includes environmental engineers, geologists, hydrogeologi sts, etc. Question: 2) The subject announcement requires offerors to include ALL recent ACASS evaluations (past three (3) years) in Section H of the SF 330 submittal.  We have received more than 200 evaluations for the required 3-year period, which will be a substan tial volume of material to include in Section H.  Do you really want all evaluations, or perhaps a summary table of the ratings? Answer:  2) We want a summary only.  We do NOT require the actual evaluations.   Question:  3) From the FBO announcement, it is unclear what the general percentage of work on this contract will be for the broad categories of (a) construction oversight services, (b) environmental support services, and (c) facility design services.  Can you provide any breakdown on the expected dollar composition of these (or any additional areas) on this announcement?  Answer:  3) No specific breakdown of the anticipated services is known at this time. Question:  4) Even though Europe, the USEUCOM AOR, Japan, the NATO AOR, and Arabian Gulf regions are mentioned, can you provide any additional information about where most of the work will occur?  Answer:  4) You are misreading the announcement. This is a sentence taken directly from the A-E section of the Federal Acquiaition Regulations.  Japan, NATO AOR and Arabian Gulf Regions are stated after the sentence - Some Task Orders may mandate that the required services be accomplished by a U.S. firm or joint venture (i.e&for example)  It is anticipated that most of the work will occur in Europe, but may occur in other locations where U.S. Forces Europe have a mission.     Question:  5) The announcement states that some task orders may mandate that the required services be accomplished by a US firm or joint venture and also states that non-US firms that submit qualification statements must demonstrate that they have a teamin g arrangement with a U.S. firm that would satisfy this requirement.  Please verify that joint venture prime contractor arrangement that consists of a U.S. firm and a foreign firm will satisfy this requirement, as long as the JV can demonstrate that the U.S . firm will be the only entity that accomplishes these special task orders that require US-only preparation. Answer:  5) It is intended that all teams submitting have either a US/Host Nation joint venture arrangement or a US prime. Question:  6) Because this work will be accomplished for the Missile Defense Agency by the Europe District, are there any specific requirements for the offerors to  document compliance and approvals with regulations from the Bureau of Industry and Security from the U.S. Department of Commerce for export compliance?  Answer:  6) There are no specific export compliance requirements, but offerers must comply with Federal statutes and mandates that apply.    Question:  7) The FBO announcement addresses that some of the services required may be topographical mapping services.  This is a very broad term.  Could you clarify whether this denotes the creation of maps from no data or the manipulation of existing top ographic or GIS data?  Answer:  7) The requirement for topographic mapping services may include either new data or manipulation of existing data in GIS. Question:  8) The FBO announcement addresses that some of the services required may be environmental documentation.  This is also very broad term.  We are assuming that this refers to a broad range of environmental services such as pollution prevention pla ns, potential NEPA documentation, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, etc.  Please verify and/or clarify.  Answer:  8) The environmental work anticipated is of a standard associated with the kind of construction expected.  This would include such things as soils testing, environmental assessments, pollution prevention plans and so forth.  Nothing extraordinary is expected in the response to this announcement.   Question:   9) The FBO announcement addresses that some of the services required may be programmatic support services.  We are assuming that this refers to all the activities that determine the scope, cost, and priority of future construction work in suppo rt of the Missile Defense Agency.  Please verify and/or clarify.  Answer:  9) The assumption made by the offeror is correct. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Firms that have the capability to perform this work are invited to submit one (1) hard copy of Standard Form 330 to include the prime firm, consultants, subcontractors, and joint ventures to the address below not later than 1600 C entral Daylight European Time on the 30th August 2007.

STATEMENT OF WORK


PART I.  GENERAL INFORMATION

A.  INTRODUCTION

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), seeks the services of qualified individuals/firms to provide planning services for Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plans (CNMPs) in Alabama.  

The primary goal of a CNMP is to minimize the potential for ground and surface water pollution from manure handling facilities and land application of manure.  The CNMP addresses manure and wastewater storage and handling facilities, nutrient management and land application practices, runoff and erosion control practices, animal mortality plans, preventative maintenance plan, emergency response plans, and record keeping.

The CNMPs shall be developed following procedures described in this statement of work.  These procedures were derived from the National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH). The contractor shall work with individual livestock/poultry producers to develop the CNMP plan using a staged, multiyear approach.  

Progress made by a producer toward preparing and fully implementing a CNMP ? including the investment in facilities, the gathering of information, the management of manure and land application of nutrients, improving skills, and the training of employees ? take place over a period of years.  

B.  SCOPE

1.	The work covered by this contract shall consist of the performance of all operations described below in PART II, WORK REQUIREMENTS, necessary to develop CNMPs.

PART II.  WORK REQUIREMENTS

A.  PLANNING 

1.	NOTE: A Comprehensive Nutrient Management Plan (CNMP) should address all   land units that the animal feeding operation (AFO) owner and/or operator owns or has decision-making authority over and on which manure and organic by-products will be generated, handled, stored, or applied. 

2.	NOTE: NRCS policy requires that technical assistance provided for conservation planning follow the guidance and processes in the NRCS National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH). For the purposes of providing conservation planning technical assistance, Technical Service Providers are to complete the actions required in the first seven Steps of the NPPH planning process. All deliverables below are based on that requirement. For detailed guidance, planners should refer to the appropriate section of the NRCS NPPH (CNMP Technical Guidance) http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov/scripts/lpsiis.dll/H/H_180_600_E_5.htm. 
B.  DELIVERABLES 
A completed, certified CNMP in accordance with Alabama NRCS General Manual Title 180, Part 409 Conservation Planning Policy shall be developed and include the following: 
1. Document the AFO owner?s/operator?s consideration of the six CNMP elements. It is recognized that a CNMP may not contain all six elements; however, they need to be considered by the AFO owner/operator during development of the CNMP, and the owner's and/or operator's decisions regarding each must be documented. These elements are as follows: 
	a. Manure and Wastewater Handling and Storage 
	b. Land Treatment Practices 
	c. Nutrient Management 
	d. Record Keeping 
	e. Feed Management 
	f. Other Utilization Activities 
	
NOTE: The degree to which each CNMP element is addressed is determined by the General Criteria and must meet the specific criteria provided for each element in the National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH), Sections 600.53 and 600.54 available at http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov/scripts/lpsiis.dll/H/H_180_600_E_5.htm . 

2. CNMPs will contain actions that address water quality criteria for the feedlot, production area, and land on which the manure and organic by-products will be applied (i.e., as a minimum the plan would address CNMP elements a, b, c, and d listed in item 1 above). This includes addressing soil erosion to reduce the transport of nutrients within or off of a field to which manure is applied. For AFO owners and/or operators who do not land apply any manure or organic by-products, the CNMP would address only the feedlot and production areas (i.e., address CNMP elements a, d, and f listed in item 1 above). 

3. Document that the CNMP meets all applicable local, Tribal, State, and Federal laws and regulations. When applicable, ensure that USEPA-NPDES or State permit requirements (i.e., minimum standards and special conditions) are addressed. The Alabama Department of Environment Management (ADEM) requires that permitted CAFOs meet the requirements of Chapter 1200-4-5 Permits, Effluent Limitations and Standards. This rule is available at http://www.state.tn.us/environment/wpc/publications/. 

4. Format and Content of CNMP ? the Manure Manager Program (MMP) or Alabama?s Phosphorous Index and Nutrient Management Spreadsheets will be used to develop manure and commercial fertilizer allocation decisions in compliance with the NRCS?s 590 Standard, which requires the documentation of form, source, timing, method, and placement of nutrients. MMP is a standalone nutrient management planning tool, with optional connections to GIS (ArcView using either AFOPro Spatial or Spatial Nutrient Management Planner as the front end) and the NRCS?s Animal Waste Management (v 2.1 or higher) engineering software. Once the required information is entered in AFOPro, the application automates and populates the Tennessee NRCS CNMP approved template. Additionally, AFOPro automates the Phosphorus Index and contains state-specific fertility recommendations. http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/awm/. ArcView GIS or equivalent will be used to develop maps in the CNMP. 

5. Certify that the CNMP meets requirements of the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) conservation practice standards for all practices contained within it. 

6. Provide documentation in the CNMP that addresses the following items: 
a. Site information 
i. Names, phone numbers, and addresses of the AFO owner(s) and operator(s).

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 002 TO THE	COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR INTERPRETING SERVICES.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: Q: Although total number of weekly hours is dynamic, in order to ensure availability of two primary interpreters, there must be a minimum number of hours per week guaranteed (excepting weeks of Deaf staff vacations or holidays). What is the minimum number of weekly hours guaranteed on this contract? A: 24 hours per week is the lowest we can practically go but this is not a guarantee that this is the lowest number.  40 hours a week is not the average number of hours per week either.  The average number of hours per week would be closer to 32. Q:   Please provide an estimated percentage of each type of meeting listed as to the frequency of interpreting for that category over the course of the contract: A:   I do not have specific numbers to this kind of question.  The bulk of the requests are regularly scheduled meetings, and impromptu meetings. Q:   How many hours of training will the two primary interpreters be expected to attend in order to carry out their functions effectively? A: Roughly 5 hours per year, in addition to however many hours that the RID requires for continuing education to maintain certification in good standing. Q :  Will all the necessary training be provided up front or done as needed, i.e. for clean rooms just prior to interpreting in that space is needed. A:  As-needed, with sufficient advance notice. Q: Will required training of interpreters will be charged at the agreed upon interpreting rates? A: Yes. Q: How often do classified meetings require an interpreter present? A: Cannot answer, no one has requested an interpreter to discuss classified material. Q:  For reviews, how often is a Deaf employee a presenter? A: Often; some sign, some voice. Q:  Will prep time be allotted in the schedule for the interpreter to work with the Deaf presenter? A: Yes Q:  Will all pertinent information regarding reviews (or other types of meetings) be provided to the interpreter(s) as it is available at the time the request for the interpreter is made? A: Yes Q: How many Deaf employees are on staff? A: 4 Q: What are the job titles of Deaf employees/consumers currently on staff? A: Computer Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Software Engineer, and Propulsion Engineer. Q: What are the communication preferences of Deaf staff? A: American Sign Language (ASL), Pidgin Signed English (PSE) Q: Does any Deaf staff utilize SEE? A: No Q: Please define evaluation tools provided to consumers for regular monitoring of interpreting services. A: Whatever the vendor chooses to implement for quality control purposes.  This mechanism will be evaluated in your proposal as to whether it is an effective mechanism for assessing and improving quality. Q: On what criteria are interpreters evaluated? A: Clarity of spoken english to sign, clarity of sign to spoken english, level of professionalism, and for primary interpreters, their administrative capability. Q: Please explain the 4 week initial assessment period.  Does this occur once the contract has been awarded? A: The 4 week assessment applies to whenever a new primary interpreter is assigned. Q: If there is a problem with an interpreter during the assessment period, does the contractor have the right to replace said interpreter and continue with the contract or will the contract be revoked after 4 weeks? A: Yes. the interpreter can be replaced with someone more suitable.  The contract is not automatically revoked after 4 weeks. Q: How frequently do short notice or impromptu meetings occur? A: Impromptu meetings are meetings that occur on an non-regular basis, but is known in advance.  Short notice is an impromptu meeting, with less than 48 hours of notice.  No data exists on the frequency of either but they do happen. Q:  How frequently do interpreted media events occur? A: Sometimes. Q: Is a rate differential allowed for short notice/impromptu meetings and media events? A: A differential rate is allowed for short notice, but not for impromptu and media events.
