Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNH-F6-010003-B, Refreshed #1 (include the dashes). 

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSAAdvantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSAAdvantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).  All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts with $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation, and is a request for proposals (RFP). The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to competitively award a contract to assist in the continuing development of a top-tier professional organization within MMS responsible for managing activities associated with commodity sales and/or exchanges of royalty crude oil and natural gas. Contract work includes assessments of and recommendations on operational and technical issues and development of a 5-year Business Plan. The program of interest is MMS' royalty in kind (RIK) program, in which oil and gas production royalties are taken in kind as physical commodities delivered to the federal government by producers, as distinct from the historically prevalent payment of royalties by producers in cash. MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE STRUCTURE. The mission of MMS is managing the mineral resources on the outer continental shelf in an environmentally sound manner and to timely collect, verify, and distribute mineral revenues from Federal and Indian lands. The organizational components of MMS are described as follows. Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) provides management, policy, and direction for all minerals revenue management processes to ensure the efficient, timely, and accurate collection and disbursement of mineral leasing revenue due to American Indian Trust Tribes, individual Indian lessors, States, and the U.S. Treasury. The RIK program is currently administered by MRM. Administration and Budget (A&B) provides management, policy, and direction of the information technology, personnel, procurement, administrative support, budgetary, and financial management processes to support the bureau's program offices and other federal activities. A&B provides contracting, budgetary, and financial management support to the RIK program. Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) provides management, policy, and direction for all offshore oil, gas, and mineral lease, production, and inspection activities to ensure an effective economic return and a safe environment that balances the interests of the nation's economic welfare and a partnership with the industry. OMM provides data access and verification support to the RIK program. Policy and Management Improvement (PMI) provides policy review, special studies, and coordinated program and policy positions for the Director; manages the strategic planning process; oversees the regulatory and information collection programs; provides policy analysis; and manages the MMS appeals process. PMI provides analytic support for the RIK program. DESCRIPTION OF SUBJECT MATTER ISSUES. The MMS has managed energy commodity sales "pilot" programs for 3 years, and a Small Refiner Program for several decades. Commercial projects include oil sales from Wyoming production (4,000 barrels/day); gas sales from Gulf of Mexico offshore production (380,000 MMBtu/day); and oil sales to small refiners from Gulf of Mexico and Pacific offshore production (55,000 barrels/day). In addition, MMS and DOE manage the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fill initiative through exchange agreements involving up to 130,000 barrels/day of Gulf of Mexico royalty oil. Some 1,100 Federal oil and gas leases are involved, with RIK commodities valued at well over $1 billion annually.  The current primary RIK organization, the RIK Program Office, is headquartered in MRM's Lakewood Colorado office, with a Senior Executive Service Assistant Program Director reporting to the Washington, D.C. based Associate Director for MRM, and managing approximately 34 employees. The RIK Program Office performs the front office and mid office functions of the RIK program. The back office functions are performed by the Onshore and Offshore Compliance and Asset Management offices in Lakewood, CO, Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA. Financial accounting for RIK business activities is provided by MRM's Financial Management organization located in Lakewood, CO. Contractors are not currently used for operational functions, although Accenture LLP provides system-related development and support.   The RIK Program Office has responsibility and accountability for the RIK enterprise, including selection and conversion of RIK properties, marketing and sales, contracting, crude oil and natural gas volume control, invoicing and payment, payables management, performance evaluation, and management reporting. Payments are integrated with and flow through the overall MRM financial management system. Reconciliation of volumes taken to those entitled to be taken is performed by the compliance offices, which also monitor payment compliance with contract terms. The MRM RIK Office has successfully built the new RIK business enterprise and has expanded the RIK portfolio.  Roles are functionally aligned with proven industry best practices.  RIK personnel identify and evaluate business cases, perform economic analyses, conduct competitive sales, schedule product deliveries, and verify receipts.  Business processes have been implemented and assigned personnel are effectively performing commercial commodity sales activities.  Based on the RIK pilot programs' success, MMS concluded in its January 2001 RIK Road Map to the Future that RIK will be a permanent method to use, along with the traditional cash royalty approach, to manage the public's mineral royalty asset stream.  The Road Map set forth the strategic direction and specific actions to develop core business processes, organization, and supporting technology to move the RIK program from pilot to operational status by the end of 2003. However, the strategic direction and implementation actions provided by the Road Map do not extend beyond 2003.   Moreover, a recent internal MMS RIK needs assessment concluded that additional capabilities and resources will be needed to support a permanent RIK program of significant scale and that some operational areas may need to be outsourced.  The needs assessment also concluded that technical assistance is needed for optimizing the RIK business model and associated strategies.  Based on the foregoing, MMS believes it is timely and desirable to obtain expert advice on how to improve and expand the permanent RIK program. MMS is also proposing the development of a 5-year Business Plan to guide the administration and expansion of the Federal RIK Program in the future.  EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF THE CONTRACT.   An independent assessment of current RIK program capabilities and performance, recommendations to improve overall program performance, and development of a 5-year RIK Business Plan. Specific deliverables follow: 1.	Assess the current capabilities and performance of the Federal RIK Program and provide recommendations for improvement. a.	Evaluate effectiveness of the current RIK business model and         operational processes and recommend areas for improvement. b.	Identify RIK functions with high potential for outsourcing.  c.	Recommend internal control process improvements, including RIK performance measurement tools and metrics. d.	Recommend strategies to optimize revenue receipts from the Federal portfolio of royalty assets, including processes and support tools. e.	Recommend strategies to acquire transportation and processing services.  f.	Recommend alternative approaches for the aggregation, marketing, and delivery of RIK sales volumes. 2.	  Develop RIK Business Plan for the future. a.	Provide detailed strategic plan to guide the administration and       expansion of the Federal RIK Program for the period 2004-2008.    b.	Provide actions, timelines, and milestones to achieve RIK expansion  goals -190,000 barrels/day of OCS oil and 1.5 bcf/day of OCS gas.  c.	Recommend strategies for expanding the Federal oil and gas RIK property portfolio, including onshore producing properties. d.	Provide recommendations on the RIK property portfolio, operational processes, organizational structures, and human resources to effectively support the permanent Federal RIK Program. 3.	  Briefings, progress reviews, and final reports. a.	Senior Executive briefings will be conducted at the beginning and end         of the contract or more frequently as requested. b.	Contractor will provide monthly status reports. c.   Contractor will provide draft reports for review and concurrence by       MMS management. Final reports to be in print and electronic format.    CONTRACT TYPE/DESCRIPTION. The total estimated value of this effort (not including ad hoc continuing task orders after the Business Plan completion) is between $300,000-$500,000. The anticipated contract type is a firm-fixed price contract for the Independent Assessment and Business Plan. The performance period for both tasks is 12 months or less. Ad hoc task orders will be issued to implement the Business Plan. These will be priced on a time-and-materials basis. The total period of performance inclusive of all ad hoc task orders shall be 24 months or less. For the fixed-price portion of the work (Independent Assessment and Business Plan), payment will be 50% of the contract cost based on incremental completion of milestones. The remaining 50% of the cost will be paid upon acceptance of the final deliverable for both tasks. The acceptance and payment of the incremental completion costs will not preclude the government from rejecting the project on conclusion if it determines the project has not met expectations. The following criteria will be applied when determining acceptance of the project deliverables: 	Independent assessment report and related deliverables that respond to specific direction,   (1) are understood by MMS executive, contracting and RIK management, (2) specifically address current RIK capabilities and performance, (3) include recommendations that demonstrate how each strategy, tool or alternative business approach presented or provided will result in improvements to the RIK program. 	A comprehensive 5-year Business Plan that: 1) can be implemented; 2) considers all technical, organizational, resource, regulatory, and economic issues related to energy commodity sales by a federal government entity; and 3) is highly likely to be accepted by stakeholders to the federal royalty program. HOW TO RESPOND.  An interested party must demonstrate that your organization is qualified to perform work by providing a Capabilities Statement detailing: 	Key staff that will work on the contract (those contractor employees that will have primary responsibility for performing/managing the work), with associated knowledge of and experience with MMS and energy sales issues. 	Organizational experience and facilities, including working knowledge of energy commodity sales, federal oil and gas valuation, and RIK programs, and ability to combine the above experience to provide external insights, perspectives, analysis, and solutions independent from those used in developing the current program 	Potential for conflict of interest, including affiliated relationships with federal lessees and current/planned business activity in performing energy commodity sales or accounting activities for sellers/buyers of energy commodities. 	Past performance, including specific references for similar work that your firm has successfully performed within the last 3 years. Include number, size, and complexity of similar projects, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, acceptability of delivered products, and client information with a point of contact and phone number that is current. All references will be checked. An original plus five (5) copies of the Capability Statement are due November 22, 2002, by 4 PM ET to Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, Mail Stop 2510, Second Floor, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA, 20170-4817.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management (OA&MM) in partnership with the Austin Automation Center (AAC), operating under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), Public Law 103-356, dated 23 Oct 94, as an Enterprise Fund, is preparing to release Phase I of a Two-Phased solicitation for the Global Information Technology Support Services (GITSS) acquisition.  The goal of this acquisition is to establish flexible, quick reaction contract vehicles to satisfy any information technology and telecommunication service needs for VA customers as well as other Federal Agencies.  Work may be performed in contractor=92s facilities or at Government sites anywhere in the world, depending on the customer=92s requirements.  We expect a great deal of contractor teaming to be required to cover the broad and complex scope, geographic requirements, and potential dollar value of the contracts.  Background information is available on the GITSS our acquisition website.  PLEASE NOTE, OUR WEBSITE ADDRESS HAS CHANGED; NEW WEBSITE ADDRESS IS: www.va.gov/oa&mm/busopps/gitss/.  Up to ten (10) Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) contract awards are anticipated from this single solicitation process.  Orders under these contracts may be issued on a fixed-price, time=96and-materials, or labor-hour basis.  Of the 10 possible contract awards, three (3) will be set-aside for small business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 517110 (Size Standard of 1,500 employees) shall apply.  NAICS code 513310 recently changed to 517110.=20 Each contract will have a minimum amount of $2,000 and a ceiling of $2,999,982,000.  The maximum dollar of all work that will be ordered against all 10 contracts will be $3 billion over 84 months.  The contracts will allow for an additional 12 months for final performance of work ordered for a total contract life of 96 months.  Contracts will be awarded at the end of a two-phased solicitation process.  Phase I will request =93Qualification Statements=94 from industry that we will use to evaluate the viability of potential offerors to participate in the Phase II best value source selection.  All firms that submit a Qualification Statement during Phase I will be notified of the Government=92s assessment of their viability to compete in the Phase II source selection.  Regardless of whether this notification invites an offeror to participate in the Phase II source selection, or advises them that they are not considered a viable competitor, all firms that submit a Qualification Statement within the required Phase I timeframe may submit a proposal during Phase II.    However, an offeror must submit a Qualification Statement during Phase I to be able to compete in Phase II of the process.  The source selection procedures delineated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 will be used to select contractors for award during Phase II.  The Request for Qualification Statements will be issued/published on the above mentioned website approximately 29 Nov 02 under Final Solicitation Documents.  =20 Interested firms may download our Request for Qualification Statements and respond to the specific requirements within the timeframe stated in that document.  No other solicitation related announcements are planned for this acquisition.

Solicitation No. DTRS57-03-Q-80014 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).   This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-09.  The NAICS Code is 541511 and the Small Business size standard is $18.0M.

The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order a nd to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with OAG Worldwide, Inc., Downers Grove, IL, to provide standard subscriptions services described below.  The Volpe Center has a requirement for domestic and international airline schedule data as part of the Volpe National Transportation Systems Centers (Volpe Center) Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) project, in support of the FAA.  The ETMS relies on this data to allow the Air Traffic Control System command Center (ATCSCC) to effectively and safely manage the nations airports and airspace.  Current and accurate flight information is used in ETMS to balance aircraft capacity and demand for airports and airway fixes, and is used by ATCSCC specialists to predict traffic problems and to avoid delays by implementing national traffic  management initiatives.  The services required demand that ETMS have continuous and reliable flight schedule data.  The Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services to provide the following standard subscription services, (1) WEEKLY BULK DATA TRANSMISSIONS  the Contractor shall provide for a full flight schedule to be made available weekly on a day and time to be coordinated with the Volpe Center.

If there is no discontinue date the date reverts to the last date of data.  There are to be no assumptions.  2. Provide a carrier code in the carrier code field  when there is no match in the FAA carrier code table.  This change will give the FAA more flexibility in determining which carriers are missing from the FAA carrier code table.  3.  Provide for the deletion of multiple flight records.  Since the flight data is primarily a marketing tool, the schedule information contained in the scheduled flight data may reflect a slightly different set of flights from what is actually flown during the applicable time period.  4.  Provide all flight leg segments for flights worldwide.  5.  Provide all segments of scheduled flight records.  There will be times a carrier will fly from a U.S. airport to an international airport with a non-ticket-selling stop at another U.S. airport.  The second segment of this flight should be included.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a sole source Request for Offer (RFO) for services to include but not limited to the following: fact finding, feasibility assessments and generation of strategic options that will lead to a final draft Implementation Plan for a Future Solutions Network. NASA/SSC intends to purchase the services from Innovative Strategic Advanced Systems on a non-competitive basis under the authority of 10 U. S. C. 2304 (c) (1), as only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will meet the agency requirements.  Award to any other contractor would likely result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements. NASA/SSC's requirement is to formulate a co-operative and sustainable relationship with SSC resident agencies for a solutions network. Initially, the activities will focus on available assets and skills that SSC organizations can bring to bear on decision support systems. Anchor agencies for the pilot of this solutions network are NASA and Department of the Navy. As envisioned, the proposed solutions network's function would include the following capabilities: 1.   Either host or simulate decision support system for parametric studies on the utility of Earth Science data to improve or enhance the information outputs used by the owners to make decisions. 2.      Demonstrate and optimize the access to earth science data used for input to the decision support system under evaluation. 3.    Verify data quality and validate data performance that is used by the decision support system. 4.       Provide solution network access for decision support system owners to run an earth science based version of their decision support system in parallel with their normal operational decision support system for operational validation and transition. 5.	    Provide support training for decision support system owners in the use of the earth science based version of the decision support system. The contractor shall perform the following tasks resulting in information that can be used by NASA to refine and further develop the solution network concept. a.     Develop a process to organize necessary Federal agency, industry, and academic experts to meet, review and make recommendations to NASA for the network's functionality. b.	 Host meetings with key experts to identify a strategic architecture to characterize the solution network's functionality. c.	 Formulate a Planning/Implementation team and host meetings to generate draft resources plans for communications networks, computing capability, workforce skills and available assets from the Navy and NASA. d.        The contractor shall plan to conduct this effort at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.  NASA shall provide suitable office space equipped with telephone, computer and network connections. This information is provided to assist the contractor in preparing all costs. The period of performance shall be the date of contract award and continue through April 30, 2003. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement is 541519 and $18.0 Million, respectively.	Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on November 15, 2002.   Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". No solicitation document exists and requests for such an unavailable document will not accepted. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

The contractor will maximize the use of state-of-the-art, Non-Developmental Items (NDI) hardware for the prime mission equipment, while providing highly reliable and easily maintainable radar that meets all applicable SRD requirements.  The radar equipment will be fully integrated into the existing Peace Shield System, and the radar performance will be verified in accordance with the test methods specified in the SRD.  The hardware and software design will be open architecture to allow replacement of any obsolete hardware without the redesign of the software or hardware not affected by the change.

The license at a minimum shall
provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).

Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.  The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>12202002
<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO A PREVIOUS ANNOUNCMENT. The due date for responses is now extended from November 12, 2002, to November 18, 2002, in order to allow offerors time to read the questions and responses below. Question 1 - The solicitation states "This contract initially for $250,000 is envisioned to continue for the duration of the historical accounting project described above." Does this mean that $250,000 is for the life of the contract? ANSWER: Yes. The $250,000 represents the total amount. If we award more than one contract, each one will be worth approximately $250,000. Question 2 - Would the Government clarify the statement identified in the OHTA Report to Congress on IIM historical accounting regarding the anticipated length of the contract for at least ten years? ANSWER: The entire historical accounting is anticipated to take 10 years. The effort described in this solicitation is only estimated to take 3 years. As work progresses, we will decide if additional efforts are necessary. Question 3 - Does OHTA have a goal for the number of reservation histories are to be accomplished in the base year and Option years? ANSWER: No.  Question 4 - Does OHTA have a sense for the magnitude of the documentation identification and collection? ANSWER: Yes. Based on institutional knowledge of staff and previously gathered statistics we have an estimate, but it is not firm enough to define a level of effort.  Question 5 - Can OHTA provide a list or description of the types of materials, data, documentation, etc. related to this contract that has been developed under other contracts related to the Blueprint? ANSWER: We do not have a comprehensive list. The types of documents can include judgments, oil and gas leases, interest distributions, etc.   Question 6 - Is there an incumbent currently performing this effort for OHTA? ANSWER: Yes. Historical Research Associates and Morgan Angel performed the initial effort for OHTA. Question 7 - Is there a preferred vendor? ANSWER: No. Question 8 - What concept has OHTA intended to implement for multiple awards?  How would the OHTA divide the projects among awardees? ANSWER: We will award contracts based on the strengths and abilities demonstrated by the offerors. Until we see the pool of qualified vendors, we will not make a decision about whether to award one or several contracts or how to divide the work. There is no pre-conceived plan.  Question 9 - Several of the tasks are not fully defined, especially in terms of the deliverable.  Can OHTA describe what, in general, they expect to achieve over the base year and two option years? ANSWER: The specific research efforts will be further defined through subsequent task orders, but the scope and breadth of the work is uncertain due to the nature of the project. Much of the work requirement will be dictated by factors that are now unknown such as the course of pending litigation.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to Solicitation COW-1-R-10066 is to answer the questions submitted by offerors by the deadline. 

The following contains the government's answers to questions submitted by the offerors to date.

QUESTION: Will the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) provide the publications/documents on the list provided in the solicitation?

ANSWER: No.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service will not provide the publications/documents on the list provided in the solicitation.  There are only two documents on the list that can be requested from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Office of the General Counsel, Asylum Division.  

QUESTION: Is it assumed that all offerors must be small business? 

ANSWER: No.  Section iv of the solicitation clearly provides the information. (iv) All potential offerors shall submit quotations for all of the service areas specified in Section v of this solicitation.  The government will consider all offers on an unrestricted basis.  If a minimum of two offers from qualified small business concerns are not received, the award for the area specified in Section v will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible business concerns submitting offers.

QUESTION: Will the CD-ROMs be networked?  If so, how many user stations will be accessing each CD?

ANSWER: The CD-ROMs must be suitable for network installation and must be multi-user capable.  Roughly 10 user stations per CD are approximated.  

QUESTION: Can you give us an approximate date for the contract award?

ANSWER: The approximate date for the contract award is on or about September 27, 2001.

Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified in the solicitation or as amended, by one of the following methods:
(a) By acknowledging receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted, or (b) By separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the solicitation and amendment numbers.  FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS PRIOR TO THE HOUR AND DATA SPECIFIED MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER.  If by virtue of this amendment you desire to change an offer already submitted, such change may be made by telegram or letter, provided each telegram or letter makes reference to the solicitation and this amendment, and is received prior to the opening hour and data specified.  

THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING WRITTEN QUOTES REMAINS UNCHANGED.

In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

        1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.

        NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

     jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address,    
     phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally 
     authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A 
     general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such 
     licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the 
     information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business 
     license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by 
     calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU 
     documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the 
     individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the 
     documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either 
     previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in 
     paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.   Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.   Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract
and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall
provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The Pharmaceutical Resources Branch (PRB), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking to develop and produce pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral dosage forms of promising new agents with activity against cancer. Certain agents selected by the NCI, DCTD, Cancer Operating Committees will be assigned for development and production as parenteral products (primarily sterile freeze dried products).  Batch sizes will range from small development batches (less than 500) to intermediate size batches to be used in Phase I and II trials; however, escalation to large batch size for Phase III trials is possible.  The capability to develop and manufacture other pharmaceutical dosage forms (i.e., large volume parenteral, sterile emulsions, sterile micro-dispersions, liposomes, etc) is desirable but not essential.  Data obtained from the contract(s) will: 1) be used to support IND applications submitted by the National Cancer Institute to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2) be provided to other NCI contractors engaged in large scale dosage form manufacture and analytical evaluation of these dosage forms, and 3) be provided to physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other medical personnel handling these products in a clinical setting. An offeror  must meet the following Mandatory Qualification Criteria at the time of proposal submission, in order for the proposal to be considered any further for award: The Contractor must be registered with the FDA as a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility for sterile products. The Contractor should show proof (FDA form 483) of routine FDA inspection(s) within the last two years. Moreover, the Contractor  must be in compliance with FDA requirements during the course of the contract performance.  All chemicals and drugs handled during the contact should be regarded as potentially toxic and should be handled accordingly.  Offerors will be instructed to describe their safety program and their proposed approach for the handling of toxic agents.  Proposals will be evaluated as to the adequacy of their facilities and their proposed method of handling these agents. It is anticipated that two (2) cost reimbursement completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of five (5) years.  The proposed contract project represents a recompetition of Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. Contract No. NO1-CM-77020. All responsible offerors will be considered.

PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
for
Smithsonian Website/Multimedia Pro-Bono Development

1.	General.  The Smithsonian Institution was created by Act of the United States Congress in 1846 to carry out the terms of the Will of James Smithson who bequeathed the means to found a national institution based in Washington dedicated to  ?the increase and diffusion of knowledge . . . .?  The estate property was accepted by Congress which pledged the faith of the United States to a charitable trust for the benefit of the People of the United States.  The trust is administered by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, composed of the Chief Justice, the Vice President, three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and nine citizens appointed by joint resolution of Congress.

2.	Background.  On April 30, 2002, the Smithsonian Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs (OEEMA) in conjunction with the Smithsonian Office of Contracting (OCon) conducted a Web/Multimedia Fair in which 68 web/multimedia vendors/producers participated.  At the Fair, Smithsonian staff were approached by multiple vendors requesting information about contracting opportunities for Smithsonian projects, whether paid or not.  In response to this unforeseen demand, Smithsonian program offices were invited to create a ?wish-list? of projects for which development and implementation were immediately desirable.  The result is attached separately to this notice for the review of any interested vendors (the ?Wish List?).

3.	Project Descriptions.  The Wish List is a synopsis, by Smithsonian museum/program office, of current needs for which there is no or insufficient money for development.  For all identified projects, we have estimated project size in accordance with the following scale: (A More Perfect Union <http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/experience/index.html> = small, Hirshhorn redesign <http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/> = medium, Explore the Universe <http://www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal111/universe/etu/index.html> = large), and, where relevant, the desired timeframe for completion. Initially created and posted on June 25, 2002, we intend to keep the Wish List up to date, adding newly identified needs and removing projects for which sufficient qualified and serious vendor response has been received as well as any for which a full commitment for programmatic support has lapsed.  Smithsonian reserves the right to rescind the Wish List in the event that insufficient response is generated on the identified projects.

4.	Minimum Requirements for Pre-Solicitation Response.  We can?t build it if you don?t come, therefore we invite interested and qualified vendors to identify those projects for which they would like to submit an offer.  To be responsive, submissions need merely identify your company, your URL, and any project(s) for which you desire the opportunity to develop on a pro bono basis. Please be sure to stipulate any restrictions which may apply to your level of interest (stating a hierarchy of preferred projects if, for example, you would care to submit a proposal for multiple ones but only enter into a contract to create a single one). This information will be collected and distributed to the originating program offices on a rolling basis, and for each project, as soon as a suitable bidlist has been established (e.g., at least 2-3 qualified candidates) we will contact the prospective offerors.  An indication of project interest by vendor(s) shall NEITHER obligate the vendor to submit a proposal to perform any work NOR obligate Smithsonian to invite proposals or issue contract(s) to have work performed.

5.	Responding to this Announcement:  Prospective offerors may ONLY submit information via e-mail to Bruce Falk, Office of Contracting at FalkB@si.edu.  Since it is presumed that relevant portfolios are viewable at the vendors? URL or obtainable upon request, no work samples are sought or required at this time. Offerors who submitted proposals in response to Smithsonian?s IDIQ RFP#F0236SOL0012 are permitted to make reference to any samples provided therein.  For these reasons, submissions greater than ONE SINGLE PAGE in length will be met with disdain.  (We are trying to make identification of desirable projects by interested firms as easy as possible; invited vendors will be given full opportunity to provide proposal(s) which address in detail specific project requirements.)

6.	Methodology for Competition.  Because these projects have little or no money attached to them, we will conduct the solicitation process in the following way.  First, the seriousness of vendor intent will be determined by follow-up contact prior to establishment of a bidlist, as bidlists will be kept small (preferring three offerors, but in no event more than five ? to the extent that more than five vendors express serious interest in a given project, we will make a determination as to which vendors to invite to submit a bid to ensure limited competition while minimizing vendor burden).  Second, identified, interested vendors will be provided with all criteria needed to draft a responsive proposal and invited to an initial discussion with the project team at least two weeks prior to the formal submission date.  Finally, Smithsonian shall evaluate the received proposals and intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is evaluated to be responsive to project/solicitation requirements and the best from among all proposals received.  While specific criteria for any given project will be established and provided to preselected offerors prior to establishing a proposal due date, it is likely that credit recognition for any pro bono work awarded as a result of this announcement will be approximately equal to or greater than that currently offered by Smithsonian for its fully-budgeted development.

7.	Further Contact Info.  Please contact Bruce Falk immediately if you desire to receive a copy of the Wish List by e-mail, fax, or other format.  Vendors desiring clarification can submit questions either by phone (202) 275-1602, or in writing, by e-mail, or by fax at (202) 275-0624.  (We will make all reasonable effort to answer questions, but cannot guarantee response.)  Thank you for your attention to this pre-solicitation notice.  We look forward to hearing from you!

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  is conducting a market survey to determine if there are commercial small businesses capable of producing  recombinant B19 pavovirus capsids in a baculovirus system for use in human clinical trials.  B19 parvovirus is the etiologic agent of fifth disease, transient aplastic crisis of hemolytic disease, some hydrops fetalis, and some chronic pure red cell aplasia.  Using well established technology, parvovirus capsids composed of both the major and minor structural proteins have been produced in conventional insect cell culture after infection with appropriate recombinant baculoviruses.  Structural proteins self-assemble into particles, which can be purified from cell lysates by sequential application of centrifugation, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and filtration.  Protocols are fully described in Investigational New Drug (IND) BB-IND 8553.   Purified B19 parvovirus capsids should be produced in quantities sufficient for planned clinical trials in humans:  1) for a phase I pilot dose-ranging study of normal  volunteers, to begin in July 2003, approximately 1 mg; 2) for a phase II/III multicenter vaccine efficacy study, to begin in April 2004, a single lot of 10 mg.  Capsids must be produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP), including industry standard quality control and assurance and production and delivery must be according to a pre-arranged schedule.  Product must be formulated in the appropriate adjuvant for delivery to participating medical centers.  The contractor would  be required to maintain the  IND with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and one is currently not available. All interested small businesses are requested to submit capability statements, by or before November 25, 2002, which must provide: 1) demonstrated ability to produce and distribute the B19 parvovirus vaccine in accordance with an established IND under GMP and in the quantities required; 2) documented experience with the baculovirus system for production of recombinant proteins; 3) the capability to purify viral capsids in bulk; 4) documented experience producing immunogens for human vaccines; and 5) evidence of working with the FDA and the ability to file and maintain an IND.  If your organization does not have the capacity to do this work, you must provide evidence of a partnering agreement with a larger business.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 325412, 750 employees.  The capability statement must be submitted on or before November 25, 2002, and  must reference number NHLBI-PS-2003-019.  Seven (7) copies of your capability statement should be delivered to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Building 2, Suite 6042, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902,  Attn: Gina Cianflone, Contract Specialist .

<DESC>Request for both sources sought and comments on DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), Areas Distribution Centers, for the A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for distribution of order entry, inventory, logistics and warehouse management activities required to support distribution of published products (e.g., forms, publications, Braille products, and CD ROMs) to the public and within IRS.

Objective
The Internal Revenue Service has three objectives for submitting this notice.  The first objective is to obtain industry comments on the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for an A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for distribution of forms and publications to both internal and external customers of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Government is currently performing this work.  The Government will consider all information received when preparing a final PWS; however, any and all changes are at the sole discretion of the Government.  In addition to comments to the draft PWS, please address the following:

1.	Proposal preparation period.  Length of time you believe you will need to prepare a proposal to adequately address all requirements;
2.	Contract term (length).  Typically, a service contract has a one-year base period and 4 one-year option periods.  Provide the advantages and disadvantages for having more than 4 one-year option periods;  
3.	Appropriate performance incentives.  Provide possible performance incentives and the advantages and disadvantages of each suggested incentive.  NOTE:  Incentives included in the best value private-to-private competition must also be incorporated into the Government?s Most Efficient Organization (MEO?s) proposal in order to compare like proposals for a cost comparison and final selection; and, 
4.	Any additional information you need from the IRS that would assist you in pursuing this effort as a business opportunity.

Any information provided is voluntary.  As such, the Government will not cover any costs for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this request.    Should the Government have questions regarding individual responses, the responder will be contacted for further information.  Please include the name of a point of contact, e-mail address and telephone number of this person.  This is DRAFT PWS and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a FORMAL RFP, RFQ or contract.  The DRAFT PWS is available at the following IRS internet site:  http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov  (under Business Opportunities).  All comments regarding the PWS and associated documents should be e-mailed to AWSS.RFI.ADC@irs.gov.  Only electronic comments will be accepted.

The second objective is to obtain capability statements, based upon the requirements outlined in the DRAFT PWS, of all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.   The acquisition under this A-76 study will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 493110, General Warehousing and Storage, which establishes a small business size standard of $21.5M.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than ten pages to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined in the DRAFT PWS. Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source?s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and a description of corporate experience with similar projects of like size and complexity.  In order for the IRS to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contract, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses for points of contact, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; or, (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business.

<CONTACT>FRANK HOLLEY, 309-782-2212
<DESC>NA The Mines, Demolition, and Grenades office of the Operations Support Command (OSC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing any or all of the various subject fuzes. The POC is: Frank Holley, US Army  Operations Support Command, Industrial Specialist, (309)782-2212. The technical descriptions of the items are as follows:  (1)	Fuze, Hand Grenade, M213, NSN: 1330-00-182-3570, DODIC: G877.  The M213 is a pyrotechnic, delay detonating fuze used to initiate fragmentation hand grenades. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the body.  When the lever is released, the spring loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer, which sets off the delay composition, detonator and the main grenade char ge.  The delay composition provides a fixed time delay.  (2)	Fuze, Hand Grenade, M228, NSN: 1330-00-168-5502, DODIC: G878. The M228 is pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used in conjunction with the M69 Grenade body, as a trainer for the M67 Fragmentation Hand Grenade. The M228 emits a small puff of smoke when acti vated.  The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring, and a safety clip. The safety pin and the safety clip are removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the body.  When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotat es and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter, which in turn sets off an audible signal and a white smoke charge.  The M228 functions the same as the M213 except it ignites versus detonates. (3)	Fuze, Hand Grenade, M201A1, NSN: 1330-00-293-9516, DODIC: G874. The M201A1 is pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used to ignite the M18 Smoke and the M83 training grenades. The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring assembly. The safety pi n is removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the body.  When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites the delay element, ignition charge, starter mixture, and on to the main charge.  This survey is being conducted to evaluate expansion of the production capability of the existing fuze base for the subject items.  This effort is in anticipation of potential increases in requirements that would create a greater demand for the subject fuz es than the current base is capable of handling. For purposes of this survey, anticipated quantities may be in the following ranges: M213 Pyro Delay Detonated Fuze:	50k-75k/month,  M228 Pyro Delay Igniting:	450-525k/month, M201A1 Pyro Delay Igniting Fuze:	15-40k/month.   Responses to this survey can be for individual fuzes or combined.  The M201A1, M213 and the M228 fuzes have been and are, currently produced by small business. This survey is going worldwide, to both, large & small business concerns. These three (3)items a re being researched together based on similarities in their production processes.

<SUBJECT>S -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO PRIVATIZE THE NATURAL GAS UTILITY SYSTEM AT JACKSON PARK NAVAL HOUSING, BREMERTON, WASHINGTON
<DESC>Notice of intent to privatize the natural gas utility system at the Jackson Park Naval Housing, Bremerton, Washington pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2688, as a sole source procurement with the local utility provider, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation. The Government's intent is to convey the utility system and award a long-term firm fixed price utility services contract.  On 16 April 2002, a Request for Proposal, N44255-01-R-8001, was issued as a competitive procurement to privatize this system.  Proposals were due on 14 August 2002.  No proposals were received in response to Request for Proposal, N44255-01-R-8001.  In accordance with Department of Defense Guidance for Privatizing Defense Utility Systems issued on 09 Oct 2002, the local utility provider, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, was contacted to determine if Cascade Natural Gas Corporation would be interested in entering into an agreement with the Navy to privatize the natural gas system at Jackson Park Naval Housing, Bremerton, Washington. As this procurement will now be a non-competitive action, this sole source negotiation will be accomplished under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which allows for the use of other than competitive source selection procedures when only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is to provide any other parties an opportunity to indicate an interest in the privatization of this utility system. All responses must be received within thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. No contract will be awarded on the basis of information received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a qualified comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government in a future procurement. If no acceptable interest is received, the Navy shall conclude that the only entity that can, as a practical matter, enter into an agreement to privatize the natural gas system at Jackson Park Naval Housing, Bremerton, Washington, is Cascade Natural Gas Corporation. Responses to this notice as well as any questions should be directed to: Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFANW), Attention Donald Myers, Utility Privatization Lead, 19917 7th Avenue NE, Poulsbo, WA 98370-7570.
