<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with Dr. Mark Thoman, Iowa, for the procurement of 250 medical monitoring records and the update of the Medical Surveillance (MEDS) field of the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) with state of the art data..  The period of performance is one (1) year with two (2) successive one-year option periods.
 
The Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) is maintained by NLM’s Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS).  This factual data bank includes data on chemical substance identification, chemical & physical properties, safety & handling, toxicology, pharmacology and environmental fate and chemical detection methods for over 4600 chemical substances.  Critical chemical-related information of medical surveillance data on individuals who are exposed to chemical substances is entered into the MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE (MEDS) field of HSDB.  The purpose of this procurement is to update the MEDS field with 250 medical monitoring records and to examine the contents of this field for the purpose of identifying outdated information and unsubstantiated methods.  

Dr. Thoman is uniquely qualified to provide these services.  Dr. Thoman has worked directly with SIS in the planning and selection of medical surveillance data for the HSDB file.  He has produced 262 MEDS protocols for chemicals covered in the Ryan RP, Toxicology Desk Reference and the Agency for Toxic Substance’s Disease Registry (ATSDR) for HSDB.  He has demonstrated high quality of work.  The HSDB’s Scientific Review Panel (SRP) has reviewed the data and found it to be of scientific excellence and utility.  He has over thirty years experience in developing medical surveillance protocols for the Federal Aviation Commission, the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.  He is a founding member of the Society of Clinical Toxicology and has served on numerous advisory panels at the local, state and federal level.  Dr. Thoman will continue to develop these MEDS protocols using the ATSDR, National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety, and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration’s federally mandated Medical Records/Monitoring rulings.  Dr. Thoman has extensive literature resources and has assisted in improving the quality of HSDB MEDS data.  

This service will be solicited using FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.  The capabilities statement should demonstrate that the interested party is able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) ability to write MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE records which are chemical specific based on experience with accidental or occupational exposure to chemical substances; 2) prior experience in the creation for MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE records that are accepted by NLM’s Scientific Review Panel (SRP) for scientific accuracy; 3) prior experience in regulatory issues of MEDICAL SURVEILLANCE at the federal level, such as OSHA’s medical requirements for individuals who are exposed to chemicals in the work place along with other agencies who provide detailed information on monitoring of exposed individuals to chemical substances; and 4) credentials that indicate a medical background with extensive experience in the subject area of clinical toxicology. 

Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 04-192/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to Neha Dhir on 301-496-6546.

<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail:  tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, has a requirement for a database with extensive worldwide coverage that contains organic geochemical data on oil and gas samples from exploratory wells and producing fields.  The database must be in digital form with precise location information such that data can be plotted on maps using Geographic Information System computer software.  The database shall include information on over 4,000 oils and 3,000 gases from exploratory wells and producing fields from around the world.  Access to such database is critical to the identification and mapping of petroleum systems for the World Energy and National Oil and Gas Assessments, and is required by the USGS to provide adequate coverage of geochemical data worldwide.   Based on information at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source requirement from Geomark Research, 9748 Whithorn Dr., Houston TX, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act 		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service  		SSA - Social Security Administration 		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program 		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor) (a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.  	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.  	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site: http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm . 	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9. (1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235. (2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. (3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.  	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.  	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings. The offers are due on 08/20/2004 buy COB, may be FAXED to 505 462 3794

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a contract in FY05 based on full and open competition to replace the AN/AIC-22 Intercommunication System (ICS) currently installed on some P-3 aircraft. The ICS provides intercommunication functions for crewmembers, operates jointly with the communication-switching matrix and secure-switching matrix, and provides the capability for crewmembers to select VHF, UHF and HF radios.  The current AN/AIC-22 installed on the P-3 aircraft has reached the end of its useful service life. The AN/AIC-22 ICS is obsolete, possesses low reliability and is labor-intensive to sustain. To address these issues, the U.S. Navy desires to replace the AN/AIC-22 with an improved reliability ICS using Commercial and/or Non-Developmental Items. The replacement ICS shall have, as a minimum, functionality and performance equal to the existing AIC-22 ICS. The scope of effort shall include the necessary engineering tasks, technical data and logistics to support the integration, test and installation of the replacement ICS into each applicable P-3 type model series aircraft configuration, as well as the procurement of production ICS for installation on fleet aircraft. It is contemplated that a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and four one-year options will be awarded for three trial kits and installations and 49 production kits, as well as engineering and logistics support services. It is expected that a draft Statement of Objectives and Performance Specification will be posted  on the NAVAIR Doing Business WEB site at www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business within 30 days of this publishing.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for fuels management services 40 miles south of Wells, Nevada in Southeastern Elko County.  The purpose of the STEWARDSHIP PROJECT is to mechanically treat approximately 200 acres of pinyon-juniper communities within the Valley Mountain area, and in doing so, restore crucial mule deer winter habitat, thereby reducing hazardous fuels, and preventing or reducing the potential for large scale burns within the crucial habitat.  The treatment will involve the removal of juniper and selective cutting of pinyon pine to create open areas approximately 10 to 50 acres in size with contiguous pinyon-juniper communities.  This action will allow for the reduction of hazardous fuels, including diseased trees, which will improve the overall forest health consistent with the Healthy Forest Initiative and Healthy Forest Restoration Act.  The period of performance will begin on or about September 27, 2004 and continue for not later than 12 calendar months from the effective start date. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS 115310.  This solicitation will be available on or about August 2, 2004.  A pre-proposal site tour will be held on August 12, 2004 at 8:00 am at the BLM Elko Field Office, 3900 E. Idaho Street, Elko, NV 89801.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Trinity Transition Consultants, LLC, 175 Campus Lakes Court, Bel Air, Maryland, 21015, to conduct phase II of diversity training for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), National Institutes of Health (NIH).  

The period of performance is August 2004 through May 2005.  Specifically, Trinity Transition Consultants, LLC, will provide Phase II of diversity training that involves creating and sustaining conditions that will allow what was learned in Phase I to be put to daily use in the workplace (training transfer and learning application – diffusion of cultural competence practices throughout the organization – awareness - into action, etc.).   The anticipated outcome of Phase II is to transform the organizational culture into one that is inclusive and values diversity; a workplace for everyone.  
    
The sole source determination is based upon the climate assessment study conducted by Trinity Transition Consultants, LLC as part of Phase I of the diversity training.    Phase II diversity training model was developed based upon the findings of the climate assessment study.   In order to maintain the continuity of the methodologies used by Trinity Transition Consultants, LLC, in the conduct of Diversity Training at the NCRR, NIH, and due to the knowledge gained by Trinity Transition Consultants, LLC, an award to any other source for this requirement would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.    The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and commercial item procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number “NHLBI-PS-2004-123,” may be submitted to the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20814-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute of Research Resources (NCRR) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Richard A. Knazek, M.D., 18330 New Cut Road, Mount Airy, Maryland 21771, to provide consultation services to the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), to guide, assist and facilitate NCRR with  an oversight of its General Clinical Research Centers (GCRC’s), National Gene Vector Laboratories (NGVLs), Islet Cell Resource Centers (ICRs), and the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) for the Division of Clinical Research Resources. 

Specifically, the tasks to be performed by Dr. Knazek, are to follow the scientific progress and financial status of each GCRC, within the assigned portfolio.  Dr. Knazek will consult with grantee organizations, review annual progress reports, attend programmatic site visits, advise the Division Director on budgetary and administrative matters.   Dr. Knazek, will also be responsible for the review of policy documentation in an effort to facilitate the evaluation of GCRC efficacy.   
The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise that Dr. Knazek has gained in the twenty years at the National Institutes of Health, and specifically ten years working with the Division of Clinical Research Resources within the National Center for Research Resources. During the past  twenty years Dr. Knazek has gained an in depth understanding of the extramural and intramural environments at NIH and the ability to communicate effectively with both areas of science, and research.   Dr. Knazek’s proactive approach in his management of clinical research programs reflects not only his intense support of the clinical research enterprise but also his innovational approach to complex, difficult, and often high-profile situations.  He is a very effective communicator and advocate for the research community.   In order to continue the successes gained by the NCRR in its clinical research programs, it is critical that a lapse in service does not occur.    Dr. Knazek is able to provide that continuity, continuing the work in the Division of Clinical Research Resources for NCRR without disruption of service.    For all these reasons, it is most cost effective to award this contract to Dr. Knazek who has the expertise in the scientific area, the understanding of the NIH environment and the specific knowledge and experience of the Division of Clinical Research Resources.    The period of performance for this project is from August 2004 through February 2005..  An award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Knazek, experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Program Support Center has a requirement for the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Policy and Evaluation (ASPE) to negotiate a modification to Contract Number 100-02-0014 with Life Plans, Two University Office Park, Waltham, MA  02453.  Contract 100-02-0014 was awarded September 15, 2002 to provide Long-Term Care Insurance Claimants Admissions Cohort Study Data Collection and Analysis.  This is a fixed price contract.  The primary purpose of the study is to understand how the availability of private long-term care insurance benefits affects the decisions made by claimants and their family caregivers to access various types of long-term care services both initially, i.e. when the policy holder enters into claim status, and over a subsequent period of time.  The proposed modification is a follow-on to the data collection and analysis that has been on-going since September 2002.   250 new cases shall be added to the study and thereby facilitate a comparison between the service seeking behavior of claimants holding traditional long-term care insurance policies with those holding policies with “consumer directed care” features.  Specifically the contractor shall collect additional survey data; identify other “consumer directed” claimants; conduct additional analysis and prepare a brief inclusive of executive summary, summary of study methodology, findings, discussion/conclusion and an appendix that outlines how the consumer directed policy administers benefits.  The period of performance for the new work is 24 months from date of award.  This modification has been justified in accordance with FAR 6.301-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Life Plans has an established rapport with the insurance companies participating in this project, has file system capabilities, specialized knowledge of the survey instruments, sample design and nurse assessment capability relating to private long-term care insurance which are required to perform the analyses.  Interested organizations capable of performing this work may submit a statement of capabilities with supporting documentation of its ability to meet the Government’s requirements,  specifically addressing  (1) existing relationships with long term care insurers, (2) data system capabilities for this nationwide study, and (3) specialized knowledge of the survey instruments, sample design and nurse assessment capability relating to private long-term care insurance.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Section 1 - Background

The Department of Defense (DoD) has begun an enterprise-wide transformation to improve its business and financial management operations.  One of the goals of the transformation is achieving an unqualified audit opinion on the FY 2007 DoD Agency-wide Financial Statements.  To assist the Department in achieving this goal, the Secretary of Defense established the Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP), which is leading the transformation.  One of the primary objectives of the BMMP is the development of the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  The BEA will provide the “roadmap” that will guide DoD decision-makers through the transformation and modernization of its business processes and systems.  Essential to obtaining an unqualified opinion on the FY 2007 financial statements, the Department must also aggressively resolve many Material Weaknesses while incrementally implementing the BEA.

Section 2 - Objectives

The overall objective is to assist the Director, BMSI, in creation of, and monitoring execution of, an integrated business transformation plan for DoD, focused on those functional priorities represented in the BMMP Increments.

AIS-I	-	none.
AIS-II	-	All employees.

Security Investigation Requirements for Automated Information Systems (AIS):

For AIS-I: Contractor requires access to the Comptoller Network which requires a Secret Clearance.  The contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category AIS I.  All contractor personnel requiring AIS-I access to the OUSD(C) systems will complete a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  An AIS-I position may be occupied pending the completion of the SSBI once the National Agency Check (NAC) portion has been completed and favorably adjudicated.  

For AIS-II: Contractor requires access to the Comptoller Network which requires a Secret Clearance. The contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category AIS II.  Contractor must ensure sensitive (privacy act) information is properly safeguarded at the work-site and not removed from the work site. In addition, the contractor will be required to comply with the security requirements associated with access to the OUSD(C) enterprise network.  This requires individuals who perform duties at the AIS II category to have a favorable determination of requisite investigation IAW the specifications of the DoD Personnel Security Program as provided for in the DoD 5200.2-R.  If required, the contractor may be requested to undergo a higher level of investigation.

For AIS-II: On an exception basis and if an emergency situation exists, a US citizen contractor employee may begin once the Waiver of Pre-appointment Investigative Requirements has been granted by the proponent Business Line Executive, Client Executive, or Corporate Director.  Waivers can be made, provided no potentially disqualifying information is known concerning the contractor employee, and all pre-appointment security checks have been favorably completed.  

Findings. All contractor employees must receive a favorable NAC or SSBI.  Unfavorable NAC or SSBI findings will require individual determinations by the security office before allowing contractor employee access to the facility.

Section 12 – Special Terms and Conditions

The Contractor may be required to have access to highly sensitive and confidential plans to complete required analysis and recommendations.

The Contractor shall keep confidential any proprietary information  received by DoD from other contractor sources.  The Contractor will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  The Contractor must have the proper authority and “need-to-know” prior to any discussions involving classified or sensitive information.  The Contractor will observe and comply with the security provisions in effect within OSD.  The Contractor shall notify the COR of any situation which, in the Contractor’s judgement, potential for OCI may exist so that the COR and the Contractor can take appropriate action to mitigate the OCI risk. 

The Contractor selected for this effort may be precluded from future competitive selection by a contracting officer of a subsequent procument:
(a) in which the Contractor will have an unfair competitive advantage because of work under this SOW or
(b) to provide systems (or major system components) for which:
(i) the Contractor provided systems engineering and technical direction or
(ii) the Contractor developed specifications or work statements.

The contractor may continue to provide services in the PMO support role.

In order to prevent or mitigate potential organizational conflicts of interest, the Agency may develop and include appropriate organizational conflict of interest provisions in this Contract.  In addition to and unless modified by such order-specific organizational conflict of interest provisions, the following restrictions and definitions apply to this Contract and are established to prevent conflicting roles which may bias the Contractor’s judgement or objectivity, or to preclude the Contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.  The following subsections prescribe certain limitations on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest, in order to ensure that there is no interruption in the work performed under the Contract.  

The Contractor shall discuss any potential or known conflicts with existing efforts being performed under the contracts or subcontracts under its purview.  The Contractor shall specifically identify the organization and individuals (by name, title, location, and telephone number) responsible for reviewing potential conflict of interest situations. DoD requires that the Contractor reviews each task under the Contract to identify those areas where a potential conflict of interest exists or where the “appearance” of a conflict of interest may exist.  The COR and the Contracting Officer will review each situation to determine whether or not the situation warrants cause for concern.  

If, under this Contract, the Contractor is tasked to prepare or assist in preparing a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services, the Contractor shall not supply the system, its major components, or the service unless the Contractor is the sole source, the Contractor has participated in the development and design work, or more than one Contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement.  The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this Contract and for two (2) years thereafter.

Unless the government and the Contractor first establish proper safeguards to ensure objectivity; the Contractor shall not provide technical evaluation under this Statement of Work in any procurement action in which the Contractor’s conclusions may be biased because the Contractor’s own products or services, or products or services that compete with the Contractor’s own products or services, are among those to be evaluated.

Non-Disclosure Statement

ALL Contractor employees who perform on contracts subject to organizational conflict of interest restrictions shall execute and sign a non-disclosure statement.   This requirement extends all subcontracts, teaming arrangements. A copy of this statement shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.   The statement shall consist of the following:

Conflict Of Interest And Non-Disclosure Statement

I certify that I will not discuss with, or reveal to, any representative of any business organization or other entity, or any individual person either within or without the United States Government, any aspects of pending procurements or awarded contracts of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) while performing services under HQ0421-XX-X-XXXX.  The term "any aspects of the pending procurement" includes, but is not limited to, information such as the identity and number of contractors, the method of procurement, the number and identity of Government personnel involved, and the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the source selection process, etc.  Except as specifically authorized by the PCO, the release of such information constitutes the unauthorized release of advance procurement or procurement information.

I recognize that a significant factor in the successful and proper completion of the source selection process is the strict confidentiality observed by all participants in the various proposal evaluation and evaluation review groups concerning all of the activities and procedures involved in source selection and that failure to comply with these requirements may compromise the ultimate source selection.  I acknowledge that the unauthorized release of advance procurement or procurement information as defined herein may result in the termination of my participation for HQ0421-XX-X-XXXX.

In the event I release any of the advance procurement or procurement information covered hereby, I agree to so advise the Senior Contracting Officer at the DFAS site to which I am assigned as soon as practicable.  That advice will identify the business organization or other entity, or individual person, to whom the information in question was divulged and the content of that information. 

I further affirm that in the event that any business entity, either as a prime or subcontractor, in which I, or a member of my family or household, have holdings, financial interest, or an employment relationship, of whatever nature and to whatever extent, has submitted a proposal in response to a DFAS requirement that I will notify the Senior Contracting Officer at the DFAS site to which I am assigned in writing.

Section 13 – Experience Requirements

Contractor will have experience in decision making in the DoD at the General Officer, SES or equivalent level.  Contractor will have experience as a program manager and experience in identifying and developing programs to rectify systemic problems in DoD asset valuation, accountability and management.  Contractor will have experience in determining and addressing, from both a near term work practice perspective and a longer term process and systemic solution, root causes of persistent DoD material weaknesses.  The Contractor must be thoroughly experienced and knowledgeable of the responsibilities of, and the key senior leaders within, various Offices of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the DoD Components (e.g., DCFO, Director A&FP&A, OUSD(AT&L), OUSD(LM&R), Directors of the BMMP Domains, and senior leaders within the offices of the ASA, ASN and ASAF FM&Cs); the Department’s Material Weaknesses and Component efforts to resolve them; DoD business and financial management policies, regulations and information technology systems; federal statutes and federal accounting standards; guidelines and requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Department of the Treasury; and issues and problems impeding an unqualified opinion as identified by the DoD Inspector General (IG) and General Accounting Office (GAO).

<DESC>UPDATE:  This update is to notify all that an amendment to the solicitation will be posted today, 28 July 2004.  Accordingly, the site visit scheduled for  today at 0900, has been postponed until 04 Aug 2004, at 0900.   This acquisition is for the Replacement of the HVAC Distribution System AFRL  Headquarters Facility 20015, Project 920014C.  The renovation of AFRL  Headquarters is in accordance with the long range Strategic Plan to improve  office space to an acceptable standard and maximize efficient utilization of  WWII facilities.  A major rework of the HVAC system (1970’s vintage) and  upgrade of Fire and Life Safety systems is long overdue.  In addition to code  compliance issues, a new suspended ceiling system, new fire detection and  suppression system, new carpet and paint will be installed.  Project will be  completed in two phases due to the configuration of the air handling units and  the lack of temporary office surge space. Special Requirements and Concerns:  Tight control of all subcontractors will be  imperative for success of this project due to the high profile occupants in the  building, HQ AFRL, GAO, and ASC/JA.  The construction will be completed in two  phases.  Occupants will have to relocate to another building during their phase  of construction.  Contractor will not be able to start work on Phase II until  he has completed Phase I, the occupants have moved back to Building 15 and  Phase II occupants and their furniture have been relocated.  Contract will  include maintaining temporary electrical and HVAC systems to occupied portions  of the building during construction.  Scope also includes hazardous material  abatement of asbestos and lead paint.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Division of Procurement Management (DPM), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Center for California Health Workforce Studies, University of California, 3333 California Street, San Francisco, CA, to evaluate the Title VII and VIII programs and their effectiveness in attaining the goal of training clinicians who serve in medically underserved communities. The contractor will: 1) develop a plan to contact Primary Care Associations nationwide to gather information on their staffing complement and staff training histories, and measures to be taken for obtaining any data needed for the study not now in possession of the contractor; 2) develop approaches to linking BHPr Title VII and VIII grants data to training experiences of Community Health Center (CHC) clinicians; and 3) identify and document CHC staff and related recruitment and retention experiences.  Clinicians currently working in CHCs shall be identified and personal data shall be collected (e.g., names, training institutions, dates of training, terminal degree held, practice specialty). Physicians'  undergraduate and residency training institutions shall be identified and classified as having received Title VII funding and years funded.  CHC clinicians shall be identified as having been exposed to Title VII or VIII funding through their respective schools. Procedures shall be developed to determine the statistical probability that clinicians staffing CHCs are more likely to have been trained in Title VII or VIII-funded programs.  The anticipated period of performance is twelve (12) months.  Under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1(a), the Center for California Health Workforce Studies (“Center”) is determined the only responsible source capable of performing the required services and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The Center, together with its subcontractor, the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Practice and Primary Care, is the only known source with an extensive proprietary database which includes a full listing of Title VII awards; a database of family practice physicians collected by the American Academy of Family Physicians augmented by data from the American Medical Association Masterfiles for five years (including 2002), including practice address and training history enhancements; and is the only central source known with the experience, resources and expertise to provide this evaluation.  This is a notice of intent – not a request for competitive proposals.  Contact Point: Nickie McKenna, Contract Specialist, Division of Procurement Management, OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, Room 13A-19, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; phone number 301/443-4175; FAX 301/443-5462; e:mail nmckenna@hrsa.gov.

<SUBJECT>B -- NCLB Outreach Strategy
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-OIIA-NCLB-04
<RESPDATE>080604
<ARCHDATE>08212004
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Intergovernmental and Interagency Affairs (OIIA), intends to make a sole source award to Mr. John Pace, located in Coral Gables, Florida, for expert advice on formalizing an intensive outreach strategy to the secondary markets throughout the country on behalf of "No Child Left Behind" (NCLB).  There is strong institutional resistance to the implementation of NCLB due to a tremendous lack of understanding of the law and its actual impact on states.  The outreach efforts require a high degree of understanding of NCLB, high level marketing experience on a national basis and a professional approach.  Time is also critical, as the announcements of AYP approach prior to the new school year will create confusion that can only be mitigated by information.

Mr. Pace will be tasked with analyzing the current strategic plan and defining quantifiable objectives, integrated strategies and tactics to make the current plan more effective; develop a marketing plan to brand No Child Left Behind and define a roadmap to get parents and educational clients (school district personnel and superintendents) to "buy into" No Child Left Behind legislation; and work closely with OIIA and its regional offices for ongoing consultative services for outreach and market penetration.

The contractor must have a broad and deep base knowledge of NCLB and its impact at the state level; unique expert background in marketing experience on a national basis for Charter Schools combined with corporate marketing experience; professional approach to outreach efforts; extensive knowledge of education policy; knowledge of government performance measurement; adequacy of time commitment, and effectively communicating a well-defined marketing campaign through a customized training program.

Mr. Pace uniquely meets the immediate needs for OIIA because of his broad and deep base knowledge of NCLB and its impact at the state level due to his most recent professional activity as a nationwide consultant for Charter Schools.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-04-10674, and the solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside competition Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. In seeking to apply concepts embedded in the Computational Toxicology Framework, this procurement is designed to: (1) evaluate the predictiveness of a toxicogenomic screening platform for identifying toxicity pathways; (2) provide analysis of the key toxicity pathways for five chemicals of interest to the regulatory programs of EPA; and (3) contrast the toxicity pathways, or lack therefore, amongst the five.  The resulting data and reports will also be used as educational materials to staff in the Office of Pesticide Programs in order to provide training on toxicogenomic data using directly relevant compounds. The period of performance will be 8 months from the date of award.  The contractor shall conduct the protocol, or an approximation agreed upon by the EPA, as described  below as a blinded study (i.e., unaware of the actual identities of the test chemicals) in order to assess their potential toxicity; to identify the likely pathologies that will be induced; to compare and contrast toxicities of the chemicals, and to provide information on the similarity of the test agents with toxicities of known chemicals in a reference database which shall contain a minimum of 100 chemicals. Data shall be provided for a total of five chemicals selected by the Agency. The study is to be conducted in 10-11 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the dosing vehicle for all chemicals shall be 15% Alkamuls EL-620 (Rhodia Inc., West Point GA) at a dosing volume of 5 ml per kg body weight. The study shall not be conducted under General Laboratory Practices (GLP) conditions, and the EPA will supply the chemicals to the contractor.  Verification of the  dosing concentrations and dosing solution stability are not required. The study shall be conducted in two phases: a dose range finding study, and a main study.  In the dose range finding study, three animals per group per chemical shall be exposed to a low, middle and high level by oral gavage for 14 days in order to establish the dose level that shall be optimal for the definitive study.  EPA will supply sufficient toxicity information on the individual chemicals to allow the contractor to select the three dose levels in the range finding study.  The contractor shall be responsible for selecting the dose level of the definitive study based on this information and knowledge of similar studies comprised in the reference database. The dose range finding animals shall be allowed a 7 day acclimation period prior to dosing, at which  time they shall be randomly assigned to one of the 16 groups (15 chemical treatment groups plus a concurrent control); body weights are to be recorded at the beginning of the dosing period, and at necropsy (24 hours after the 14th dose).  Prior to sacrifice, 350 :l of serum from all animals shall be collected, frozen on dry ice, and shipped to the EPA laboratory in Research Triangle Park, NC.  There shall be a full necropsy of all animals.  The liver weight shall be recorded, and a standard clinical chemistry panel shall be conducted.  Livers shall be fixed in neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for possible later histopathological examination.  In the main study design, the single dose of each chemical identified in the dose range finding study shall be used, with group sizes of fifteen animals per chemical.  Five animals from  each group shall be examined at 6 hr and 24 hrs post dose for each animal; while the remaining five animals per group shall be maintained and dosed daily at the same level for 13 additional days. For additional details on the study see EPA Website http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Upon completion of the gene expression study and analysis using the reference database and bioinformatic approaches, the contractor shall provide a report on the likely toxicities pathways and toxicities for each of the test chemicals.  Contractor shall also provide spreadsheets of expression data suitable for independent analysis and study by the EPA. To fulfill the Quality Assurance requirements for this contract, the Contractor shall provide, prior to award, a Quality Management Plan (QMP), which describes the quality system in terms of organizational  structure, functional responsibilities of management and staff, line of authority, and required interfaces for planning, implementing and assessing all quality assurance activities.  In addition, within 30 days of award, the Contractor shall provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), which comprehensively describes the necessary QA, QC and other technical activities to ensure that the results of the work performed satisfy the stated performance criteria.  QA guidance documents can be found on the internet at http://www.epa.gov/quality1/qatools.html.  The R-2 document discusses the Quality Management Plan, and the R-5 document discusses the QA Project Plan.  Work on this contract shall not begin until the EPA has approved these documents. The EPA reserves the right to conduct one on-site Technical Systems Review of the Contractor during the term of the contract.  Within 8 months from the date of the award, the Contractor shall provide reports describing the toxicogenomic profiles elicited by each of the chemicals, including the bioinformatic analyses indicating the likely toxicity pathways invoked and the predicted target organ pathologies.  Where possible, the predictions for the chemicals shall be compared and contrasted based on groupings of the chemicals provided by the Agency after completion of the in life phase of the study.  CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT: The contractor shall provide Reports solely to the Agency.  The Reports, including the results of the study and the gene expression data generated from test chemicals, shall be the property of the Agency.  The Reports shall contain confidential and proprietary information of  the Contractor.  Such information shall include description of the Contractor's models, methods, study designs for compounds not provided by Customer, identities or characteristics of such other compounds, bioinformatic tools, algorithms, and software as well as information and data excerpted from the Contractor's reference database.  The Reports shall also contain a complete list of submodel predictions, which the Contractor may consider to be proprietary and confidential commercial information.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: I.)Technical Capabilities: 1)Demonstrate technical approach to accomplish the  statement of work to include: a.)Number and diversity of chemicals contained in reference database. b.)Demonstrated ability to incorporate diverse biological and toxicological information into predicting algorithm. c.)Extent to which inclusion of predictive parameters can be included in open peer-reviewed publication. d.)Bioinformatic approach to generation of predicted toxicity profile. e.)Demonstrated ability to report on similarities and differences of measured responses across a series of related chemicals. f.)Demonstrated ability to map measured genomic responses across diverse  analytical platforms and gene chip designs.  2)Demonstrate adequacy of the Quality Assurance Management Plan.  3)Past Performance - Submit a list of 3  customers for whom like or similar services have been performed within the past 2 years.

1.  Vendor ask:  Does the hotel absolutely have to be a Four Star Hotel?   Will you consider a 3-Star?  We wish to acquire a four star hotel.

Chevron seating means the the tables are arranged in  "V" formation, in multiple rows, with the large end of the V open to the front of the room so that everyone can easily see the head table, speakers, etc.  Chevron seating is desired for the large banquet rooms when the entire group is together (17th and 19th of September).  Preferred seating in classrooms on the 18th of September is horseshoe shape (long tables arrange in a "U") so that the speaker/instructor is able to move about in the middle and everyone can see the other participants.


3. Vendor ask:   Do you need 50 rooms only for the 16 and again for the 19?   Do you need 150 rooms only on the 17 and 18th?  We need 50 rooms on the 16th and 19th, and 200 rooms (including the other 50)

<DESC>Site Visit Questions & Answers:

Questions for Bldg. 1600 Remove and Install Carpet

 

Is it possible to set up another site visit? Yes, 28  July 2004 @ 0930
 

Will the contractor be able to place a dumpster in the rear of the building?

 Dumpster placement -- we'll have to take a closer look as the time approaches.    At this point in time I don't believe so.  I have 1 contractor dumpster in place at the moment for a long-term project (Mar 05) plus our normal daily use dumpster for the building.  I have no space to put another one close enough to the dock entrance.

 

Can you provide access to a scaled set of drawings?   The current drawing is all we have at the moment. Please contact POC listed for an email or fax copy due technical difficulty the drawing can not be posted at this time. 

What are the wage rates for this project? Wage determination used for this requirement is stated in initial posting  WD may be accessed at https://www.ceals.usace.army.mil/netahtml/srvc.html

After reviewing the SOW I found that there is no stated performance period.  
  
What is the actual performance period? Performance Period is 60 days  after contract award
 

Will the contractor be able to stockpile a few days of material on-site?

Stockpile a few days materials on site -- I have space for a small conex type container which the contractor will need to provide and place for forward deployment of materials if he so wishes.  I do not have room in the building to stockpile much except maybe some carpet tiles.
 

At the end of every night does the contractor have to put all of the furniture back on the floor, or are we allowed to leave it suspended?

Replacement of furniture at the end of each night.  Yes.  Once an area is completed, the furniture needs to be placed back so it can be used.  The goal of this process is to create the minimum disruption to the operations in each area as possible.  If left suspended, it will cause operational disruption to the staff and they will be unable to work during the day until the furniture has been lowered.  If this is not possible, I need to know ASAP.




Quotes are due to this office NLT 4:00 PM CST on 31 July 2004.     Quotes may be faxed to the attention of TSgt Crystal Amos at (618)256-2652 or emailed to crystal.amos@scott.af.mil.

<DESC>Solicitation Number SB1341-04-Q-0796 dated July 28, 2004 is hereby amended to respond to a technical question submitted. Question: Line Item 0001 Specification (2) states that "Instrument shall be directly compatible with the vertical trinocular port of NIST’s existing Nikon Optiphot 2 Optical Microscope." Some instruments attach to a c-mount adapter, which is by far the most common type of adapter that is used with microscope trinocular ports(it's what's used to mount most video cameras, for example.)  Does NIST already have the c-mount adapter? Or is this part expected to be included with the system that NIST requires? Answer:  The trinocular port is already outfitted with a c-mount adapter, so there is no need to supply one with the instrument. NIST does not want to exclude the possibility of instrumentation that would not need the c-mount adapter and would directly attach to the trinocular port. The current response date, August 9, 2004 @ 3 pm local time, remains unchanged.
