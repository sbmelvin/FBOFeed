SECURITY OVERSEAS SEMINAR
Crisis Management (MQ911)


I.	INTRODUCTION

The Department of State's National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community.  The Transition Center (TC) division of FSI offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Security Overseas Seminar (SOS) program. The SOS program currently requires the services of a qualified and experienced contractor(s) to conduct twenty-six, fifty-minute presentations on crisis management in an overseas environment at each of the seminars.

II.	BACKGROUND

The overall aim of the SOS training is to motivate individuals to identify the likely security risks overseas and to develop a plan for dealing with them.  The presentations addressing personal security will be provided in direct support of the SOS program. Over two thousand participants per year attend these trainings.  Classes range from 30 to 200 participants with average class sizes being around 100.  Participants come from many U. S. Government agencies.  Their level of experience in the Foreign Service varies from newcomers in the overseas environment to veterans with twenty years or more of service and their family members.  This variance has proved to be both a benefit and a challenge.  Newcomers appreciate the firsthand experiences related by veterans.  However, it has been important that presenters be mindful to avoid elementary approaches that could bore those with more experience.  It has always been important to acknowledge individual experiences the audience members bring to the seminar and to provide some measure of audience participation. The two-day SOS program is offered twenty-six (26) times a year, and presents a variety of presentation formats in order to maximize the efficiency of the program.
