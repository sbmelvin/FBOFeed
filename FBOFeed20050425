This procurement is an unrestricted procurement with the HUBZone Price Evaluation Preference Provision 52.219-4.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) firm-fixed price construction contract for the Lauro Dam Project.  Reclamation, has a future requirement to perform construction work at Lauro Dam.  Lauro Dam and Reservoir are located on Diablo Creek, on the northern edge of the city of Santa Barbara, California.  The dam, which was constructed in 1952, is a zoned earthfill embankment with a structural height of 137 feet, a crest width of 30 feet and a crest length of 540 feet at elevation 567.5.  Lauro Reservoir is a regulating reservoir on the South Coast Conduit.  Inflow to the reservoir occurs via a turnout from the South Coast Conduit at a baffled drop structure located on the left side of the reservoir rim.  Its primary purpose is to meet the peak water demand for the City of Santa Barbara.  Lauro Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure.  The proposed construction work on Lauro Dam consists of a structural modification that incorporates a downstream filter and drain.  The work will require dewatering and excavation of the downstream face and toe of the dam, placement of layers of sand filter and gravel drain materials over the core material within the excavated area where an existing foundation fault exists.  Original embankment material will be placed over the drain materials, resulting in a significant portion of the crest and downstream face of the dam being wider than the original configuration.  The work will require the contractor to excavate at the toe or downstream portion of the dam with an active reservoir (reservoir elevation will not be lowered for construction).  The dam and associated land has limited work areas, staging areas are small, and limited stockpile areas.   The work requires over 4000 truck trips through residential areas to get material to and from the jobsite.  The contractor will be required to work limited hours due to city noise and work ordinances.  The value of the work is estimated in excess of $10 million.  The contract duration is contemplated for 12 months.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in September 2005.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.orca.bpn.gov.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed by e-mail to the Contract Specialist/Margaret Kirkpatrick at mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov.  The solicitation will be available on or about May 13, 2005.  The NAICS code is 234990 (All Other Heavy Construction) 18.  N/A 19.  N/A

<DESC>The FAA baselined a new Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL) Specification, FAA-E-2159e, in November 2004.  This new Specification replaces the older 1987 Specification, FAA-E-2159d, REIL with RMS.  A competitive Request-for-Offer (RFO) using this new Specification was released on April 22, 2005.  Meanwhile, the FAA has Congressional requirements to supply REIL systems to State of Alaska sites with near-term construction schedules (fiscal years 2005 and 2006).  The competitive acquisition process will not provide systems to meet these schedules. To fulfill the Congressional requirements at these Alaskan sites, the Product Team plans to negotiate a contract modification to DTFA01-03-C-00076 with DME Corporation, Fort Lauderdale, FL.  The FAA will procure 30 DME Corporation's currently approved REIL, Type No. FA-18300. The Product Team believes DME Corporation is the only source whose REIL system has undergone and passed first article tests under the FAA specification, it is fully supportable by the FAA Logistics Center and the FAA Academy, and therefore the only source capable of meeting the site construction dates.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by October 15, 2004.  The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plans to support a program that seeks to help Bolivia take advantage of trade opportunities, prepare for participation in trade agreements and improve trade capacity and competitiveness overall.

The second phase of USAID’s Bolivian Trade and Business Competitiveness (BTBC 2) activity will involve broader and longer-term interventions than the initial phase and will be a fully-competed, four-year contract with a total estimated budget within the cost range of $15,000,000 (fifteen million US Dollars) and $20,000,000 (twenty-million U.S. Dollars) plus $550,000 (five-hundred and fifty thousand) in local currency funds.  BTBC 2 follows an initial 2-year program that concentrated on the implementation of discrete, priority activities to help Bolivia with respect to immediate trade-related challenges, including taking advantage of trade preferences under the Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) and preparation for participation in trade agreements.  

We anticipate issuing the RFP 511-05-001 o/a October 15, 2004.  The due date for proposals is anticipated to be November 30, 2004.  USAID/Bolivia does not intend to conduct a Pre-proposal Conference.

The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.     All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.     The POC for this acquisition is Lt Megan Spilinek (302) 677-5226, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at megan.spilinek@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training System Division (TSD) in Orlando, FL, intends to award a sole source indefinite quantity contract (IQC) to CellExchange Federal, Inc., a small business, located at 1661 Worcester Road, Framingham, MA 01701 to provide ongoing operations, support, routine testing, minor improvements, research, development, testing, and evaluation of new functionality to the current Five Vector Model (5VM) presentation layer software.  CellExchange Federal, Inc. is currently providing ongoing maintenance and revisions to the 5VM and is the only known source with the unique capabilities and skills to execute the mission requirements.  The resulting contract will be firm fixed priced and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Pursuing award through competition would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through the competitive process and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the nonavailability of the 5VM.  The maximum length of the proposed contract will be 3 years, as a new architecture structure for this support is anticipated to be implemented within the next 12-18 months and conclude the need for the current effort provided under this contract.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512.  The requirement is to operate and maintain all components of the 5VM presentation layer software including, but not limited to the following tasks: maintain external links to information; incorporate changes in user communities such as additional ratings; display new and revised SkillObject data, RLOs, and RIOs; maintain user preferences; maintain accuracy of saved, displayed, reported data; maintain current capabilities and proper function of the 5VM application; administer access rights and permissions; maintain user documentation and on-line help; maintain error messages; maintain compliance to NMCI/IT-21/Forcenet/Sea-based requirements; maintain compliance to security requirements; correct deficiencies in the 5VM application; and capture, review, and implement minor usability improvements. The requirement also includes adding new functionality to support evolving training, career management business models and several ongoing initiatives in which CellExchange Federal, Inc. is currently engaged.  These initiatives include: 5VM Afloat, JASS Career Management System (JCMS), Type Commander Readiness Management System (TRMS), and Human System Interface (HSI).  The complex interdependencies of these initiatives, coupled with innovative approaches and yet to be defined architectures precludes the Government from detailing the requirements of the new functionality at this time and will require continued involvement and quick response on the part of the contractor.  The anticipated contract award date for the 5VM contract will be 15 June 2005.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD) intends to enter into negotiations with the CellExhange Federal, Inc. in ten (10) business days after publication of this notice.  Questions regarding the requisite technical capabilities required to perform the services for this sole source acquisition may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division (TSD), 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) intends to procure fabrication and installation services of a lighted aid to navigation/science platform.  The FKNMS is co-managed with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; together, they are charged with protecting the marine resources of the Florida Keys from Biscayne Bay through Dry Tortugas National Park.  Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary is one of the most well known and frequently visited reefs within FKNMS.  One of the most devastating causes of injury to the reefs in the Florida Keys are vessel groundings, many of which are the result of insufficient lighted aids to navigation in the area. Although Looe Key has numerous moorings and boundary buoys marking these zones, it is marked by only one true aid to navigation; a 20’ lighted marker (designated as "24”) on the Southeast corner of the reef.   There are no other lighted aids within 4 nautical miles of Looe Key “24”.  The main goal of this project is to establish a lighted aid to navigation on the Southwest corner of Looe Key to provide further protection from these vessel groundings.  Another important function of this platform will be to mount instruments for scientific research and public outreach programs known as the Telepresence Project.  The water depth is approximately 26' at the intended installation site.  The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, material handling for delivery to the offshore site, tools, testing devices, security, accountability, submittals, supervision, equipment, each and every item of expense necessary for supply, fabrication, erection, and installation of the lighted aid to navigation.  This generally includes, but is not limited to, the fabrication of the platform per the drawings and specifications provided by the Government, installation of the pile in the marine environment, and offshore fabrication to permanently affix the platform to the pile.  The contractor will be required to comply with all applicable laws including, but not limited to, the FKNMS regulations (15 CFR 922) and any permit conditions listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Private Aide To Navigation Permit, the Army Corps of Engineers Permit, and the FKNMS Manager’s permit.  NOAA will obtain the necessary Federal permits for this project.  The contractor shall be responsible for incorporating any permit requirements provided by the Government into the operations.

The Government intends to award a contract under FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR 15 (Contracting By Negotiation) following evaluation of the technical performance criteria and price.  The following technical performance criteria will be used in evaluating the proposals:  (1) Past Performance and (2) Experience with Similar Types of Construction.  Price and Technical Performance will be considered equal in value during the evaluation process. This is a 100% small business set aside. The NAICS code is 332999 and the small business size standard is a maximum of 500 employees. The size of project is between $100,000 and $250,000. The completion time for this project is sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed. It is anticipated that the specifications and solicitation package will be available on or about May 10, 2005.  Offers are estimated to be due on or about June 9, 2005.

<DESC>UPDATE 25 April 2005:  An updated draft Attachment 2 (Section L) and an updated draft Attachment 3 (Section M) have been posted in the Bidders Library  at the end of this announcement.  Changes have been made in red ink for ease  in identification. UPDATE 07 April 2005:  An updated draft RFP has been posted in the Bidders  Library at the end of this announcment.  The purpose is to pass on the  incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. The following attachments to the RFP have been updated as well:  CDRL Exhibit  A, CDRL Exhibit B, Attachment 1 (SOO), Attachment 2 (Section L), Attachment 3  (Section M), and Attachment 4 (TCP) and the DD 254. UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot  release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract. UPDATE 9 March 2005:  The briefings and documents promised at the B-52 Stand- off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference on 16 Feb 2005 are now available for  distribution.  There are two CDs available for distribution.  The first CD  (unclassified) was mailed on 7 Mar 05 to each company /office that attended  the conference.  The second CD (classified) is available for local  representatives of any company which attended the conference to pick up.

It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to the questions, and extend the combination synopsis/solicitation closing date to 2:00 PM, on 29 April 2005. Responses are as follows: QUESTION :  Although the solicitation discusses furnishings, we did not think to ask specifics about these items during the site visit.  ·	Where will they be located? The primary exhibit area with the glass panel and cases or at the portrait/entry foyer wall? Frankly, neither location seems to have enough room for this furniture. Also, the location of a loveseat, (2) armchairs and (1) coffee table will determine the appropriate size of each. Please advise. RESPONSE:  The loveseat and two matching chairs plus coffee table will be located in the primary exhibit area.  The loveseat will be placed centered in this area facing the glass panel.  The rear of the loveseat will be positioned where the carpet tiles and ceramic tiles meet.  The chairs will be placed accordingly to the right and left of the loveseat.  Ceramic tiles are being removed so that we will be able to extend the existing carpeted area.  The placement of the loveseat, chairs, and coffee table will serves as a conversation pit for waiting visitors.  From a design perspective the area has been carefully evaluated as relates to use of space and placement of furnishings.  QUESTION:  Upon award of contract, will we be provided with building drawings for reference (for electrical circuits, etc.) or will a facilities person help answer those types of questions? RESPONSE:  This question can be specifically addressed more appropriately by facilities management.  Facilities will be able to assist. QUESTION:   TECHNICAL PROPOSAL CONTENT, Item 4 - the sentence ends with "and...". Please provide missing information. RESPONSE:  Item #4 - Examples of acceptable techniques for raised letter metal plate with sample of letter styles in accordance with industry standard. QUESTION:  Flooring demolition will take some serious consideration and be a subcontracted function for us. Is it possible to send a floor contractor to see the space to review, first hand, the scope of work? We do understand that this morning’s site visit was to be the only time to view the space but thought we would ask the question anyway. RESPONSE:  No.  We have determined that commercial carpet installers are quite capable of handling the entire installation of carpet tiles and minor floor preparation of this task.  This task is not considered to be a major undertaking by those in the commercial carpet business.   QUESTION:  Will new vinyl cove base be required in the floor area?  If so, could you please provide the existing color specification? RESPONSE:  I will address the primary exhibit area first.  The broadloom carpeting applied to the wall will terminate flush where wall and floor come together.  Carpet tiles applied to the floor will be installed to butt flush where the wall carpeting meets the floor.  These carpet tiles will then serve as a locking element holding the wall covering in place at its lowest point.  These techniques coupled with the drawings provided will preclude the need for cove base installation in this area. There will be no need for cove base in the portrait entry area.  The existing ceramic tile base will remain.  The carpeting applied to the wall will extend from the ceiling and terminate flush at the top of the existing ceramic tile base.  QUESTION:  Prior to the commencement of the site visit, clarification, regarding the business size standard for the solicitation, was requested and determined to be it was a total small business set aside for NAICS 712110.  RESPONSE:  Yes, the government will enforce the $6 Million size standard.  The NAICS code used in our announcement is 712110 but contractors may bid under another NAICS code as long as the size standards of the NAICS code as advertised is not exceeded.

<SOLNBR>RWR
<RESPDATE>050305
<ARCHDATE>06012005
<CONTACT>Barry Foster,(937) 904-6674
<DESC>F-15 RADAR WARNING RECEIVER (RWR) REPLACEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1. Background This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI), by the United  States Air Force, F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group, Wright Patterson AFB, for  assistance in developing requirements for a replacement of the current Air  National Guard (ANG) and USAF F-15 C/D/E aircraft Radar Warning Receiver  (RWR), and conducting digital RWR technology survey demonstrations.  The USAF  is seeking to gain insight into the current state of digital RWR technology  and its possible application to fulfilling F-15 C/D/E aircraft RWR threat  warning requirements through industry participation in lab technology survey  demonstrations to be conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)  Sensor Directorate Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory  (IDAL) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  These demonstrations are expected to  begin in the late spring/summer of 2005. A non-developmental item (NDI) solution is the preferred approach to acquire a  core capability system that would be capable of growing to future capabilities  desired by the operational customers.  It is envisioned that a core capability  acquisition will be a competitively awarded System Development + Demonstration  (SDD) contract in 2008/2009.  In the interim, the government desires to gain a  better understanding of the available technologies and the risks associated  with these approaches.  The government will be maturing requirements for  follow on RWR development activities in parallel with the technology survey  and risk reduction process. These requirements, in conjunction with an  understanding of the state of technology, will be used to initiate the SDD  program. 2. RWR Functional Requirement Summary The objective will be to acquire an RWR that will be fully capable of meeting  Net-Centric Operations/Sensors Forward requirements defined in the ACC Sensors  Forward CONOPS based on a 2010 - 2030 threat projection and associated F-15  operational environments.  The preferred approach is to use a non- developmental item (NDI) system.  The RWR upgrade is planned to employ digital  receiver technology that enables F-15 situational awareness, self- protection/electronic protection, battle management, ELINT, weapons support,  and electronic attack functioning. The RWR upgrade is to be compatible, i.e.,  fully functional and interoperable with other F-15 onboard systems and  formation platform systems including active-element electronic scanned array  (AESA) radar systems. The RWR upgrade architecture is to be flexible,  reprogrammable, and adaptable to changes in threat and technology growth  insertion. Modular open system approach (MOSA) principles should be applied to  the degree practical in the acquisition/integration effort. Adequate growth  reserve and architecture strategies should be available for anticipated  maturation of capabilities to handle the anticipated 2010-2030 growth in  threat and mission requirements. The program objective is to acquire an RWR  upgrade capability (system) with as much commonality as possible between the  ANG and USAF F-15 fleets.  The goal is to have one RWR configuration for the F- 15 fleets with Group A modifications to the F-15 aircraft minimized to the  maximum extent possible. 3. Evolutionary Acquisition Strategy It is assumed that cost and development risk factors will require multiple  development spirals/increments to fully meet these capabilities.  Thus, an  evolutionary acquisition strategy is anticipated, incorporating a block  upgrade approach leveraged off of the initial RWR NDI core capability to  achieve full capability.  It is also assumed that the initial upgraded RWR  core capability will be acquired as a NDI as defined in FAR 2.101.  Block  upgrade definition and the evolutionary acquisition strategy will be based on  cost and risk factor assessments with each fielded block having a specified  operational capability against a requirements/capability roadmap toward  meeting full capability objectives. It is currently estimated that an SDD  contract would be awarded in FY08 or FY09 with the intent, for acquisition  planning purposes, to upgrade 179 F-15C/D and 225 F-15 E aircraft.  4. RFI Tasks/Schedule of Events 4.1. Kick-off Meeting A kick-off meeting will be held on 31 March 05.  It will be located at the ANG  Flight Test Center in Tucson, AZ.   There will be a morning session with all  suppliers.  The Government will give more details about the tasks and schedule  of remaining events, including an overview of the laboratory survey effort and  an overview of F-15 avionics.  The afternoon will consist of one-on-one  information exchange sessions with each supplier, tentatively planned for 30  minutes each.   Kick-off meeting agenda is as follows:   Morning (8:00, Mountain Standard Time)      •	Tuscon Welcome:  Air National Guard      •	User Introduction:  Air National Guard + Air Combat Command      •	RFI Overview:  F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group      •	IDAL Introduction:  Air Force Research Lab Sensors Directorate      •	F-15 System Overview:  Boeing      •	Test Methodology:  Air National Guard   Afternoon      •	Information exchange sessions with individual vendors Vendors interested in attending the kick-off meeting should contact the F-15  Aeronautical Systems Group RWR Program Manager, Allen Martin at (937) 904- 6647, by 25 March 05, indicating number or people planning to attend (limited  to 4 representatives per vendor). Neither attendance at the kick-off meeting nor participation in the technology  survey is a prerequisite for consideration in any eventual SDD contract  competition.   The Air Force is however encouraging maximum industry  participation at the outset to enable the fullest possible assessment of the  state of technology.    4.2. White Paper In written response to this RFI, interested parties should submit a white  paper no later than 23 Jun 05, addressing, as a minimum, the following areas:      •  Describe your capability and interest in participating in a technology  survey.      •	Provide evidence that you have the personnel and system resources to  support IDAL laboratory demonstration testing starting in late spring/summer  2005.      •	Provide insight into your current digital RWR technology maturity.   Provide state of development and current performance capability/demonstration  results, and planned technology roadmaps.  For the sake of brevity, you may  reference existing test reports that illustrate performance against the threat  classes of interest.  The government may ask to review these reports later.       •	Indicate your system’s maturity level according to the (DoD/NASA)  standard Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).  The survey will consider systems  at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and above.  (TRL definitions available  in the Defense Acquisition Handbook at the following ling:   http://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document+rf=GuideBook\IG_c10.5.2.asp).      •	Provide a description of how your system is instrumented and what test  data will be made available during the survey. 4.3. IDAL Technology Survey Suppliers may participate in the technology survey by demonstrating their RWR  technology in IDAL (Wright-Patterson AFB, OH).  A common set of RF threat  scenarios will be utilized for the IDAL demonstrations.  It is expected that  the technology survey will start in May 2005 and last through January 2006.   It is also expected that each participating supplier will support 1-3 IDAL  test planning meetings and up to 7 weeks of multiple IDAL entries.  The IDAL  demonstration results will be utilized to provide insight into the maturity  and risks associated with digital RWR technologies. The F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group will coordinate/facilitate supplier  participation in the technology survey, including all coordination with IDAL  personnel.  The Group will also make available pertinent documentation,  including all documentation referenced in this RFI.  The USAF will pay for all tasks performed by IDAL personnel as well as for all  IDAL equipment usage.  The USAF will also pay to have reports written for each  demonstrated RWR, documenting its performance.  Each supplier will be offered  a copy of the report for their system. Each supplier will be expected to pay for their personnel who support the  survey, including tasks such as test planning and system set-up and support at  IDAL, transporting their system to/from IDAL, and any repairs to their system  that may need to be made during the survey Individual Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) will be  established between the Air Force and each collaborating party in the  technology survey, defining terms and conditions, and bounding the roles and  responsibilities of each party.  A draft CRADA document will be made  available at the kick-off meeting for review and comment.   5. Data/Security Issues •  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be  properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not  use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability,  requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict  competition. •  As the F-15 prime contractor, Boeing personnel will be active participants  in all tasks.  Each participating supplier will be required to establish  associate contractor agreements with the Boeing Company. •  Each participating supplier must have access to USAF classified threat  information, to include blue threat information, or that you have an approach  to use sanitized information.  The maximum required classification level will  be SECRET/NOFORN or SECRET/US ONLY. 6. Anticipated Contractual Requirements  •  Interested parties are advised that any eventual production contract would  include the following contractual requirements:      o	 FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act—Supplies, as well as completion of  certificate at FAR 52.225-2      o	AFMCFARS 5352.227-9000, Export-Controlled Data Restrictions, and  AFMCFARS 5352.227-9001 Qualification of Offeror Under Export-Controlled  Restricted Solicitation.       o	DFARS 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities      o	DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation  The purpose of this RFI is to identify and obtain information from all  responsible sources and interested parties who have a product that may  potentially meet USAF requirement for replacement of the F-15 Radar Warning  Receiver, as identified herein.

<DESC>F-15 RADAR WARNING RECEIVER (RWR) REPLACEMENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) 1. Background This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI), by the United  States Air Force, F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group, Wright Patterson AFB, for  assistance in developing requirements for a replacement of the current Air  National Guard (ANG) and USAF F-15 C/D/E aircraft Radar Warning Receiver  (RWR), and conducting digital RWR technology survey demonstrations.  The USAF  is seeking to gain insight into the current state of digital RWR technology  and its possible application to fulfilling F-15 C/D/E aircraft RWR threat  warning requirements through industry participation in lab technology survey  demonstrations to be conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)  Sensor Directorate Integrated Demonstrations and Applications Laboratory  (IDAL) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  These demonstrations are expected to  begin in the late spring/summer of 2005. A non-developmental item (NDI) solution is the preferred approach to acquire a  core capability system that would be capable of growing to future capabilities  desired by the operational customers.  It is envisioned that a core capability  acquisition will be a competitively awarded System Development + Demonstration  (SDD) contract in 2008/2009.  In the interim, the government desires to gain a  better understanding of the available technologies and the risks associated  with these approaches.  The government will be maturing requirements for  follow on RWR development activities in parallel with the technology survey  and risk reduction process. These requirements, in conjunction with an  understanding of the state of technology, will be used to initiate the SDD  program. 2. RWR Functional Requirement Summary The objective will be to acquire an RWR that will be fully capable of meeting  Net-Centric Operations/Sensors Forward requirements defined in the ACC Sensors  Forward CONOPS based on a 2010 - 2030 threat projection and associated F-15  operational environments.  The preferred approach is to use a non- developmental item (NDI) system.  The RWR upgrade is planned to employ digital  receiver technology that enables F-15 situational awareness, self- protection/electronic protection, battle management, ELINT, weapons support,  and electronic attack functioning. The RWR upgrade is to be compatible, i.e.,  fully functional and interoperable with other F-15 onboard systems and  formation platform systems including active-element electronic scanned array  (AESA) radar systems. The RWR upgrade architecture is to be flexible,  reprogrammable, and adaptable to changes in threat and technology growth  insertion. Modular open system approach (MOSA) principles should be applied to  the degree practical in the acquisition/integration effort. Adequate growth  reserve and architecture strategies should be available for anticipated  maturation of capabilities to handle the anticipated 2010-2030 growth in  threat and mission requirements. The program objective is to acquire an RWR  upgrade capability (system) with as much commonality as possible between the  ANG and USAF F-15 fleets.  The goal is to have one RWR configuration for the F- 15 fleets with Group A modifications to the F-15 aircraft minimized to the  maximum extent possible. 3. Evolutionary Acquisition Strategy It is assumed that cost and development risk factors will require multiple  development spirals/increments to fully meet these capabilities.  Thus, an  evolutionary acquisition strategy is anticipated, incorporating a block  upgrade approach leveraged off of the initial RWR NDI core capability to  achieve full capability.  It is also assumed that the initial upgraded RWR  core capability will be acquired as a NDI as defined in FAR 2.101.  Block  upgrade definition and the evolutionary acquisition strategy will be based on  cost and risk factor assessments with each fielded block having a specified  operational capability against a requirements/capability roadmap toward  meeting full capability objectives. It is currently estimated that an SDD  contract would be awarded in FY08 or FY09 with the intent, for acquisition  planning purposes, to upgrade 179 F-15C/D and 225 F-15 E aircraft.  4. RFI Tasks/Schedule of Events 4.1. Kick-off Meeting A kick-off meeting will be held on 31 March 05.  It will be located at the ANG  Flight Test Center in Tucson, AZ.   There will be a morning session with all  suppliers.  The Government will give more details about the tasks and schedule  of remaining events, including an overview of the laboratory survey effort and  an overview of F-15 avionics.  The afternoon will consist of one-on-one  information exchange sessions with each supplier, tentatively planned for 30  minutes each.   Kick-off meeting agenda is as follows:   Morning (8:00, Mountain Standard Time)      •	Tuscon Welcome:  Air National Guard      •	User Introduction:  Air National Guard + Air Combat Command      •	RFI Overview:  F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group      •	IDAL Introduction:  Air Force Research Lab Sensors Directorate      •	F-15 System Overview:  Boeing      •	Test Methodology:  Air National Guard   Afternoon      •	Information exchange sessions with individual vendors Vendors interested in attending the kick-off meeting should contact the F-15  Aeronautical Systems Group RWR Program Manager, Allen Martin at (937) 904- 6647, by 25 March 05, indicating number or people planning to attend (limited  to 4 representatives per vendor). Neither attendance at the kick-off meeting nor participation in the technology  survey is a prerequisite for consideration in any eventual SDD contract  competition.   The Air Force is however encouraging maximum industry  participation at the outset to enable the fullest possible assessment of the  state of technology.    4.2. White Paper In written response to this RFI, interested parties should submit a white  paper no later than 23 Jun 05, addressing, as a minimum, the following areas:      •  Describe your capability and interest in participating in a technology  survey.      •	Provide evidence that you have the personnel and system resources to  support IDAL laboratory demonstration testing starting in late spring/summer  2005.      •	Provide insight into your current digital RWR technology maturity.   Provide state of development and current performance capability/demonstration  results, and planned technology roadmaps.  For the sake of brevity, you may  reference existing test reports that illustrate performance against the threat  classes of interest.  The government may ask to review these reports later.       •	Indicate your system’s maturity level according to the (DoD/NASA)  standard Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).  The survey will consider systems  at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 and above.  (TRL definitions available  in the Defense Acquisition Handbook at the following ling:   http://akss.dau.mil/dag/DoD5000.asp?view=document+rf=GuideBook\IG_c10.5.2.asp).      •	Provide a description of how your system is instrumented and what test  data will be made available during the survey. 4.3. IDAL Technology Survey Suppliers may participate in the technology survey by demonstrating their RWR  technology in IDAL (Wright-Patterson AFB, OH).  A common set of RF threat  scenarios will be utilized for the IDAL demonstrations.  It is expected that  the technology survey will start in May 2005 and last through January 2006.   It is also expected that each participating supplier will support 1-3 IDAL  test planning meetings and up to 7 weeks of multiple IDAL entries.  The IDAL  demonstration results will be utilized to provide insight into the maturity  and risks associated with digital RWR technologies. The F-15 Aeronautical Systems Group will coordinate/facilitate supplier  participation in the technology survey, including all coordination with IDAL  personnel.  The Group will also make available pertinent documentation,  including all documentation referenced in this RFI.  The USAF will pay for all tasks performed by IDAL personnel as well as for all  IDAL equipment usage.  The USAF will also pay to have reports written for each  demonstrated RWR, documenting its performance.  Each supplier will be offered  a copy of the report for their system. Each supplier will be expected to pay for their personnel who support the  survey, including tasks such as test planning and system set-up and support at  IDAL, transporting their system to/from IDAL, and any repairs to their system  that may need to be made during the survey Individual Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADA) will be  established between the Air Force and each collaborating party in the  technology survey, defining terms and conditions, and bounding the roles and  responsibilities of each party.  A draft CRADA document will be made  available at the kick-off meeting for review and comment.   5. Data/Security Issues •  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be  properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not  use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability,  requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict  competition. •  As the F-15 prime contractor, Boeing personnel will be active participants  in all tasks.  Each participating supplier will be required to establish  associate contractor agreements with the Boeing Company. •  Each participating supplier must have access to USAF classified threat  information, to include blue threat information, or that you have an approach  to use sanitized information.  The maximum required classification level will  be SECRET/NOFORN or SECRET/US ONLY. 6. Anticipated Contractual Requirements  •  Interested parties are advised that any eventual production contract would  include the following contractual requirements:      o	 FAR 52.225-1, Buy American Act—Supplies, as well as completion of  certificate at FAR 52.225-2      o	AFMCFARS 5352.227-9000, Export-Controlled Data Restrictions, and  AFMCFARS 5352.227-9001 Qualification of Offeror Under Export-Controlled  Restricted Solicitation.       o	DFARS 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities      o	DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation  The purpose of this RFI is to identify and obtain information from all  responsible sources and interested parties who have a product that may  potentially meet USAF requirement for replacement of the F-15 Radar Warning  Receiver, as identified herein.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond intends to acquire Covers through the use of long-term contracts awarded against solicitation SP0412-05-R-2656.  This solicitation is comprised of Government identified groupings of NSNs consisting of 72 individual line items.  The Government will separately evaluate and award each group rather than evaluate and award on a per line item basis.  Assuming the Government receives one or more offers for each group, the Government will evaluate the offers on the basis of the Total Group Price (TGP).  The TGP is the sum of the individual line item prices for the total contract period.  The individual line item price is sum of the unit price multiplied by the anticipated demand quantity for each contract period.  The evaluated price will also include any other price evaluation factors identified elsewhere in the solicitation (e.g. first article costs).  It is anticipated that split awards will be made against this solicitation.  The resultant contracts will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The contracts will have a twenty four month base period and three twelve-month option periods for total maximum period of performance of 5 years if all options are exercised.  The NSNs in this solicitation all fall under FSC’s 1560 & 1620.  Once released (see issue date below) the solicitation will be found at http://www2.dscr.dla.mil/externalweb/UserWeb/FAGA/index.html and on the procurement gateway.  There are drawings associated with some of the NSNs covered by this acquisition.  In order to obtain access to drawings, offerors must be registered on the DSCR Technical Data Management Division website.  It is suggested that vendors who are not already registered access the following web-site to register prior to release of the solicitation http://www.dscr.dla.mil/tdmd/mb_index.asp.   The solicitation will be issued on 13 May 2005 and close on 13 June 2004.  Documents will not be available until the solicitation issue date.

<RESPDATE>042905
<ARCHDATE>04252006
<CONTACT>Ginger Thacker Contract Specialist 5037364445     ginger_thacker@fws.gov;
<DESC>BPA:  Interested contractors must be registered in the CCR and must show interest by submitting a price list for services.  For consideration, send current price list to: Ginger_Thacker@fws.gov   or fax to: (503) 231-6259.  Further synopsis is contingent upon interest received by this announcement. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Willapa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, 3888 SR 101, IIwaco, WA 98624-9707, has a requirement for maintenance for airboats and Spray Systems.  The Service intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement to one or more vendors providing this type of service, as required.  Calls will be issued to the contractor in advance of, as well as specifying, and authorizing, all required work.  Vendor must be within a reasonable commuting distance, have the capabilities to service this type of equipment, and possess industry standard qualifications to perform maintenance on airboat type watercraft.  The contractor must provide to the refuge accurate and complete records relating to the maintenance and repairs performed on each airboat, airboat trailer and spray system.  This maintenance and repair BPA will be active year round with the majority of the repairs and maintenance work to be completed during the active work season window (May through October).  SCOPE:  Contractor will be responsible for inspecting and conducting  the routine 100 hour maintenance, completing annual tune-ups and necessary major and minor repairs on seven (7) airboats, seven (7) airboat trailers and six (6) high volume handheld spray systems. The airboat motors are high performance Chevrolet motors one (1) is a 454 motor and the remaining six (6) are 502 motors.  The boat hulls themselves are open aluminum 18' hulls lined with UHMW (poly plastic) underneath.  The trailers are galvanized tandem axle trailers without trailer brakes.  Work performed will comply with specification listed in the airboat manual and will in no way void the warranty on the airboat and/or airboat trailer.   The spray system is a Honda Pump motor operating a high volume-high pressure pump (call refuge for further information) capable of delivering a high volume of liquid substance through two (2) hose reels with 200' of hose at a 200 (+) PSI pressure.  The spray system as a whole is attached together and mounted on top of a 100 gallon spray tank and attached by a siphon hose.  No work will be performed which will void the warranty on the spray system motor or spray system pump.   TASKS:   Contractor will conduct major and minor repairs and provide annual tune-ups on seven (7) airboats.  This work includes, but is not limited to repair and/or replacement of airboat engines, tune-up and carburetor repair/adjustments. All repairs and anything outside the scope of this contract, such as airboat engine replacement, will require approval by Refuge Manager or designated employee.   This general maintenance contract includes, but is not limited to changing the oil and oil filter on the airboat engine, greasing all zerts on engine, motor accessories (prop gear housing when specified) and trailer, adjusting drive and alternator belts if needed, visual inspection of engine mounts and engine stand at all points of attachment to the boat for possible failure, and ensuring all gauges are operating properly.  All major repairs, such as motor replacement, will require approval by Refuge Manager or designated Refuge employee.

<DESC>All responses or any technical questions shall be directed to: Michael J. Lewis MS 23-3 (216) 433-8361 or e-mail Michael.J.Lewis@nasa.gov. NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) portable hand-held and head-mounted displays (HMD) systems, and/or prototype display devices, which have low volume, weight, and power characteristics.   Hand-held display devices and technologies ideally should provide roughly 3”x 4” display size at better than ¼ VGA resolution, and be capable of operation over a very wide temperature range, -150 C to 100 C.  Currently available flat panel displays, which cannot operate in the extreme temperatures, must have the potential to do so though some form of customization, however the maximum power consumption must be less than 10 Watts.  Displays brightness and contrast should be adequate for operation in near full sunlight/daylight conditions.  Display interfaces should conform to industry standards for wired and wireless devices (eg. RS-232, RS-485, TTL, RS-170A, IEEE 801, Computer VGA, XGA, etc.)  Hand-held displays will ultimately be utilized in a forearm-mounted configuration for direct viewing at a distance between 1-2 ft from the user. NASA is interested in both See-Through and Non-See-Through portable HMDs, which utilize direct view, combiner optics, and visor projected optical configurations.  Non-See-Through systems are intended for use in the viewer’s peripheral vision and should not significantly obscure vision straight ahead.  Optimally, a See-Through HMD would provide information in a visor projected system similar to augmented reality HMDs, but without the need for viewer tracking.  In all configurations the display should provide roughly 25 deg. x 25 deg. apparent FOV, and the required optics to focus the display so as to appear from 2 ft. to infinity, with a minimum of 1” eye relief.	Display resolution of VGA or greater is desired.  As with hand-held displays, HMD displays should provide adequate brightness for near sunlight/daylight viewing, and adhere to industry interface standards for wired and wireless display devices, but need only operate in ambient temperatures and pressures.  Any HMD will ultimately be implemented in a very restrictive volume envelope, which can be estimated by a 2-3” thick hemispherical shell around the viewer’s face.  Any system which exceeds this envelope, should be shown to have the potential to be adapted from its base configuration. Interested parties may submit their capabilities or any questions about this RFI via e-mail only, to the address:  aeva.displays.rfi@grc.nasa.gov Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements should contact Mike Lewis and inform him of:  name and address of firm, whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; and point of contact - address and phone number).   No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references.   Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to: Michael J. Lewis.  Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.   Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (FAR 15.201). THE GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS THAT MAY BE INTERESTED IN AND HAVE CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THE GENERAL STATEMENT OF WORK BELOW. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. Due to frequent use of LZ (Landing Zone) operations and the large amount of fine sand and pea gravel that makes up many of our FARP/LZ sites, many FARP (Forward Arming and Refueling Point) sites experience a massive amount of brown-out (airborne sand) during the helicopter landings.  This brown-out condition becomes a major SOF (Safety of Flight) issue.  Without the proper dust abatement product numerous aircraft will wave-off from landing at the FARP which would further exacerbate the problem.  Brown-out and wave offs make for an undesired and unsafe condition for personnel and the potential for an aircraft mishap to occur.  Additionally, any gravel or sand displ! aced airborne by aircraft rotor wash produces a FOD (Foreign Object Debris) hazard to both aircraft and personnel.  Product must meet the following specifications: Meet EPA regulations;Comply with the Clean-Air Act initiative; Be environmentally safe, bio-degradable, non-corrosive, non-flammable, and non-tracking to shoes, tires, or aircraft metal skids; Withstand high (110-120 F) temperatures without any chemical breakdown resulting in reduced effectiveness; Product must be surface sprayed requiring no additional earthwork; Product must withstand sharp maneuvering of aircraft rubber tires; Product must be derived from organic materials that are not harmful to flora, fauna, or aquatic life; Product must withstand numerous helicopter landings and be non water soluble as application will be in flash flood areas. Application of product is a requirement with the following criteria: Application must be able to penetrate at a minimum of ½ inches below the surface with no flaking; ! Contractor must provide his own water supply as there will be none available at locations needing application of dust abatement product; Contractor shall furnish all supplies, vehicles, tools, and equipment; Locations are in austere areas and will require that contractor be able to drive equipment off-road to get to locations. Potential sites include: AUX II (approximately 20 miles southeast of MCAS Yuma). Soil composition: sand (fines) mixed with gravel/rocks/and asphalt in some areas, ranging from pea size to approximately 5 inches in diameter; Application area: approximately 100,000 sq ft; Off-road capability needed in some locations. LZ BULL (about 80 miles northwest of MCAS Yuma, near Glamis, California). Soil composition: volcanic rock ranging in size from pea gravel to 10 inches in diameter.  Majority of area covered by rocks with sand (extremely fine MOON DUST), interspersed and below rock covering.  Very easily dispersed fines by rotor wash or when cover layer is di! sturbed by vehicle traffic; Application area: approximately 200,000 sq ft; Off-road capability required.  STOVAL (about 80 miles east of MCAS Yuma, in Dateland, Arizona.). Soil composition: sand (fines) mixed with gravel/rocks/and asphalt in some areas.  Majority of area covered by rocks with sand (extremely fine MOON DUST) in center of the airfield; Application area: approximately 250,000 sq ft; Off-road capability not required. STAR (about 120 miles northwest of MCAS Yuma, near Glamis, California). Soil composition: volcanic rock ranging in size from pea gravel to 10 inches in diameter;  Majority of area covered by rocks with sand (extremely fine MOON DUST), interspersed and below rock covering.  Very easily dispersed fines by rotor wash or when cover layer is disturbed by vehicle traffic; Application area: approximately 200,000 sq ft; Off-road capability required. SIPHON 8 (about 100 miles northwest of MCAS Yuma, near Calipatria, California). Soil composition: volcanic ro! ck ranging in size from pea gravel to 10 inches in diameter.  Majority of area covered by rocks. Very easily dispersed fines by rotor wash or when cover layer is disturbed by vehicle traffic. Application area: approximately 150,000 sq ft; Off-road capability required.  Volume of product will vary according to military requirements.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) provides data center services that centrally manage computer systems and computer operations for the Agency.  This agency-wide service, known as the NASA Data Center (NDC), includes both mainframe and mid-range systems and is currently located at MSFC in Huntsville, AL.   As part of an overall effort to improve operations and reduce both current and future costs, NASA/UNITeS is seeking information regarding the feasibility of commercially outsourcing the mainframe systems that are currently part of the NDC.  The potential outsourcing would include hardware, software and operations.  This RFI is intended to assist UNITeS in understanding commercial outsourcing can (i)satisfy unique NASA requirements, (ii) reduce costs and (iii) convert ongoing operational costs into a variable cost stream that directly reflects actual usage and capacity demands.  Please note that this RFI is an investigation into the feasibility and desirability of utilizing such an approach, this is not a procurement action.  All costs or expenses incurred to respond to this request shall be born solely by the respondent and are not reimbursable.  Should industry responses show that the approach is in fact operationally feasible and economically beneficial; a separate follow-on action to competitively acquire outsourcing services may be initiated.	Any decision to initiate such an acquisition shall be solely and strictly at the discretion of NASA. Since this is a market investigation and not a procurement action any pricing requested and provided shall not be considered an offer, but rather strictly a budgetary estimate.  However, it should be noted that budgetary pricing should be realistic as this is an important part of the evaluation and determination regarding the potential for a future acquisition.  All responses must be submitted to the address shown in the attached documents, and must be received no later than 5:00 PM CST, May 30, 2005.   All questions must be submitted no later than 05/02/2005.	Please direct all questions, comments and your response to the undersigned.

<SUBJECT>A -- Distribution of Mouse Models for Neural Tube Defects
<DESC>The National Institute for Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is considering an extension of our current contract with Jackson Laboratories for an additional five years, for maintenance and distribution of four mouse models for neural tube defects (NTDs).    At present, these models include the curly tail (ct), splotch (Sp), twist (Twistttm1Bhr), and forebrain overgrowth (fog) mutant mice. 
This project remains a priority area of the Developmental Biology, Genetics and Teratology (DBGT) Branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and contributes to multiple aspects of the Institute’s mission.  Continuation of this unique resource is critical to the Institute’s birth defect initiative, as it offers researchers supported by the NICHD reliable animal models for their investigations on NTDs. As will be described below, NTDs are the most common and most severe malformations of the central nervous system.  This contract also provides a resource to investigators interested in the genetics of developmental neurobiology, particularly central and peripheral nervous system development.    For the purpose of scientific integrity and consistency of research, these model mouse colonies must be acquired from Jackson Laboratory.   By extending the contract with The Jackson Laboratory, NICHD proposes to continue providing the services described in this document.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract extension.

CRITERIA FOR CONTRACT AWARD: Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation SOO, is determined to be the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offerors received, without discussions.  Proposal shall be in accordance with contractor's MOBIS GSA Schedule. 
 (a)  Basis for Award.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.
(b)  The Government will perform a trade-off analysis of non-price factors against price to determine the best value to the Government.  Offers that are unrealistically low in total price will be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk in meeting contract requirements and will not be considered for award.
(c)  Relative weight.  Non-price factors (Technical, Past Performance and Management), when combined, are more important than price.  Of the non-price factors, technical and past performance, which have equal weight, are more important than management.  The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase as the relative differences in non-price factors of offerors decreases.
(d)  Evaluation Factors.  In selecting the best overall value, the following factors will be evaluated:
(1)  Technical.  The proposed technical solution and approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of the extent to which the contractor’s solution will achieve DIA objectives.  Evidence of the quality of the technical solution and approach includes: (i)  Subfactor (1) – A comprehensive performance work statement and contract work breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet program and mission requirements set forth in the SOO.(ii)  Subfactor (2) – A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of proposed solutions will provide the various pre-employment functions necessary to ensure the agency can expeditiously and accurately process high-qualified personnel to meet hiring needs.	
(2)  Past Peformances.  Must demonstrate successful past performance on similar projects.  This factor will be used to determine the risks of non-performance, defective performance, and/or late performance by evaluating each offeror's reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of solicited services. In evaluating past performance, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided by the offeror and may contact other sources of information.  The Government may evaluate the past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors, predecessor companies, or key personnel who have relevant experience to the extent warranted.  Only relevant experience will be considered for past performance purposes.  An offeror with no record of relevant past performance will be given a "neutral" rating for past performance.  To assess reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type solicited services the offerors must submit at least four (4) sources, including contact name, phone number, contract number (if appropriate), project title and brief description of project.
(3) Management - Must demonstrate a level of knowledge, experience, and resources needed to complete the project to meet the Government's technical expectations in a timely manner.  Must have the ability to assign sufficient staff to perform the outlined tasks and have access to an array of advice from other knowledgeable staff, if necessary.
(4)  Price.
(e)  A definition of the evaluation ratings is as follows:
RATING DEFINITION
Excellent - The Contractor's proposal offers approaches/solutions that, if implemented, are expected to result in a superior achievement of the task in the Statement of Work with minimal risk.  An excellent rating indicates that the proposal contains significant strengths and has few or no weaknesses.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
