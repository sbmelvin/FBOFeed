<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Assistance for the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and other Interdisciplinary Training Projects

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), 1010 Wayne Avenue, Suite 920, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-1010, for a contract for: "Technical Assistance (TA) for the Leadership Education in Neurodevelopment Disabilities (LEND) and other Interdisciplinary Training Projects."  This is not a solicitation or a request for proposals.

In order for the "Leadership Education in Neurodevelopment Disabilities and other Interdisciplinary Training" program to be successful, the Contractor will need to provide specific supportive services and technical assistance services to approximately 35 Neurodevelopment Disabilities and other Interdisciplinary Training programs to help them improve and advance professionalism in caring for children with such conditions as developmental delay, mental retardation and congenital neurodevelopmental; and acquired neurological disorders. The tasks represent a further refinement on Leadership Education that the Contractor previously conducted for the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB).  AUCD, under traditionally funded Leadership Education grants, provided technical assistance and leadership to LEND training programs in identifying and addressing national issues related to children with neurodevelopmental and other related disabilities.

The decision to award the contract to AUCD is based on its long history of work with the MCHB and the Leadership Education grants.  AUCD gained extensive understanding and knowledge of the programs, expertise and experience with the myriad health, education, and social service agencies serving children with developmental disabilities.

In addition, AUCD has proven to have these exceptional essential tools to insure the success of the program.  Therefore, the Government has determined that AUCD is deemed the only responsible source capable to fulfill the requirement without substantial duplication of costs which would not be expected to be recovered through competition under the authority in 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a).  A Justification for Other then Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) is on file.  The contact person for this acquisition is:  Frantz Y. Richard, Division of Procurement Management, HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-0687; FAX 301-443-6038.  The electronic mailing address is: frichard@hrsa.gov.  See note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance (SSA), intends to award a sole source bridge contract for a period up to 12 months (including base period plus option periods) for centralized and comprehensive safeguards and security training for DOE.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1 (a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The bridge is required pending completion of a competitive follow-on acquisition.  The present contract with Wackenhut Services, Inc. will end on or about July 31, 2004.  No other firm has the requisite knowledge and experience that can assume the highly specialized technical training support without interruption on or about August 1, 2004. WSI has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security clearances.  This unique working environment necessitates the award of a sole source bridge contract to the incumbent contractor, Wackenhut Services, Inc.  The intent of this sole source procurement is to provide the required support services from August 1, 2004 until the award and transition of the follow-on acquisition.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the operation and maintenance of up to four Forward Deployable Radars (FDR) in support of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Under this effort, the contractor shall provide all operations and sustainment support that will include: radar operation, site survey and engineering services, preventative and corrective maintenance, administrative and physical security, spare parts, and personnel.  The period of performance of this contract consists of a five-year base period. Operational sites have not yet been determined, but will consist of OCONUS locations.  MDA intends to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with the Raytheon Corporation for these services, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1-(a)(ii): only one responsible source.  Raytheon, the developer of the FDR, currently has a CLS infrastructure in place that can support these radars within the required deployment schedule.  Utilization of any other source would result in unacceptable delays in deploying the radar to operational sites, jeopardize mission performance with new personnel inexperienced with the radar's design, operation, and maintenance, and would require substantial non-recurring training costs to enable personnel not familiar with the technology to understand its operation.  A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition is in process.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau for Near Eastern Affairs, Office of Partnership Initiatives announces an open competition for proposals for the design, production and distribution of “English Interactive Online,” to include supplementary e-learning English as a Foreign Language (EFL) curricula and materials for the Jordan Education Initiative (JEI) Discovery Schools program, in conjunction with the Ministry of Education in Jordan.

Successful applicants will be expected to coordinate closely with the Department of State Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and the Ministry of Education of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in the implementation of all aspects of this program.

The purpose of this program is to improve the quality of basic and secondary education in EFL, including teacher training, supplementary curriculum content and digital readiness, and to promote the development of employable skills in Jordan.  Specifically, this program will provide supplementary interactive EFL e-curricula for students whose first language of instruction will be Arabic, presenting grade-appropriate vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation training in a real-life context that places the student within a series of typical situations in which they are most likely to use the language skills they acquire.  The program will also provide teacher training and lesson plans for schools participating in the program.  Specific curriculum developed with the MEPI funds for this project will be available for use in the MEPI Partnership Schools Program across the region.

BACKGROUND:
The Government of Jordan has approached the Office of the Middle East Partnership Initiative for assistance in developing the Jordan Education Initiative Discovery Schools program.  JEI was launched in 2002 and added to the World Economic Forum, along with over twenty private companies, as a partner in 2003.  JEI Discovery Schools aim to modernize Jordan’s education system by enhancing curriculum, teacher training and methods, and expanding the use of broadband technology in the classroom.  

The Discovery Schools project meets the goals MEPI has established to improve the quality of basic and post secondary education in the Middle East, including teacher training, curriculum content, community empowerment, and digital readiness; expanding access to education, particularly at the basic and secondary levels, for all people, especially girls and women; and promoting the development of employable skills.   MEPI seeks to support those countries and governments already taking critical steps on their own to transform their education systems.  MEPI’s involvement in the Discovery Schools program will help produce educated youth with the skills necessary to contribute positively to their society and economy, as well as creating a model program for replication.  

English Interactive Online (EIO) will be a dynamic, interactive English-as-a-Foreign-Language course prepared in close cooperation with MEPI, the Jordanian Ministry of Education, JEI and its partners expressly for use by Jordanian students in grades 7-12 in a to-be-determined number of classrooms in the 100 Discovery Schools.  This dynamic online learning program will supplement Jordan’s existing EFL curricula and textbooks for grades 7-12 with online learning technology.  Together, these components will offer an innovative EFL solution to Jordanian students and teachers--one that will provide the Jordanian Ministry of Education the ability to make available a scalable, cost-effective, and curriculum driven learning program to a wide number of students, teachers, and schools.  The scope and sequence of EIO will pick up at the beginning of seventh grade and will dovetail with the existing Longman Action Packs curriculum for first through sixth grades.  The scope and sequence for EIO will be developed in partnership with the Ministry of Education and approved by the same before development begins.  EIO may be further developed for use in other countries in the Middle East region.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City,  intends to award a sole source contract to Engenuity Technologies, 2452 Del Prado, La Verne, California 91750 for the procurement of Control Alarm and Monitoring System (CAMS) Software Development Support. This acquisition is sole source for the following reasons.  The Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Vehicle was first delivered in 1984 and had a service-life design of 20 years. Currently, the Navy has a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the LCAC.  Under SLEP, the LCAC will enter the 21st century with markedly improved performance and an increased life span.  The Virtual Prototyping System (VAPS) developed by Engenuity Technologies as its present graphics generation tool are compatible with existing Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) equipment and are the only VAPS graphics generation tool that are 100% compatible with the ex isting LCAC SLEP equipment.  Use of another company’s VAPS graphics generation tool  may introduce new or change existing parameters that may do more harm than good to the LCAC system.  Failure of the LCAC system could result in loss of life as well as significant damage and maybe even loss of fleet assets.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to Engenuity Technologies.  All work will be performed on the Naval Support Activity  Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 541512 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.   FSC 7010 .  A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 5 Jul 04.

The completed project will provide a handbook for use by NRCS personnel as well as a training tool for use by NRCS and others.  The revised Chapter will provide modern guidance to NRCS field office level, technical professionals to understand and conduct hydraulic analysis and design a needed for NRCS conservation work.  Such work includes extensive use of closed conduit systems to convey irrigation water, storm water, and water borne materials, and analyses of natural, excavated, and structural open channels.  The revised Chapter will also absorb appropriate technical content from several existing documents and portions of documents that will be eventually cancelled or revised.  The revised Chapter will also relate and explain the underlying methods for two existing NRCS national software packages.  The revised Chapater will also add new material related to the analysis and design of irrgation piplines and appurtenances.  The Chapter should explain the appropriate uses and limitations of all methods and include numerous graphics, tables, charts, and solved examples to facilitate thorough planning and design for conveyance of water and water borne materials.  An example of a recently completed Chapter of a similar Field Handbook is availaable at:  http://www.info.usda.gov/CED/ftp/CED/neh651-ch10.pdf.

<DESC>The Office of Partnership Initiative, Bureau of Near East Affairs (NEA), Department of State, announces an open competition for proposals for the development, implementation, management, and oversight, of innovative, cost-effective approaches to enhance the quality and relevance of education in the Middle East, with an emphasis on primary and secondary education.  The Partnership Schools Program (PSP) is part of the President’s Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and is managed by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Office of Partnership Initiative (NEA/PI).  More information about MEPI can be found at www.mepi.state.gov.  For the full request for applications, click on Current Opportunities, then click on Partnership Schools Program. 

NEA seeks a partner(s) to design, plan, and execute the PSP, and other appropriate education reform initiatives, in cooperation with regional governments, and other interested parties.  The purpose of the program is to work with governments in the Middle East to respond to the critical need to modernize and upgrade elements of their national education systems, including:  standards and assessment, curriculum development; professional development; administration (management and training); parental involvement; community participation and private sector support; and, technology utilization.  Sector expertise and program implementation/management will be combined with government-to-government dialogue, led by NEA/PI, resulting in a robust program to enhance primary and secondary education in the Middle East.

BACKGROUND
MEPI’s objective is to support the transformation of regional educational institutions, with an emphasis on the primary and secondary levels, through the introduction and implementation of new and innovative techniques and technologies to enable schools and teachers to address the needs of students in the 21st Century.  In addition to government support, MEPI anticipates including the active participation and partnership of both public and private sectors, and the active engagement of civil society and parental groups, in the PSP.  MEPI anticipates developing and implementing creative, innovative alternatives for improving the quality of and access to education for children in the Middle East, within existing school systems/frameworks and built on priorities identified by the regional host government(s), in coordination with the Department of State/MEPI.  The goal of the PSP is to demonstrate to governments, businesses, and communities that truly “transformed” schools can produce educated youth with the skills necessary to positively contribute to their society and economy.   

MEPI has already laid the groundwork for this program, conducting general assessments of basic and secondary education systems in a number of countries in the region.  In addition, MEPI has begun dialogue and engagement with governments in Yemen, Oman, Tunisia, and Saudi Arabia.  Applicants should expect to build on the work and relationships already developed with those countries.      

NEA anticipates that 3 – 5 countries will be involved in the first year of the program.  Other countries in the region will also be engaged; under consideration are:  Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen, and possibly others.  The number of schools selected to participate in any country will depend on the priorities of the host government, the scale of implementation, and the availability of resources.

All program elements in the United States may be conducted in English.  Arabic or French translation and interpretation will be needed for the activities in the region.  The program will include appropriate public diplomacy and outreach activities, as necessary, to engage the public in the region.  
 
NEA/PI will have substantive involvement in this cooperative agreement award.  NEA/PI oversight of partner performance will include, but not be limited to, the review and approval of:  (1) the Sector Expert(s); (2) Strategic Plans and Recommendations, including proposed site visits and technical assistance activities and schedules; (3) all materials developed and proposed for dissemination, including priorities and strategies agreed to with host-country officials and representatives; (4) any private sector/NGO providers identified to implement the program, and (5) an evolving and responsive public diplomacy and outreach element.  NEA/PI is responsible for ensuring that funds are obligated only for countries eligible for assistance and will maintain vigilance to this end.

For more program information on the Partnership Schools Program, please contact:  Catherine Bourgeois, Education Pillar Manager, NEA/PI, 2201 C Street N.W., Washington, D.C., 20520, telephone: 202-776-8546, email: bourgeoisca2@state.gov.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Apache—Sitgreaves National Forests, Springerville, Arizona, is announcing a Request For Proposals (RFP) for Performance Based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Service Contract that provides the Government with an end-result project that significantly reduces the fuels in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) areas surrounding National Forests.  The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests comprise a significant portion of the largest contiguous Ponderosa Pine forests in North America.  Fire suppression efforts over the last hundred years has generated a breeding ground for very dense forests that were once characterized by 20-60 trees per acres, which now range from 300 to 3000 trees per acre.  This dramatic increase in fuel load per acre has resulted in forest conditions that are unstable and make the forests vulnerable to intense wildfires.  Biomass Management treatments are sought over a ten-year period to effect a landscape treatment that promotes a “healthier forest” by dramatically reducing the intensity of wildfire within the WUI.  To maximize efficiency of operation, this RFP is being offered under the Stewardship Authority granted in Public Law 108-7.  Stewardship authority allows for the treatment of small diameter residue (non-merchantable trees and slash) to be offset by the value of forest products authorized to be removed.  The Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) approach allows offerors to propose a variety of methods and applications to efficiently produce the quality end results.  The Government anticipates awarding a Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) with a Firm Fixed-Price for small diameter tree and slash removal; and a rate re-determination on the value of sawtimber over the life of the contract.  Award will be based on the successful offeror’s proposal that provides the best value to the Government with consideration given to past performance, submittal documentation to satisfy evaluation factors, and methods proposed to accomplish the work.  Market research has determined that the scope of this project is beyond the capability of small businesses.  However, the Government has included a requirement in RFP for offerors to comply with the small business sub-contracting plan.  The Small Business size standard is $5.0 Million under NAICS code 115310.  Pre-Proposal / Site Visits will be scheduled and announced in the RFP.  The Government anticipates conducting three separate site visits that will be representative of the level of effort required for Biomass Management on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests.  Attendance for the Pre-Proposal Meetings / Site visits is strongly encouraged, but not required.  Costs associated with the preparation of proposals and/or site visits are the sole responsibility of the offerors/parties to the procurement process.  The proposal package, maps, and specifications will be made available on or after March 3, 2004, and will be posted at (except maps and drawings – these must be requested in writing) http://www.fedbizopps.gov.   In order to be eligible for award of a Federal contract, Offerors must now be registered in the Central Contractor Registration System (CCR).  The template containing information necessary for registration can be found at  http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.  The Contracting Officer is Richard Salazar, Southwestern Region 3, Acquisition Management Director, Albuquerque, New Mexico.  No Telephone requests for proposal packages will be accepted.  You may request a printed copy of the proposal package by submitting the request by Fax to: (928) 333-6357 (or 6362).    The last day to request proposal packages shall be May 3, 2004.

STATEMENT OF WORK   Afghanistan Project Team Building:
Background:

This project is an HHS Secretarial Initiative for the Rabia-Balkhi Women’s Hospital  (RBH) in Kabul, Afghanistan.  The project’s primary goal is to establish a high quality OB/GYN residency program at RBH while serving as a leading institution for the training of MCH health care providers for Afghanistan.  Currently the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines are used as a template to address all three major components of the ACGME’s process, securing a physical environment conducive to supporting a residency program, upgrading the quality of care by addressing the “systems” issues within RBH, an upgrading the knowledge and skills of the present attendings while trying to include the current residents.  

Scope of Services:
The team realizes that the emergency response strategy, essential to success during the initial phase of the project, does not meet the needs of the project team currently. Operational strategies, short and long- range planning, internal systems, and leadership development are examples of the organizational needs required to transition the team into a long-term response mode quickly and successfully.

The vendor shall provide solutions to meet the needs of the Afghanistan Team. The following outline details proposed solutions over the next six months. Given the challenging nature of this project, the organizational needs of the team, and the international venue location, a six-month program is critical to achieve sustaining organizational results.

Afghanistan Team staff will provide: meeting space for leadership planning, logistical support and other relevant materials as needed.

Deliverables:

To develop strategic message for communication.
To train staff to sustain and enhance the above activities.

CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS:  Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.  To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they shall be able to provide public health emergency response strategies to the leadership of the Afghanistan Project team as it relates to the Afghanistan population.  The vendor shall be able to provide a framework of an organizational design of a long-term operational unit within the scope of Reproductive Health in an international environment.  This project is an HHS Secretarial Initiative for the Rabia-Balkhi Women’s Hospital (RBH) in Kabul, Afghanistan.  The project’s primary goal is to establish a high quality OB/GYN residency program at RBH while serving as a leading institution for the training of MCH health care providers for Afghanistan.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition & Logistics Division, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Photronics, Inc. for 2-Dimensional Metrology Photomask Grids.

***Sole source determination is based on the need for 2-Dimensional Metrology Photomask Grids.   Photronics has worked closely with NIST and SEMI in implementing the CAD designs and metrology features and no other company is currently able to offer these requirements.  These masks are to be written on 6 inch photomask blanks with the tight manufacturing specifications as detailed and are available by Photronics.

***The manufacturing of these photomasks to the specifications require a detailed set of GDS stream files with appropriate metrology and alignment marks as needed by the laser photomask writing tool.  The mask designs have all the required features for the Photronics mask writers.  A key element is the Photronics measurement tool and the measurements specified here can only be completed with their tool since the tool was previously calibrated to the NIST Linescale Interferometer.  This was an extensive set of calibrations and measurements which took approximately two years of development time to complete with further development of the analysis algorithms.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 24, 2004, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Specialized Technical Services (STS), 2794 Indian Ripple Road, Beavercreek, OH 45440 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that STS is the only company that has Low Profile Night Vision Goggles (LPNVG) that meet the Government's requirements.  Based on market research, other companies' night vision goggles are not low profile in design, do not incorporate a built-in heads-up display, do not have dual image tube capability, do not provide adequate depth perception for driving watercraft, and are not waterproof.  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the LPNVG defines this requirement and requires that the system be lightweight, compact for ease of use, and provide an abridged profile that reduces the neck strain on the user.  It must be simple to operate (by a soldier with minimal dexterity), and shall incorporate a low hardware profile configuration, a see-through capability, and a built-in Heads-Up Display (HUD). The system is worn during periods of limited visibility/darkness in order to enhance combat effectiveness. It uses multiple mounting capabilities (i.e., head harness, fixed mount, helmet strap, etc). The LPNVG system shall be a small, lightweight, ruggedized image intensifier (I²) system that incorporates GEN lll/GEN IV image intensifier tube technology. The system is used for target detection, recognition, identification and as a navigational aid.  The low hardware profile assembly shall not exceed a threshold size of 8 cm depth, and a weight threshold of 750 g. The see-through field-of-view shall afford a +15° to -80° inch vertical and 165° horizontal capability. The image intensified field-of-view is 40° in each monocular of the binocular goggle system. The HUD shall use a ¼ VGA active matrix twisted-nematic miniature LCD display in the beam combiner. The system must operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. Operating temperature range must be -30° C to 52° C, with the ability to function in humid environments of 95% relative humidity up to 49° C and capable of withstanding saltwater immersion to 10 meters. The Government also needs full logistics support for these items.  It is anticipated that the contract type shall be a five-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a maximum of $4,000,000.  See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. John Hayes at (813) 828-7504 or hayesd@socom.mil.

The President and Chief Scientific Officer of ImQuest BioSciences is Robert Buckheit, Jr., Ph.D., previously associated with the Department of Infectious Disease at Southern Research Institute (SRI) and TherImmune Research Corporation/Gene Logic Inc (TRC/GLGC). In March 2004, Dr. Buckheit Jr. moved with his HIV experience and capabilities and was joined at ImQuest BioSciences by key professional and technical staff who were associated with the previous years contract from TRC/GLGC. This research team re-established the retrovirus research program at ImQuest BioSciences.  The assay offerings of this new program are identical in all technical aspects to the previous year’s contract offering by SRI and TRC/GLGC. However, with the departure of Dr. Buckheit and key personnel, the scientific expertise to develop chemical chemotypes for the discovery of novel NCp7 inhibitors for the treatment and/or prevention of HIV transmission is now only available at ImQuest BioSciences.  During the last year, Dr. Buckheit has designed and directed Zn finger inhibitor specific projects that have allowed the selection of lead compounds for in vivo efficacy studies and helped to further define additional classes of NCp7 inhibitors.  Assignment of ImQuest BioSciences to this project will allow continuation of the last 2 years of research and ongoing experiments through direct access to the expertise of Dr. Buckheit and his scientific team.  To be required to recreate the expertise inherent in ImQuest’s management of this Zn finger project through Dr. Buckheit by another contractor would result in significant delays and expenditures to recreate this service. Thus, the continuation of progress with timeliness and efficiency requires continued usage of Dr. Buckheit and his group.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, without the introduction of new variables into ongoing experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI staff to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 2, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541380, Size Standard 6M

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>99--Joint Services Transportable Decontamination System - Small Scale (JSTDS-SS) Industry Day Questions and Answers Update
<SOLNBR>M6700404R0061
<CONTACT>Nannette D. Carter-Jafri (229)639-6166; Larry R. McNutt (229)639-8088
<DESC>DRAFT: Questions and Answers Joint Service Transportable Decontamination System—Small Scale  (JSTDS-SS) Industry Day 8 June 2004 Additional website information can be found at: UID Website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid CCR Website: http://www.ccr.gov NECO:  http://www.neco.navy.mil WAWF Registration: http://rmb.odgen.disa.mil/ You are invited to address any other questions to the Marine Corps Logistics Command, email to mcnuttlr@logcom.usmc.mil anytime before COB 4pm EST on Tuesday, 15 June 2004.  All questions should include the company name, address, CAGE code, and point of contact info including email address.  Information Purposes Only -All information provided prior to release of the final RFP is considered to be non-binding.  Comments provided by industry will be considered and included in the final RFP at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  The Govern ment is bound only by the information contained in the final RFP and its amendments. Questions & Answers: The Government reserves the right to defer answers until questions are properly staffed, therefore any question rendered not appearing below will be addressed and posted as soon as possible (ASAP). Legend:		Answers O	Other			7  (unchg) TS	Testing			9  (TS-9) TC	Technical		35 (TC-23 thru TC-35) L	Logistics		5  (unchg) C	Contract/Legal		19 (C-11 thru C-19) No.	Question & Answer TS-9	Q: How will reliability and availability be measured?A: Reliability is the probability that an item can perform its intended function under stated conditions for a specified period of time.  Reliability will be evaluated as follows: 1)Testing will be conducted for using the procedures and conditions specified in the service Concept of Operations.  2)Test length will be sufficient to de monstrate the 303 hour mean-time-between-operational-mission-failure (MTBOMF) requirement with high statistical confidence. 3)Test incidents will be scored using an approved Failure Definition and Scoring Criteria. 4)Failure data will be used to calculate the MTBOMF and reliability for each system.Operational availability, or Ao = uptime ¸ (uptime + downtime) where uptime is that time when the system is considered to be ready for use and downtime is the time the system is down for repair of critical failures and/or for restoration from mission critical faults, including off-board logistic delays.  Also, please consider the Mean Logistics Delay Time (MLDT) of 133 hours mentioned in the rationale for the JSTDS RAM to be a maximum MLDT calculation. ----------------------------------------------------------- TC-23	Q: At what distance from the unit is the sound pressure level (8 5dB) measured. A: The performance specifications state that noise levels produced by JSTDS-SS, excluding audible indicators, shall be less than 85 dBA to allow operation of the JSTDS-SS without hearing protection. Noise levels will be measured at distances of 18 inches from the control panel and one meter from the rest of the system, on all sides.   TC-24	Q: Why are you defining the process instead of the objective?  You are severely limiting your options.A:   The technical specifications and the Statement of Objective are performance based.   The JSTDS-SS RFP does not define the process other than to continue to have the capability to be able to apply hot soapy water for decontamination of aircraft and other equipment.  This capability is required based on market surveys which indicate that there are no Commercial Off-The-Shelf solutions that will meet the warfighters deconta mination needs for these assets as well as the time required to obtain approval for use of any new product on aircraft. User representatives presented current decontamination operations so that offerors would be in a better position to focus their proposals on how their proposed product/processes will provide benefit to the Department of Defense and mitigate the burdens shortfalls of current decontamination operations.  Offerors are required to identify in their proposal the processes followed to perform decontamination operations using their proposed system. TC-25	Q: Is a RAM document available?A:  No unique Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) document is available.  The performance specifications identifies in the concept of operations that mission duration equals 22 hours every 24 hours.  Mission duration allows 22 hours run-time (2 hours for refueling/prev entive maintenance).  Run-time includes the time to replenish decontaminants. The Operational Availability requirement notes that for calculation, Mean Logistics Delay Time is 133 hours.   TC-26	Q: In para 3.2.6 in performance specs – what do you mean by “standard components) (Military, industry, NATO, etc)A:  The JSTDS-SS shall use standard components and interfaces to the maximum extent possible.  “Standard components" refer to equipment that is not so uniquely designed that there is only one source for procurement or replacement (i.e., equipment should be available from commercial or military sources.)  No special tools or other specially-designed equipment (outside the Joint Services inventory) shall be required to remove, install, or replace the equipment. TC-27	Q: Are the materials to be tested for compatibility specifically listed in the RFP?A: No.  The requirement is  to be compatible with all materials on the assets to be decontaminated. The subset of materials to be tested against in Phase II testing will be identified in the final RFP.  JPO is deriving a representative set of materials to be tested.  The finished list will be comprehensive of all possible systems which may be exposed to JSTDS-SS, small enough to feasibly be tested and accepted by all services.  The materials not tested in Phase II testing will be tested after contract award. TC-28	Q: Can efficacy data on decontaminate be supplied as independent from spraying applicator or does efficacy data have to come from being sprayed from the actual applicator?A:  Yes, efficacy data can come from the decontaminant alone, however, convincing rationale needs to be provided to relate this data to the efficacy that can be expected from the proposed system using the proposed process. TC -29	Q: “52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” per paragraph A.(2)(f):   Is terrain decontamination included in the scope of this solicitation? If not, what is the significance of the reference to “amount of decontaminant required to decontaminate 1000 square meters…”A: The 1000 square meters technical parameter was inadvertently based on terrain decontamination.  This number will be modified to 5000 ft2 to be more representative of the mission of JSTDS-SS. TC-30	Q: “52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” A.(2)(j)1.:  What are the temperature requirements for hot soapy water?A: 120-140 degrees F.  This will be included in the Final RFP. TC-31	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraphs 3.1.1.5.1 and 3.4.3: Is it intended that the JSTDS-SS could be mounted on either the vehicle or the trailer of each of the listed vehicle/trailer combinations? If  yes, please provide the dimensions of the space available for the JSTDS-SS on board each of the vehicles and the respective trailers.A: The JSTDS-SS must be able to be mounted on each of the identified vehicles and trailers. Diagrams (which include dimensions) of those platforms with the smallest dimensions are in the Industry Day brief (which will be posted on NECO as soon as possible). TC-32	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.1.1.6.2: This references applying compounds to aircraft. Is this just a measure of throughput and not a decontamination performance spec? The Industry briefing on June 8th (verbal information) indicated that aircraft decontamination is objective requirement. Please clarify.A: Paragraph 3.1.1.6.2 of the performance specification is a throughput requirement.  The throughput requirement for aircraft is based on the rate of application and not  on decontamination efficacy.  It is an objective to provide a JSTDS-SS decontaminant for use on an aircraft to meet the efficacy requirements.   TC-33	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.2.2: Does the 500 lbs weight referenced include standard accessories? Optional accessories?A: No.  The 500 pounds is the maximum weight of the JSTDS-SS applicator module (without fuel) and does not take into consideration the JSTDS decontaminant or accessories. TC-34	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.1.1.4:  Does this mean that the decontaminant is required to be effective in removing POLs, or does it mean that the decontaminant must be effective in decontaminating agents (C,B,R, TIM, etc.) that are embedded in POLs?A: Offerors proposed system used in accordance with their proposed methods must be able to decontaminate tactical vehicles (including undercarriage),  external shipboard surfaces, crew–served weapons and individual equipment, which have been exposed to Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POLs). Agents may or may not be embedded in the POLs.   TC-35	Q: Under “PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION” Paragraph 3.7.2: The last four items listed are not climatic conditions.  What are the test parameters for these four items that the JSTDS-SS has to be measured to?A: The last four items are not climatic conditions but are ambient or induced environments that the system will need to operate in and/or survive.  The specific test parameters will be addressed in detail in the performance specifications included in the final RFP. ----------------------------------------------------------	 C-11	Q: 5 units 1 MAPO is aggressive.  Lead times for some commercial items can be 6-8 weeks.A; The delivery schedule will be modified in the final RFP to two units  due every two weeks beginning four weeks after purchase order, with final delivery no later than 12. C-12	Q: Please confirm the period of performance: July 2005-June 2010??A: The period of performance for the base contract is one year, with an estimated award date of 3rd qtr FY05 (July 2005).  There are four option years, with the final option year estimated to concluding by 2nd qtr FY10 (June 2010) based on the estimated award date. C-13	Q: Is the JSTDS-SS Program funded? What is the funding profile by fiscal year?A: The only publicly available budget information is in the Presidents Budget.   C-14	Q: Will bidder technical support be included in Purchase Order for DT/OT prior to contract award?A: Yes, if selected for Phase II.  Offerors should identify in logistical support available during Phase II for their system. C-15 	Q: Since logistics support is undetermined at thi s point and will be driven by the Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Business Case Analysis (BCA), how will contracting for this be handled?  Directed to successful JSTDS-SS bidder?A: Contractor must identify in their proposal Statement of Work their PBL.  Offerors contracting method to implement PBL will be assessed during the PBL BCA.  Also see L5 Q&A. C-16	Q: Will there be small business, small disadvantaged business and/or 8A set aside with this procurement?  Will there be subcontracting and teaming requirements and SB/SBD participation requirements?A: The Draft RFP does not identify total or partial set-asides for socio-economic programs.  However, the Final RFP will address requirement for offerors (large business concerns) to identify their Subcontracting strategy/plan I/A/W FAR 19.704.  Note: the subcontracting plan would become part of any contract award.  Final RFP wi ll be compliant with FAR Part 19, small business concerns are encouraged to submit their prime vendor proposals. C-17	Q: “52.212-2  EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS” Under “Phase I  Completeness of Proposal.”  The listing starts with items (k) through (s).  Are there items (a) through (j) that were inadvertently omitted?A: The paragraphs were numbered incorrectly.  There were no omissions.  The numbering will be corrected in the final RFP. C-18	Q: Will CLINs for the option years be included in the final RFP?  What are these option years CLINs?A: Yes, the final RFP will cover the base year, plus four option years. C-19	Q:  Is it acceptable to propose a JSTDS-SS system with more than one applicator and/or more than one decontaminant?A: Yes.  However, each JSTDS-SS system offered must have a complete proposal package (Volume I, II, and III).  All proposals will be evaluated based on  best value to the government.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any purchase order or contract.  The Department of Agriculture is seeking to identify sources capable of providing the following:  INTRODUCTION:  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Marketing and Regulatory Programs Business Services (MRPBS), Human Resources Division (HRD) is in need of a contractor/consultant to provide advisory services, identify business needs and conduct an organizational readiness assessment for an automated position classification system.
Presently, the classification function is a manual process and has been reviewed under the ISO9000 methodology for documenting and identifying potential improvements in the function.  The MRPBS HRD provides position classification services to the three agencies that comprise the Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP) mission area.  The agencies are Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA).  The mission area employs roughly 14,000 people in a variety of positions.  TRANSFORMING POSITION CLASSIFICATION AT MRP:  Prior to investing in an automated solution for Federal position classification, it is necessary to assess the Marketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP) position classification environment to ascertain feasibility and readiness given the customers’ needs.  The primary objectives of the assessment are to:
•	Review and validate the current ISO position classification process map for an understanding of the manner in which operational classification is carried out in the mission area.  
•	Survey the marketplace and research the tools available to automate the federal position classification function and provide us with their potential applicability to the MRP classification program.  
•	Contact other federal agencies for information related to their experiences with implementing an automated classification solution focusing on the primary functionality offered in using the tool, lessons learned, do’s and don’ts, and obstacles to overcome.
•	Provide insight into the MRP position classification technology readiness by conducting an assessment of tools in use today, their purpose, and their primary usage.    
•	Gather input/Interview individuals working in the operational and policy classification areas, HRD management, and program officials (customers) within the MRP mission area to gather various perspectives on what is needed/wanted in an automated position classification solution.  The plan for interviews will be developed once a contract has been let, but travel to various locations will be necessary due to the geographic disbursement of our mission area personnel.    Other interviews may be conducted over the phone.  
•	Assess the readiness and identify what is needed of the HRD to move toward an automated position classification environment
•	Prepare a baseline of the MRP position classification function including the organization, customer perception of the process, business processes, current technology utilization, timeliness and standards of service in order to build a framework for assessing/comparing the as-is process with the to-be process.   
•	Summarize the baseline processes and design a target business process that, when implemented, can result in significant improvements in performance and lay a foundation for change in the position classification arena.  The analysis of results will provide us with options and pros and cons for approaching an automated environment and outline various position classification automated tools available in today’s marketplace.
DELIVERABLES AND RESOURCES:  Deliverables for the assessment focus on providing insight into the current state of business as well as providing materials that can be used to clearly communicate the findings and opportunities available to management.  The following are the desired deliverables with the final assessment due 90 days after a formal contract is let.  You are to provide the estimated due weeks after start for each deliverable: Deliverable 1: Project Plan for conducting the assessment; Deliverable 2: Draft assessment report; Deliverable 3: Final assessment report.  All responses to this RFI should include:
•	description of services offered related to the objectives stated above;
•	general timeframes to meet objectives;
•	price list or cost estimates; and
•	other information deemed necessary for this request.

All information contained in this RFI is preliminary and subject to modifications and is in no way binding on the Government.

Responses to this RFI are to be submitted BY 2:30 P.M. CST, July 2, 2004, to Margie Thorson, Contract Specialist, by either email to margie.p.thorson@aphis.usda.gov, or fax to Area code (612) 370-2106, or mail to: USDA, APHIS, MRPBS-ASD, Contracting, Butler Square West, 5th Floor, 100 North Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN  55403.

<SUBJECT>99--AIRCRAFT SHUTTLE PASSENGER SERVICE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<SOLNBR>3686
<RESPDATE>072004
<CONTACT>Jerry Hendricks, (609)485-6766
<DESC>AIRCRAFT SHUTTLE PASSENGER SERVICE ***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** This Request for Information has significant changes compared to the previous RFI issued on April 23rd, 2004. Note: This is a Request for Information Announcement. Information provide by interested parties will be considered confidential or privileged and will not be released in accordance with FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b) 4.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is requesting information from qualified businesses associated with NAICS code 48111 Titled â€œ Scheduled Passenger Air Transportationâ€. The WJHTC is hereby requesting information to assist in determining if the Governmentâ€™s requirement needs enhancement for future procurements and to determine current commercial industry capabilities. ** The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center is currently under contract with an Aircraft Charter operator for shuttle passenger service between ACY (Atlantic City International Airport, NJ) and DCA (Ronald Reagan National Airport, Washington, DC). Normal schedule of passenger movement is eight (8) round trips per week (Tuesday thru Friday). ** The WJHTC intends to issue a Request for Proposal at some time in the future.  Attached to this RFI is a sample statement of work for that document and a schedule. Interested parties are invited to provide information to assist the government in preparing a final statement of work consistent with commercial practices and capabilities. WJHTC desires to afford maximum opportunity for contractors to provide comments.  From those comments, the government will tailor a final statement of work that allows for innovation and efficiency within the parameters of the governmentâ€™s need and request proposals. Following proposal evaluation, the government expects that the resultant contract will be a Firm-fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity award for a base year with four one year options. The following two (2) factors will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. The combined technical criteria (elements a, b, and c) may be considered more important then the price criteria. 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH: a. Backup/Contingency Plan: The WJHTC requires both on-time performance and actual completion of all round trip flights. The offerors shall address plans to provide the required services contained in the attached SOW and shall offer solutions for mitigation of any breaks in service due to the fault of the contractor at both ACY & DCA locations. Mechanical failures shall be considered the contractorâ€™s fault. Circumstances beyond the contractorâ€™s control (weather, air traffic control delays etc) are not considered to be the contractorâ€™s fault. Subcontracting flights to mitigate cancellations or lateness is authorized, however, background checks must have already been performed on those pilots. This element will have a 5-page limit (8x11 paper with 12 font size or smaller). b.  Type of Aircraft & Age of Aircraft:  The offeror shall provide the age of the Aircraft they propose to use for this passenger shuttle service. The government will apply higher scores in the source selection process for newer aircraft verse lower scores for older aircraft. c.  Past Experience:  On-time reliability is very important for the FAAâ€™s shuttle program. Provide examples within the last 5 years of similar passenger shuttle service experience that the offeror has provided that have resulted in an ongoing relationship with the customer(s). These examples shall indicate the competency the WJHTC can expect from the contractor performing the effort. Provide name, address, POC, Ph#, description of dates of service rendered, and verifiable data demonstrating on-time performance history. This element will have a 10-page limit (8x11 paper with 12 font size or smaller). 2. PRICE PROPOSAL: Price Proposal:  Offerors are requested to provide price per trip, each round trip and totals. The offerors pricing shall include all price elements associated with operation of this passenger shuttle service including, but not limited to insurance, taxes, fuel, subcontracting, maintenance, labor and profit. Interested parties responding to this Request for Information should address issues in the statement of work and identify those that may even lead to processes that are uneconomical or not in accordance with commercial business practice. All questions/inquiries must be provided by e-mail only, to Jerry Hendricks at jerry.hendricks@faa.gov., no later than July 8th, 2004. Proposals are due no later than July 20th, 2004 2:00PM. This Request for Information does not commit or obligate the William J. Hughes Technical Center to issue any future documents.      ** Please see Attachments ( SOW and Schedule )**

<DESC>The Ogden ALC Space and C3I Directorate, AF Tactical Shelter & Radome Program Office (OO-ALC/LHH) at Hill AFB, UT is seeking sources that can provide all the necessary electrical and structural design work, manufacturing, and RF testing for a next generation of large ground-based advanced composite radomes for various radar systems, including the WSR-88D and the AN/FPS-124.  Of utmost importance is that this next generation of radomes be designed with materials that have appropriate dielectric constants that, coupled with the radome design, yield very low transmission losses.  Also of very high importance is that these radomes have hydrophobic properties such that water will bead on the radome surface instead of sheeting.  Additionally, these radomes should not require painting, should not delaminate, and should be able to be used in various radar systems, as listed previously, by making slight alterations (e.g. changing panel thickness) in the design.  
Potential sources are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities by 4:00 p.m. Mountain Standard time by 19 July 2004 to the following address:  Tactical Shelter/Radome Program Office, OO-ALC/LJHH, 6021 Gum Lane, Bldg 1228, Hill AFB, UT 84056. Submissions should be limited to 10 pages and should be specific in outlining source's capabilities to produce large ground based radomes that increase the life cycles and decrease the maintenance of current panels in use by the Air Force today.
Note: This is a sources sought synopsis only, not a request for proposals (RFP), and this is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals, nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. No proprietary data should be submitted in response to the synopsis. Any submissions will be considered to be public information and may be handled by non-government personnel.

Large Ground-Based Advanced Composite Radomes for Various Radar Systems with Increased Life Cycles and Decreased Maintenance
Purpose:
The AF Tactical Shelter & Radome Program Office (OO-ALC/LHH) requires significant improvements in the design of current radomes used in the WSR-88D and AN/FPS-124 radar systems.  In general, such improvements should increase the life cycles, decrease the required maintenance, and reduce the cost of manufacturing of these radomes.  Specifically, such improvements should include requiring no painting and reducing or eliminating delamination of radome panels while meeting all RF, structural, and environmental requirements of said radar systems. 
Please uploaded file for futher details.

<SOLNBR>Re:04HQ11-NoSolicitation
<RESPDATE>070204
<ARCHDATE>06182005
<CONTACT>STACEY DIAMOND CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487309     sdiamond@usgs.gov;
<DESC>For more information regarding this sources sought, see 04HQ11-NoSolicitation. This is a list of the question and answer session from the Pre-RFI conference on June 2, 2004 at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado regarding the Warehouse Distribution and Product Sales. Note: Proposals are due July 2, 2004 at 4PM EDST and can be sent to inventoryRFI@usgs.gov. The Q&A Session as follows: Introductions Current State of Warehouse Distribution Operations (Ron Lofton) Natural Science Network (Hedy Rossmeissl) The National Map (Richard Kleckner) Warehouse Tour After today, send inquiries to:  inventoryRFI@usgs.gov Q&A Session Q:  How do you handle your mail and internet orders?  Who do they come to and how are they processed? A:  Store.USGS can search and order on line.  Mail is processed daily.  Complete process happens in Denver. Q:  Are all those order methods still going to be used in the future?  Do you anticipate phasing anything out? A:  Ideally we would like to continue with all existing methods.  Internet ordering is expanding, so the other methods may slow down, but there will always be those without computers. Q:  Is the storage only in Denver?  Does this include the storage in Rolla? A:  Map separates are in Rolla, but are not part of this program.  Denver is the only warehouse. Q:  Half of what you send out is no charge to other government agencies.  How do you think that will work?  Will this change with the contract?  A.	There will be a component of that.  As a science agency, we have an obligation to provide/distribute information relating to our 4 disciplines.  Subsidy of some sort is anticipated.  More and more free prods are available on the internet.  We are looking for ideas.   Q:  Library/federal depository program-the same situation (as above).  Will this change? A: We have had recent conversations with GPO.  As more materials become available on web, this helps to meet that requirement of giving depositories new product.  We will continue to be proactive in working with the depository community as they, and we evolve. Q:  On the National Map-data production will be shifted from government toward private sector.  How will it be kept private domain? A:  We can use a contract mechanism.  And becomes part of the USGS/public domain data set. Material made and delivered by the private sector is a little touchier.  One thing we'd like to do - ability to view data through National Map but not download during a specific time frame.  If ortho imagery, for example, for first year it has value for private sector and can be avail for viewing but can be purchased from private sector.  After a couple years when information has lost its initial value due to newer information, the private sector would turn the product over for public domain. Licensing and use restriction aspect is the big challenge. Q:  What is the actual topic of the RFI - what is inside the box, what is outside the box?  Farm out components and be subsidized by govt??  Are you looking for someone to take over everything that goes on? A:  The RFI is to gather information from all of you-business models, technology, innovation.  We don't want to project specific ideas or direction, we want your input. Q:  Sensitivity to displaced employees, site-specific, other considerations-should this be addressed in response to RFI?  Has any thought be given to employee performance?  Is there a continuity of need or site specific information? A:  Reference the Natural Science Network presentation-we are interested in keeping a core staff of information providers, not in the area of sales of products.  With the new technology everything is open, not site specific. Q:  Once responses are received, how will this play out? A:  A team will look at all responses.  We'll craft a Request for Proposal.  We need you to help us figure out what is needed.  Beginning of new fiscal year (September, October) is tentative RFP date.   Q:  Will the draft go out for comment? A:  Possibly. Q:  If current product prices are set by Congress or management, would a commercial model have more flexibility?   A:  We set out fees based on costs for printing and distribution.  We've been told prices are too low.  Current Business Partners can set any price structure they want.  We don't put a requirement on them.  In the new environment, we anticipate a similar situation.  We will look at it from a more reasonable factor; maybe have a review process on the prices.  If we are no longer distributing hard copy, litho, topo maps, then we can't set a price for what we don't distribute.  We will not be in competition with the private sector.  We have other products beside topo maps; we could use contractual arrangements to arrive at those prices.  Other federal agencies dictate their prices to us, and we'll have to work with those partnerships to determine prices.  On book products, we get prices from GPO-we don't set those prices.  We would need to take everything into consideration and this could be a complex distribution model. Q:  NOAA is outsourcing to India.  Do you anticipate USGS outsourcing for map products, software? A:  Through current mapping contracts with Mid-Continent and Rolla, we have 7 primes that we can go to for various task orders.  Only 1 has off-shore outsourcing opportunities.  That's all we're aware of for now.  Is it a trend for the future?  We don't know.  We do have a few foreign business partners also. Q:  Are there restrictions on outsourcing? A:  Not that we're aware of. Q:  You distribute for other agencies products-would this all be under one MOU to distribute products? A:  That's how we envision it.  We'll have to work with our other agencies to work this out.  We would need to see if NGA will continue to want to work with us.  Q:  During the warehouse tour we noticed many prods didn't fit the conventional map line.  Will all product lines be included?  Are we trying to cover everything under one big umbrella? A:  We're required to cover everything you saw in the warehouse.  We're looking for your input as to how to handle this.  RFI does allow for a response to targeted areas.  Your input will help us determine what kind of interest there is.  Maybe different contracts for different product lines? Q:  Do you have a Homeland Security budget? A:  As of now, we have received no funds.  There is an MOU that USGS has developed with Dept of Homeland Security, which was signed by Secretary Norton.  It is floating around DHS while various groups try to determine who will sign. Lots of internal politics.  Who will have responsibility for this?  Homeland Security will use National Map for their base data sets. Q:  With decreasing sales, it is a daunting task to be asked to take over the inventory.  Is there a long term plan for FAA to supply printing as needed? Or is this the distributor's responsibility? A:  Current relationship with FAA-they print requirements as we need.  Print on demand is an on-going issue.  This relationship may change in time as needs change.  Trend is for less paper product over time. Q:  If an entity took over the warehouse, can they pick and choose products and quantities of products? A:  We are looking to downsize the complete holdings.  Efficiency is paramount.  Downsizing will happen but emergency supplies need to maintained.  A variety of proposals could be made-that ALL go out, that somebody has the capability to supply map on demand of low sellers, for example.  Suggestions are needed for other models.  Q:  How many are selling less than 5/month, etc.? A:  Slide presentation shows high sellers, low sellers, demand information.  John will have graphic map made for those who want it. Q:  You named 49 government employees and 21 contractors.  As part of downsizing, are 21 contractual employees phased out or relocated?  Will they lose their jobs? A:  Five year contract is renewable every year, with a 30 day terminate clause if needed.  Efficiency is always being looked at.  If a different approach works, we'll not have contract employees.  Another buyout is a future possibility for the government employees. Q:  Our capabilities for that transition period, we would put together a team to evaluate, come on site, do a workup package-do you think we'll have the opportunity to do that?  To carefully evaluate the inventory?  And supervise the physical move to our facility? A:  Yes, a transition period would be part of the package. We will be looking for a way of shifting products and positions without impacting customers.   Q:  49 staff is in addition to contract workers? A:  Yes, that is the total Branch of IS. Q:  If stock is handed over to private entity, what money is transferred?  Would they pay some fee for those physical items?  Is there a cost for those products? A:  That will be part of the negotiation.  There are many options out there.  How does the inventory itself factor into the future state?  Emergency response responsibility factors in to how this is settled. Q:  You have a history with your customers-how do you see having your contact with customers taken away from you?  How will the customers feel? A:  We'd like to see a seamless transition.  We'd still like to have a close relationship with our customers.  We've done a lot to build those relationships.  It's going to be very challenging.  Maybe ownership, stewardship still resides with USGS. (Ron's presentation was handed out) Q:  This proposal is limited to a 10 page response-are there specs you'd like (format, electronic?) A:  Electronic form preferred.  Send to e-mail address. Q:  Copies of presentations? A:  Yes, they'll be electronically available.  Probably out by tomorrow. Q:  Performance based contracting? A:  Contracts answered, yes, this would be.  This implies USGS will contract out for the services.  But it also implies private sector could just take over these activities.  Contacting is an OPTION.  It is wrong to assume we will be contracting out. An agreement is an option.  Because of some cost programs to the government, we may need some quality standards. Q:  There is clearly an order processing system and inventory control system used today.  Could we get access to the data?   A:  Yes, it will be available. Q:  RFI says USGS will not compete with contractor.  What data will be available free? A:  EROS Data Center handles NED, ortho imagery, land cover, and NHD will continue to be available.  Downloads are free.  Hard copy has a cost.  Digital information will always be available over the web.  Free of charge.  If you as a private entity wish to download and repackage that data to make it more useful, you are quite welcome to do that.  File sizes are limited to 1 gigabyte that you can access and download.  Must be downloaded in "blocks." Q:  Don't you see that as competitive?  (downloading and enhancing information) A:  In one way it could be.  EROS data center files--Each of those data sets are held individually.  Much work must be done with these files to integrate them to come up with a geographic representation.  USGS will provide high resolution DRGs for download.  Eventually.  Many data sets are unavailable at this time.  Colorado is on the schedule.  Texas, Delaware, Hawaii scheduled for next year.  Timetable depends on funding and results of this RFI.  We don't intend to replicate something that's already been done (some higher resolution scanning has been done and we don't plan to rescan those). Q:  Elaborate more on The National Map viewer pointing to other resources that sell the data.  Will that be an open catalog of providers or only the company rewarded the RFP? Open or sole source? A:  This won't necessarily be a contract, sole source or whatever.  We may just rely on the private sector to provide that service.  How this will work is yet to be determined. People will sign up for value added products agreements. Q:  National Map funding-where is this coming from?  Who is funding development? A:  We're all paying for it.  Dollars are appropriated dollars.  We're a line item in the budget for The National Map.  All 3 of our programs support The National Map.  Carto/top program is the largest of the 3.  Vast majority of $80 million is directed toward The National Map.  Archiving, research, etc.  Funded by Congress through appropriated dollars.  We do leverage other dollars; have funding partners that help cost share.  Also have reimbursable income, such as map sales, and cost share with other government agencies. Q:  These 1200 retail outlets, how will RFP winner deal with them?  Will they have to deal with them? A:  The Business Partner program is a good vehicle and has value to the survey.   We would like to manage this program during the transition.  We need to do this right to meet everyone's needs.  Review process of this proposal is critical.  At what point does is lessen our effectiveness.  This will be very challenging. Questions to inventory RFI@usgs.gov.   The proposals are due by  4PM EDT on July 2.     Q:  For final proposal, should subject line be specific? A:  Yes.  Use for subject line:  Final Proposal and Name of Your Company.  No more discussion sessions, such as todays, are planned.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting a market survey to determine industry’s capability to deliver non-lethal capabilities embedded in a small, lightweight, and man-portable device. Capabilities of interest are: the application of non-coherent and impulse sources of light, aversive sound, and blunt-force trauma used individually or in combination to create a distracting or disorienting effect. The effect of the device will be non-lethal (not intended to cause death or permanent injury/damage) and temporary in nature.  It will significantly reduce undesired injury by assisting the warfighter in moving opposing forces out of a room or other similar type enclosures without using lethal force.     This will reduce risks in both noncombatant and combatant casualties, friend or foe and damage to collateral equipment and structures.
OPERATIONAL CONCEPT:
The intent of this non-lethal device is to minimize risk of undesired injury to the warfighter and noncombatants, neutralize space occupants (both combatant and noncombatant) through use of distraction / disorientation effects, and enhance force protection capabilities. The device will be utilized during combat operations, operations other than war (OOTW), ship seizures, hostage rescues or similar Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) where there is a requirement to clear individual spaces of enemy and non-combatant personnel, and to enter and control the targeted space.
 
RESPONSES: Products that are commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) or readily available COTS products requiring minor modifications may meet the criteria. Products that are still in research and development or that require significant modifications to meet the criteria are NOT acceptable. Interested firms are requested to respond by 16 July 2004 with a Capability Statement of no more than 10 pages outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement. Interested sources should send all hardcopy Capability Statements to: Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, ATTN:  IWS (Maj R. A. Hollen), Quantico, VA 22134 or electronically (Microsoft Word 2000 format only) via email to: hollenra@mcsc.usmc.mil   Be advised, electronic attachments may not penetrate the Marine Corps Systems Command firewall. Firms are encouraged to confirm receipt of submissions by e-mail. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEM/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>This sources sought is a request for information prior to drafting and releasing any resultant solicitation. The information contained in this sources sought notification is based on the best and most current information available to date, is subject  to change, and is not binding on the Government.  Any significant changes will be provided in subsequent synopsis, if required. The Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) has been tasked by the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to assume management and control for all common-user International Standards Organization (ISO) containers and other IS O equipment (ISO flat racks, special containers, etc) from the point at which the container enters the Defense Transportation System (DTS) until it is returned to the non-Department of Defense (DoD) user or, if DoD owned, to a DoD-controlled container  poo l.  A key capability to enable SDDC to perform the container management mission is the ability for users at all levels to obtain information through a single, reliable, accurate and timely source of in-transit visibility (ITV), total asset visibility (TAV)  and container/asset management through web-based technology; for users at all levels to be able to input data directly through the internet; and for users at all levels to be able to construct their own ad hoc queries through the internet.   SDDC requires the capability to track these containers through the DTS.  Containers are further defined as carrier-owned, government-leased, government-owned, and unit-owned.  The functional requirements for a proposed service will focus on carrier-owned, government-leased, and government-owned containers.   The initial focus of the tasking from USTRANSCOM is to control and manage the movement of containers into and out of the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) (see below for a list of countries).  In order to control and mana ge containers, SDDC requires the capability to track containers through two portions of the DTS pipeline:  Strategic and Theater.   The Strategic portion begins when the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) or other wholesale supplier creates a release order to fill a requisition and begins the process of creating shipping documentation and a booking request. The actual tracking requirement for the Strategic portion begins at the point where the containers enter the DTS (normally at the loading dock of a supply a ctivity or commercial vendor) to the point where they fall under Theater control. Containers in the Strategic portion of the pipeline are under the direct control and management of SDDC.   Containers enter the Theater pipeline at the designated point (depending on situation), are delivered to the final destination, and are returned to Strategic control or to their non-DoD owner.  This point of entry may be as far back as the Port of Debarkat ion (POD) or as far forward as the ultimate point of consumption depending on the security and tactical situation in that particular theater.  These containers are under the direct control of the respective Theater, but fall under the overall management of  SDDC.   Potential strategic users include:  USTRANSCOM, DLA, SDDC Headquarters and Command Operations Center.   Potential operational users include:   Theater movement and material managers, SDDC Groups and Ports.   Potential tactical users include:   Movement Control Battalions (MCBs), Movement Control Teams (MCTs), SDDC Ports, DS units operating Supply Support Activities (SSAs) and/or their equivalents operated by contractors.  Countries in the CENTCOM AOR: Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Seychelles, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan If you are interested in competing for this requirement, please indicate your interest  by sending an e-mail no later than  02 July 2004 4:00PM EDT to Janet Szatmary at szatmaryj@sddc.army.mil.  The e-mail shall contain the following subject line: Ã¢Â€ÂœSources Sought Response to Container Management ITV Capability.Ã¢Â€Â  Use of any other s ubject line may delay your entry.  All valid e-mail responses from prospective sources must provide the return e-mail address, company name, mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and point of contact within the body of their response.  In ad dition, to assist in the acquisition strategy development, please respond to the following questions:   1) Is your business a large business or small business?  (For the purpose of determining your business size, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), 517410 Satellite Communications, with a size standard of $21.0M average annual receipts over the past three years, will be utilized for this acquisition.) 2) Provide a list of customers (Government/non-Government) within the past 5-year highlighting similar work performed.  Include contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact/addresses/and phone numbers and brief de scription of the work performed.  3) Provide information relative to past performance that demonstrates the ability to provide ALL capabilities noted below that includes, but is not limited to:  a) The required capability would be used to accomplish the requirements listed below. This list is  not all-inclusive.  o	Provide ITV for shipments that are en route o	Status of a particular requisition o	Last reported location of a particular container o	Total shipments en route of a particular item o	Total shipments of a particular item delivered to a single or multiple consignees in a given date range o	Total containers delivered to a single or multiple consignees in a given date range o	Current detention status by location, by consignee, by carrier or owner, and by when detention charges will or did begin. b)	Web-based application approved for use in DoD architecture or able to gain approval for such use. There should be no requirement to develop any unique government-owned software application to gain access to the application.  Users should be able to acce ss the application with defined access rights and passwords.  The proposal to meet this capability should be in compliance with all applicable DoD security regulations, including DoD Directive 5200.28, Security Requirements for Automated Information System s (AIS), and should be able to be accessed despite firewalls.  c) Initially, this capability will provide the ability to manage and control carrier-owned containers, government-leased containers, and government-owned containers into, through, and out of th e CENTCOM AOR and should have the option to expand functionality to include global coverage.  d) Any solution must have the capability to accept input from various commercial and DoD sources and organize them into a user-friendly format.  For example, ther e is the potential to receive data from the systems identified below from up to 35 military or contractor operated movement control teams in Iraq and Kuwait and many more throughout the entire AOR. Please include any experience with the following systems: Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions, Extensible Markup Language (XML) transactions, Integrated Booking System (IBS), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and ITV server data, Worldwide Port System (WPS), Automated Management System (AMS), Excel  spreadsheets.  d) This solution must have the capability to consolidate existing data and files.  These files include government-owned, government-leased, and carrier-owned spreadsheets and other existing media documenting container status information. e) The solution mu st have the capability to be queried by users at all levels.  Also, users should be able to submit updates, such as container status (full, empty, current locatio n, date, etc.), in an automated manner.  This can include through such means as on-line or web-based forms, or through specifically formatted spreadsheets that are sent to a central repository, processed automatically, and then sent to a database.  f) Dete ntion charges are incurred when containers are not returned to the non-DoD owner in a timely manner.  The owners of the containers submit charges to SDDC.   Proposals must have the capability to provide an automated analysis of detention charges for accura cy and to validate or dispute the charges.  For the carrier-owned containers, the owners will submit detention charges in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Services Contract. g) The solution must have the capability to generate automated noti ces and reports, including status and location of all carrier-owned, government-leased, and government-owned containers in the DTS; detention charges; and transportation and ITV reports (for example, showing all containers due-in to a particular port) for automated forwarding via email to consignees/service POCs and Command Operations Centers of containers that are approaching or incurring detention charges. The users will designate criteria, types and frequency of reports. h) Containers may be individually  tracked in the future.  Proposals must have the capability to accept data from possible future tracking devices (active RFID tags, satellite tracking tags) and the supporting Automated Information Systems (AISs) and process this information accordingly. 4) Other pertinent information.   E-mail responses without the aforementioned information will not be recognized as valid.  ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST RESPOND TO THIS SYNOPSIS VIA E-MAIL.  TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR RETURNED.  Submit responses no later than 02 July 2004 4:00 PM EDT.  Your response is limited to 20 pages. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  The government reserves the right to conduct vendor oral capabilities demonstrations possibly to be scheduled at a later date. This is not a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice or to pay for any information received.

<SUBJECT>Q -- NHSC Student/Resident Experiences and Rotations in Community Health Program
<DESC>This notice is for a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) requirement for medical care related services for the National Health Service Corps(NHSC).  The requirement will be competed pursuant to the Public Health Services Act(PHSA), Title VII Health Professions Education, Part C, Sections 747- Training in Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine, General Pediatrics, Physician Assistants, General Dentistry, and Pediatric Dentistry, and 748- Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry.  Therefore,   the competition for this requirement will be limited to State Government Organizations or non-profit hospitals, schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, or public/private non-profit/not-for-profit entities.  It is anticipated that multiple contract awards may be made as a result of this solicitation.  Each proposed award will provide funding for approximately the equivalent of 1.33 Federal Time Equivalent(FTE).   

The NHSC ensures access to primary and preventive health care service in underserved communities and vulnerable populations through recruitment and retention of primary health care professionals.  Vulnerable populations are defined as frontier, rural and urban underserved areas.  The Student/Resident Experiences & Rotations in Community Health (SEARCH) is a part of the NHSC program.  The purpose of the proposed contracts are to obtain/provide continued support for SEARCH services from these individuals to strengthen healthcare in underserved communities through continued linkage between and among community-based State Government Organizations or non-profit hospitals, schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, or public/private non-profit/not-for-profit entities and academic institutions throughout the United States and its territories.  

The SEARCH Program will: 1) continue the facilitation and strengthening of the community-based organizations and the academic institution links(these links are  mutually beneficial and a benefit to society as a whole); and 2) continue to expand upon already established Statewide partnerships and relational infrastructures including State Primary Care Associations(PCA), State Primary Care Offices(PCO), Offices of Rural Health(ORH), professional associations, academic institutions, and Area Health Education Centers(AHECs) to form a network of organizations to meet the diverse primary care needs of the underserved;  3) provide opportunities for students and residents to train in interdisciplinary teams; 4) nurture the development of culturally competent, community responsive primary care providers; and 5) increase the recruitment and the retention of health care professionals in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by expanding the number of high-quality service-linked training opportunities available in these communities.

The period of performance is planned to be a base year with two one(1) year option periods.  Interested public or non-profit hospitals, schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, or  public or private non-profit entities, may request a copy of solicitation number HRSA-04N-230-5015mc via email.  Please reference the solicitation number and send to Mario Checchia at the email address:  mchecchia@hrsa.gov .

<SUBJECT>A--ADVANCED AIR GROUND COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS FOR AIR TRAFFIC SERVICES
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICIATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. In responding to this notice, please refer to “Advanced Air Ground Communications Concepts for Air Traffic Services” or NNC04PRA001.  Send information/literature/qualification statement no later than July 19, 2004 to the e-mail or postal address as provided herein.  NASA does not intend to award a contract based on this information.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to provide information relative to the goals set forth below. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information about advanced concepts in future air-ground communications systems for potential use in providing air traffic services (ATS).	For the purposes of this RFI, ATS includes the following services: separation assurance; air traffic control advisory; traffic management synchronization; navigation; airspace management; emergency and alerting; flight planning; infrastructure/information management; and traffic management strategic flow.  Transition to this future system would begin in the 2015 – 2020 time period, and the useful life of the system should be at least 20 to 30 years.   The information received from this RFI will be used by NASA GRC in support of a collaborative Future Communications Study between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Eurocontrol.	The FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study will help to define and design a global air-ground communications system that provides for world-wide interoperability among all ATS users.  The work plan and associated terms of reference for the FAA/Eurocontrol Future Communications Study can be found at http://www.eurocontrol.int/faa-euro/AP-group-meetings/ap17/ap17.htm   NASA GRC is responsible for Technical Theme 3 in the Future Communications Study work plan, to investigate new technologies for mobile communication.  This RFI is intended to provide input for conducting Task 3.1, Technology Pre-screening.  The Advanced Engineering & Sciences Division of ITT Industries, Inc. is under contract to assist NASA GRC in the technology pre-screening task.  They and other contractors of NASA and the FAA will have access to the information submitted for the purpose of conducting the technology pre-screening process.   NASA GRC seeks information on candidate system solutions for mobile communications that can be used for ATS both domestically and internationally.  Both current capabilities (based on existing or planned products) and potential future concepts are encouraged in response to this RFI.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-04-Q-625807 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposal being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  The NAICS is 721110.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.

****The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Parties may submit a quote.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) Ultra High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope (UHV STM).  The UHV scanning tunneling microscope must be capable of sub 10x-10 torr operation.  The STM must be capable of routine atomic imaging on reconstructed silicon surfaces and metal surface atomic resolution.  The STM must be upgradeable to variable temperature operation with drift control as an option at the time of purchase. 




All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line item:

****LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Ultra High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope (UHV STM) with the following required elements and specifications:

1.	Overall specification
a.	The tunneling current must be capable of routine operation in the range of 1 pA – 300 nA.
b.	The STM must be further capable of operating and imaging with a tunneling current of less than 1 pA.
c.	Tunneling current noise is a critical performance parameter.  The noise on the tunneling current must be less than 0.1 pA.
d.	The STM needs to have a software-controlled internal switch allowing the dynamic range to be switched between 3 nA and 300 nA operation range.
e.	The STM must be capable of modulation spectroscopy, which uses the Lock-In technique to directly measure dI/dB. The modulation frequency must be capable of operating at a frequency range up to 30 kHz. Furthermore, the STM must be capable of performing spectroscopy with the lowest detectable current, nominally around 1 pA.
f.	The STM and control electronics needs to have an offset compensation capability, which allows sub pA low current measurement. The residual offset current must be in the immediate range of 10 fA.

2.	Variable temperature specification
a.	The unit should be capable of operating in the temperature range of 25-1500K. Although not an immediate requirement of the initial procurement, the cooling and heating capability needs to be available as future options.  These options must be available at the time of purchase.
b.	Both the heating and cooling capability and hardware requirements should be limited to the sample plate itself.
c.	The sample must be the reference plane for any thermal expansion or contraction with respect to thermal drift compensation.
d.	Tip-surface distance during temperature changes needs to be maintained at nearly constant and in the sub-angstrom range.

3.	System specification
a.	The STM should be available as a bolt-on, self-contained, UHV compatible system.  The STM must be integral to a flange and removable independently.  The STM must reside in a UHV chamber which can then bolt on as a unit.  The UHV STM chamber and system as a whole must be capable of operation and routine performance in the UHV range of low 10-10 torr.  
b.	There must be well developed practical mechanisms for tip transferring and sample manipulation. This sample and tip manipulation must be routine and easy to perform with well tested and demonstrated techniques and mechanisms.  The necessary sample plates, tip holders, and manipulators must be available at the time of procurement and replacement or spare components must be readily available.
c.	The system needs to be equipped with a nano-positioning device that is operated by a Piezo motor. The device needs to be stable and repeatable for high precision positioning. The total range for the positioning device needs to be at least 1 cm in all three directions. The step size should be continuously adjustable from 40 nm to 500 nm.  This positioning system is the coarse positioning system and is separate from the high-resolution, sub-angstrom accurate positioning and imaging requirements from the atomic resolution imaging elements.
d.	The STM must be upgradeable in the future to full AFM operation with the required easy to manipulate tip holder and exchange mechanisms.  These components and upgradeability must be routinely available and available at the time of purchase.  There must be more than 20 operating STM/AFM systems in use which demonstrate the AFM capability.


4.	The system must come complete with full image analysis and hardware controller software.
a.	The system must have a standard full suite of image analysis and viewing software installed on a PC and delivered operational as part of the procurement. The computer should be a minimum 2 GHz processor speed with 40 GB hard drive minimum storage capability.
b.	The system must come with complete filtering and calibration software for image analysis and hardware control applications.
c.	The software must be upgradeable to allow AFM operation and also be capable of variable temperature drift control if that option is selected at any time in the future.
d.	The controller must use a minimum 16 bit D/A converter resolution and be capable of simultaneous two-channel 16 bit data acquisition.
e.	The controller and software must be capable of spectroscopy and nanolithography.  The nanolithography should be capable of operating in a simultaneous data analysis and image processing mode.

5.	Imaging and sample position monitoring.
a.	The system must come complete with a CCD imaging capability.  This should allow the tip position relative to the sample to be determined routinely and easily to allow precise intra-sample imaging.
b.	The imaging system must be complete with a light source, monitor and the ability to accurately monitor tip sample changes and approach as well as sample positioning.
c.	There must be more than 30 installed systems which have successfully demonstrated this imaging capability.  Details of users available on request.

6.	Availability and support requirement
a.	The manufacturer must have at least 100 units with the same specifications sold and installed in laboratory or industrial settings.  The manufacturer must provide an extensive list of more than 20 previous purchasers and users of this system on request.  
b.	The manufacturer must provide and demonstrate installed systems (more than 100 units) with the required atomic resolution on metal surfaces.  The STM must be routinely capable of atomically resolving Si reconstructed surfaces routinely.  The STM must be capable of imaging with atomic resolution on Au and Cu surfaces with 0.01 nm STM vertical resolution.

<DESC>This amendment to solicitation NRCS-18-KY-04, Closing Services for Natural Resources Conservation Service in Kentucky is to provide clarification and reference applicable clauses inadvertently omitted from the initial solicitation package.


PART I – THE SCHEDULE, SECTION B-SUPPLIES OR SERVICES

Pages 3-8 of this section are the bid schedules by which respondents to this solicitation will submit their offers for the services required in the performance work statement. 

Delivery orders or task orders will be issued by: Connie Mckinney, Contracting Officer; Linda Rhinehimer, Purchasing Agent; or Linda Fryman, Contracting Officer/Management Analyst.

Delivery orders or task orders will be issued by mail, facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods.

There is no guaranteed minimum number or maximum number of orders to be issued in the base period or any option period of this contract.


SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with Clause 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity (Oct 1995), the following applies:

This is an indefinite quantity contract for the supplies or services specified in the Bid Schedule and the Performance Work Statement for Closing Services (Appendix 4), and is effective for the base period from July 1, 2004 to September 30, 2004.

The Government anticipates the need for services beyond the base year and may extend the term of this contract in accordance with Clause 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.
(a)	The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days prior to the beginning of the extended term of the contract; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
(b)	If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
(c)	The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years. 

Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with Clause 52.216-18, Ordering (Oct 1995).  The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified.

Any services and/or supplies to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Bid Schedule.  Such orders may be issued in the base period of July 1 to September 30, 2004 or in any of the four option periods specified in the performance work statement.  The estimated inclusive time range is July 1, 2004 to September 30, 2008, if all option periods are exercised.  

All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.

If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered “issued” when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Bid Schedule.

Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations Clause or in the Bid Schedule, there is no limit on the numbers of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations. There is no guaranteed minimum number or maximum number of orders to be issued in the base period or any option period of this contract.

Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor’s and Government’s rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract’s effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after September 30, 2008.

In accordance with Clause 52.216-27, Single or Multiple Awards (Oct 1995), the Government may elect to award a single delivery order contract or task order contract or to award multiple delivery order contracts or task order contracts for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources under this solicitation.

In accordance with Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (July 1990), except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

In accordance with Clause 52.249-4, Termination for Convenience of the Government (Apr 1984), the Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government’s interest. The Contractor shall immediately stop all work under this contract and inform any subcontractors to cease work upon notification of termination. The Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed before the notice of termination. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. The Contractor will provide to the Government using standard accounting measures a clear and itemized list of all charges for which they request compensation. This paragraph does give the Government the right to audit the Contractor’s records. 

In accordance with Clause 52.249-8, Default (Apr 1984), the Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor or subcontractor, failure by the Contractor or subcontractors to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this contract, or fails to provide the Government with adequate assurance of future performance.  In the event of a termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. Should it be determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.
