<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established objectives to increase awareness of and promote healthy lifestyles as a means of preventing disease. To achieve this objective, the Offices of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs seeks to launch and evaluate a public health marketing campaign, to include a media campaign, to portray healthy lifestyles as normal, desirable, and achievable. Through this marketing effort, the DHHS's goal is to broaden the awareness of healthy lifestyles to the general public by launching a National Healthy Physical Health/Disease Prevention Awareness Campaign to increase subsequent occurrence of healthy lifestyles in adults. The Department of Interior's GovWorks Federal Acquisition Center, under authority of the Department's Franchise Fund and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award a Time and Materials type contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Negotiations will be undertaken with the Advertising Council, Inc., a not-for-profit nationally recognized and endorsed organization, based on their unique expertise, time-perfected techniques, and access to and support from major associations in the advertising and communications industry which allow the "Ad Council" to provide volunteer efforts and donated media time and space resulting in an excess of a 4000% return on the Government's investment. Other parties having an interest in this project may identify their qualifications and capabilities no later than 5 October 2002. Demonstrated qualifications and capabilities must illustrate proven experience with implementing and promoting a national public service advertising campaign, focusing on a target adult audience, and employing state-of-the-art communication techniques as well as a variety of communications channels and program strategies, including but not limited to print, radio, television public service announcements, media kits, and non-traditional marketing channels. Additional qualifications and capabilities should address community media outreach and public relations as they relate to public service advertising at this level and associated post-campaign monitoring and analysis, as well as access to and support from major advertising and communications industry associations. This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is there a solicitation associated with this announcement. However, any interest shown will be reviewed by the Government and used only for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interests of the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may provide qualifications and capabilities documentation to GovWorks, Attn: Jeanie Kampschroeder, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, Phone 703-787-1352 or Fax 703-787-1009.

<DESC>The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4 to Superior Technical Solutions (STS), Incorporated, a New Jersey-based small business, to provide support to the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) program at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center and FAA Headquarters.  This proposed contract is to provide programmatic consulting and training needs of the STARS Program Manager, Definition Supervisor, and Functional Experts for Requirements for Test to ensure requirements are met, understood, and documented.  A one-year performance period is anticipated, with an additional one (1) year option.   <P> It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the government to acquire these services from STS on a single source contract basis for the following reasons: <P> ·	The high level of experience specific to these tasks that STS personnel possess will make FAA extremely efficient in its work as opposed to other contractors who would need to come up to speed in some or all of the required tasks.  STS personnel have demonstrated that they can perform the diverse and unique requirements for developing and conducting STARS and other related training (e.g., OT&E Training, Leadership Training, and Test Conduct Training for AT and AF Field Personnel) quickly and on short notice.  Other contractors (e.g., Terminal ATB prime contractors) would take more time to develop course materials, be more expensive and would lack the understanding of the subject matter and target audiences.  STS personnel have a proven track record of exceptional quality and efficiency in prior tasks performed for the Terminal ATB and STARS (e.g., preparing responses to Congress and the IG).  STS personnel have contributed to significant savings in dealing with the STARS p! rime contractor (e.g., JumpSTARS development cost, and max configuration set-up).            ·	Although a few of the tasks outlined in this document and SOW could be performed by other contractors, no other source, other than STS personnel, can provide the combined knowledge, skill, and experience to perform all of the tasks given their complexity and demand for immediate turnaround.    ·	In addition to vast experience in all phases of the STARS project, STS personnel have the unique combination of training, consulting, project management, and systems engineering experience in Common Arts, En Route, Voice Switching, Oceanic, NASA, NATO, and DoD projects, etc., as well as STARS that are both within and external to the FAA.   ·	Due to the complexity and visibility of the STARS program at this time, no other vendor can match the skill, knowledge, and proven performance of the STS personnel, within the required critical timeframes to support the ATB mission.     <P> A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience in providing the above and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly.  All responses must be directed to Anne Marie Ternay, FAA Contracting Officer, by 11 a.m. on Monday, September 23, 2002, at the William J. Hughes Technical Center, Contracts Branch, ACX-51, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey 08405. <P>

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of optical interconnects between chips.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.

The technical objective of the Chip-to-Chip Optical Interconnects (C2OI) Program is to overcome the current chip-to-chip electrical interconnect bottleneck by developing and implementing innovative optical solutions.  The quantitative performance goal of this program for the chip-to-chip optical links is specified in terms of data rate (10 Gigabits per second or higher), channel density (16 channels/mm or higher), power dissipation (approximately 50 mW/channel), length (1 meter), signal integrity (bit error rate significantly below 10-12), and geometric form factor compatibility with existing systems (low net board profile, < 25 mm height).  It is envisioned that in the future, many applications will require 5-10 terabits of net data throughput out of a single Multi-Chip Module (MCM) on a board.  Therefore, it is essential that the optical solutions developed under this program are scalable in bandwidth and density beyond the numbers quoted above.  Qualitative features of the chip-to-chip optical interconnect technology include layout flexibility (which would require sharp bends in optical channels within and out of plane) and process compatibility with mainstream electronic manufacturing.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I.  Optical Transmitter Receiver Modules:  The theoretical advantages of optical interconnects can only be realized if the electrical-to-optical and optical-to-electrical transduction is performed in a space and energy efficient manner.  One of the principle areas of interest in this program corresponds to optical transmitter and receiver modules

II.  Optical Channels:  Chip-to-chip optical interconnects presuppose means for moving optical signals from the transmitting chip to the receiving chip over distances up to one meter.  The movement of optical signals, while static, should be free from any geometric constraints if the resulting system is to have the design and layout flexibility that current electric interconnects provide.  Coupling mechanisms for interfacing the optical channels to optical transmitters and receivers are essential for the program.  Passive optical coupling between optical channels on different boards and boards and backplanes is an area of research where significant innovation is needed to develop high performance, cost effective and manufacturable solutions.  

III.  Integrated Technology Demonstration:  The first two phases of this program are concentrated on technology development and laboratory system demonstration of chip-to-chip optical interconnects.  The third phase will lead to an integrated demonstration of the technologies developed in the first two phases that are optimized for specific applications.  The first part of the demonstration dealing with identification of insertion opportunities and quantification of system requirements will be performed in Phase II of the program.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 02-23 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The program will consist of three phases.  Phase I (18 months) is focused on constituent technology demonstrations.  The optical transmitter/receiver modules have an interim performance objective of minimum 4 channels with approximate data rate 10 Gbps and less than 100 mW/channel power consumption.  The second constituent technology to be developed in Phase I will be optical channels (minimum 4 channels) at a minimum of 8 channels/mm density and approximately 30 cm path length with demonstrated layout flexibility and low profile.  Coupling between the optical transmitter/receiver module and the optical channels is an essential milestone of Phase I.  Exploration of different strategies for achieving desired bit error rate and different levels of synchronicity would also be performed in Phase I.  The focus of Phase II (18 months) will be to explore different approaches of incorporating the optical transmitter/receiver modules with high speed, high-density electronic chips with significant system functionality (other than operations required by the optical link).  This work combined with the outcomes of the Phase I will result in a final laboratory demonstration of chip-to-chip optical interconnection with the performance specifications listed above.  Also performed in Phase II will be a study to identify most promising insertion opportunities and the preliminary design of a test bed for incorporating chip-to-chip optical interconnects.  Those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD will be selected for an optional Phase III (12 months) for conducting integrated technology demonstration.  Awards totaling $35 M for Phase I and II efforts and $10 M for Phase III are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2003.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase). Multiple awards are anticipated. Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged. The program will also support some very innovative individual investigator efforts. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Ravindra Athale, phone: (703) 696-2237, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: rathale@darpa.mil.

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 02-23, Chip-to-Chip Optical Interconnects (C2OI), Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on chip-to-chip optical interconnects, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original hard copy of the proposal abstract, 9 hard copies and an electronic copy of the proposal abstract (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-23) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Thursday, October 24, 2002.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original hard copy of the full proposal, 9 hard copies and an electronic copy of the proposal (PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable on a CD-ROM, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-23, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended).  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-23) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, December 16, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-23 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in chip-to-chip optical interconnects. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 02-23.  Proposals and proposal abstracts may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposal abstracts and full proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

Proposals must demonstrate that offerors are capable of implementing a strong social marketing communication methodology in their extension services to improve farmers' practices.  Furthermore, they are requested to demonstrate that they will be capable of developing a sustainable private sector, NGOs or university-based strong agricultural water-use efficiency extension with agricultural marketing/communication capabilities in up to three entities including Jordanian universities and/or Jordanian NGOs/cooperative and/or the private sector.  The Contractor will be responsible for managing the program and achieving a specific set of objectives.  The contractor will work with several local partners especially farmers association and cooperatives, the private sector, non-governmental organization, universities, community-based groups, research and extension systems and communication personnel.  The contractor will collaborate with other projects funded by different donors, working in the irrigated agriculture area.  The contractor will work with the private and public sectors to encourage farmers to increase their water use efficiency, switch to high value, less water intensive, crops as well as establish a viable agricultural extension system based on a social marketing, multi-dimensional communications model in the country.  This newly established extension service must have the capacity to plan and implement high quality research-based social marketing extension programs on a sustainable basis in the future.  USAID estimates that the contractor will need up to 60 months to fully carry out this effort.  However, the contract will be divided into a three-year base contract with two one-year options subject to extension of the Strategic Objective beyond the year of 2004.  The exercise of the option years are subject to demonstrated success during the base contract period based on an evaluation of the work implemented by the contractor.  USAID's estimate for the full 60 months is in the range of $5 million to $10 million. One contractor will be awarded the entire project.  It is anticipated the contract will be awarded by December 23.  USAID encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns and women-owned small business concerns in this activity as the prime contractor or as subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the FAR.  USAID reserves the right to cancel the project with written notice to the firms responding to this announcement.  To show an interest and request a copy of the Request for Proposals, which will be ready on or about August 28 for distribution, please send an e-mail request to Zabd-rabu@usaid.gov.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Chemical Immunology Section of the Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Pittsburgh, 3109 Cathedral of Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, services to test the in vivo efficacy of novel pyridinioalkanoyl thioester (PATE) compounds developed by the LCB using the non-human primate model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection established at the University of Pittsburgh.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Chemical Immunology Section of LCB has been involved in AIDS research for several years.  The Section synthesizes novel compounds targeted to retroviral nucleocapsid proteins and determines their suitability as drugs for treating infections with HIV-1 or other retroviruses.  The University of Pittsburgh Primate Facility for Infectious Disease Research will perform PATE compound efficacy studies using the SIV/cynomolgus monkey model.  The studies are pilot experiments and are designed to address whether administration of PATE compounds at two different doses for a short time period is effective at reducing viral load when compared to animals infected but not treated with drugs.  Virus loads will be determined using real-time RT-PCR by the Murphey-Corb Laboratory.  The University of Pittsburgh will provide preclinical in vivo evaluations which are essential to the further development of novel NCp7 inhibitors and advancement to clinical testing.  Contractor will provide a report to LCB with data on virus load in treated animals; and will measure drug toxicity.  The University of Pittsburgh Primate Facility for Infectious Disease Research is a state-of-the-art facility that has expertise in non-human primate models of HIV using the SIV model.  Dr. Barratt-Boyes is an expert in cellular vaccines for SIV and the study of dendritic cells, which are essential cells in the generation of antiviral immune responses. Dr. Murphey-Corb is the director of the facility with 20 years experience working in the SIV/rhesus macaque model, with interests in DNA vaccination for SIV.  Dr. Murphey-Corb's laboratory has developed a highly sensitive assay to reproducibly detect low levels of circulating virus by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  In the past twelve months, Dr. Murphey-Corb has developed the cynomolgus monkey as a valid non-human primate model for SIV infection.  This model provides an ideal experimental infection with which to test the efficacy of PATE compounds that is highly related to the natural HIV infection of humans.  Dr's. Barratt-Boyes and Murphey-Corb are uniquely qualified to provide the required services with their expertise in the SIV/non-human primate model.   Period of Performance: upon award of purchase order through 12 months.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) applies to this order.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 26, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The purpose of this initiative is to support the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in its mission to stimulate research towards discovery of improved therapies for tuberculosis, an important disease of global proportions and an infection associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), an increasing health risk to the world?s population.  The rising incidence of tuberculosis, particularly in conjunction with the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has contributed to a public health concern.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis has produced sizable medical challenges to the treatment and containment of infectious tuberculosis in the face of limited chemotherapeutic options.

In order to facilitate the development of improved drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis, and particularly multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, the NIAID requires the directed evaluation of selected novel synthetic and pure natural product compounds as potential tuberculosis antimicrobials.  It is envisioned that compounds will be submitted under confidentiality agreements by pharmaceutical houses or research institutions in exchange for microbiological information on the relative potency of compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  The goal of this effort will be to encourage the rapid and efficient exploration of new classes of compounds for development as potential anti-tuberculosis agents.

This contract will serve as the central facility for evaluation of novel compounds for physical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties.  Three other existing contracts will provide the laboratory facilities for acquisition, information management, microbiological tuberculosis screening and animal efficacy testing, respectively.  The successful contractor will be required to interact and share reagents with these laboratories.

Because of the critical public health need to rapidly identify and develop new candidate drugs to combat tuberculosis, the highly technical nature of the work required, and the numerous physiological and microbiological assays producing critical information, close coordination of the Contractor?s efforts by the Project Officer will be necessary.

This RFP solicits for an additional contractor to the current drug development program that provides assistance to the Government for the appropriate evaluation of lead compounds in animals. Cooperation and information exchange among all the contractors involved in the drug development program will be paramount to advancing new antimicrobials forward in the development process. 

It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately September 30, 2003.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-03-21 will be available electronically on or about September 30, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/cgi-shl/cmb/rfps.cfm. Please note that the RFP for this acquisition only includes the work statement, deliverable and reporting requirements, special requirements, the technical evaluation criteria, and the proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in the electronic RFP package. Following proposal submission and the initial review process, Offerors comprising the competitive range will be asked to provide additional documentation to the Contracting Officer. Responses to this RFP will be due approximately January 21, 2003.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The Region 4 Environmental Protection Agency will be issueing a sole source requirement to University of Georgia, Center for Applied Isotopes Studies for the following requirement.    The purpose of the proposed work is to systematically map the relative radio isotope composition of sediments at and near the Fort Pierce Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Sites (ODMDS) and the relative sediment density of the benthos.  Tracking of disposed dredged material at the ODMS has been coducted through areal mapping of sediment chemisty utilizing two systems developed by the  Center for Applied Isotope Studies: the Gamma Isotope Mapping System and the Continous Sediment Sampling System (CS3).  A pre-disposal survey was conducted in June 1994 as a baseline and a post-disposal survey was conducted in November 1996 and January 1997 following completion of the Fort Pierce  Harbor Expansion Project in September 1995.  A susequent post-disposal survey was conducted in February 1998. All surveys showed that the diposed dredged material persisted within the disposal site.  The 1998 survey showed that the areas beyond the locations of disposal had progressed toward  pre-disposal conditions, however, the disposal mound itself remained intact.  The proposed work will serve as a follow-up survey scheduled to be completed 7 to 8 years following disposal.  Data collected in this survey will be compared to the baseline and post-disposal survey data to identify  changes in sediment lithology in and immediately surrounding the Fort Pierce ODMDS to determine the long-term persistence of the dredge material.  This information will be used to assist in determining the extent and direction for long term migration of dreged material at the Fort Pierce ODMDS.   The required tasks are  1.  Gamma Spectroscopy, 2. Relative Sediment Density, 3. Box Core Samples for QA/QC, 4. Technical Report The period of performance  shall be for approximately 7-8 months after issuance of a purchase order.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation RFQ5-83070-904 for a dual vessel cryogen dewar for liquid helium, model number: NASA-HDL 12/10-SP3, with a warranty of 1 year. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the item from Infrared Laboratories, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  NASA/GSFC's X-Ray Branch requires a dewar of configuration identical to one already existing so that cold plates, shields, and experiment platforms can be interchangeable.=20 This leverages NASA's investment in the first unit, and reduces the additional cost of fully instrumenting the second unit. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 9, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A -- Technical Development of Loss-of-Coolant Frequency Distributions

<CONTACT>Stephen Pool, Senior Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 415-8168, Fax (301) 415-8157, Email smp2@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source contract entitled, Technical Development of Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) Frequency Distributions, with Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI) Columbus Operations to provide technical support to the NRC staff as they develop a regulatory guide on Leak-Before-Break (LBB) evaluation procedures. The proposed Regulatory Guide will be based on previous research, industry applications and prior rulemaking.  BMI will also provide technical support for risk-informing 10 CFR 50.46 and aid in the development of revised SBLOCA, MBLOCA and LBLOCA frequency estimates. The period of performance for this project is approximately 3 years. This proposed contract is a follow-on effort to contract NRC-04-98-039 entitled Technical Support for Regulatory Guide on LBB Evaluation Procedures. The NRC believes that BMI is the only known source capable of performing this effort in the required time frame. BMI has personnel with the unique experience and expertise necessary for developing physical models, realized through computer simulation, to provide the NRC with an analytical and predictive understanding of fracture mechanics and multiple degradation mechanisms for piping systems in commercial light-water reactor nuclear power plants.  Additionally, award to another firm would seriously affect the ability of the NRC to meet milestones in several critical research efforts.  SECY-02-0057 on risk-informing 10 CFR 50.46 requires that rulemaking related to LOCA-LOOP revision be finalized in the summer of 2003.  The LOCA redefinition effort will provide LOCA frequencies to support this effort.  The SECY paper also requires that the spectrum of break sizes be completed by June 2004.  Follow-on technical work to support potential rulemaking arising from the redefinition of pipe break sizes must be completed by June 2005.  BMI has been providing assistance to the NRC in this area since 1998. NRC believes this familiarity is critical in order to meet the milestone dates established by the Commission. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Tihomir Timotijevic, Director, Roads Directorate, Bul. Kralja Aleksandra 282, 11000 Belgrade, Republic of Serbia, Yugoslovia, ph: +381-11-30-40-701, 30-40-703, Fax: +381-11-30-40-614

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  EBRD Roads Technical Assistance Project in Serbia.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in examining investments in the road sector of Yugoslavia.
The international roads and railways passing down Serbia's river valleys make up the shortest link between Western and Central Europe, on the one side, and the Middle East, Asia and Africa, on the other. Hence, there is great geopolitical importance to its territory. These roads follow the course of the valley of the river Morava, splitting in two near the city of Nis. One track follows the valleys of the rivers Southern Morava and Vardar to Thessaloniki; the other, the river Nisava to Sofia and Istanbul.
Serbia covers 40,845  km, with 5,525 km of primary roads (380 km of motorways, 170 km of semimotorways, 4,975 km of arterial roads) and 11,540 of regional roads as well as 23,780 km of local roads.

Serbia has traditionally earned significant revenues from the transit of goods, while
countries to the east and south, such as Bulgaria; Romania and Macedonia, rely heavily on routes through Serbia to get their exports to west and central European markets. 

Much of the country's transport infrastructure is in very poor condition. Investment in maintenance and replacement has been minimal over the last 10 to 15 years, and there has been significant damage to road, river and rail routes.  Upgrading of roads is an urgent requirement for Yugoslavia and for the neighboring countries. Billions of dollars of investment for repair and modernization will be required for years to come for the country to become a regional transport hub.

The plan is not only to repair this damage by rehabilitating the roads, but also to build the capacity of the Serb authorities to manage their road infrastructure.  They will do this by establishing institutional tools and mechanisms that will encourage better planning, more transparent procurement and a gradual increase in the amount of road tolls, fees and taxes that are allocated to supporting the road system.
 
The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) grant provided to the Road Directorate of Serbia will produce a five-year road plan for national roads, based on up-to-date network information and on improved information management systems.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $500,000 grant to the Grantee from TDA.  The TDA Grant of U.S. $500,000 is correspondingly divided into U.S. 
$200,000 for Phase I and prospectively, U.S. $250,000 for Phase II and U.S. $50,000 for Phase III.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., October 25, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) provides supermarket style facilities and sells products to active duty military members and other authorized patrons worldwide.  DeCA requires work to be performed in support of developing a Derived Unique Key Per Transaction (DUKPT) key injection utility for the 5944 Magnetic Strip Reader (MSR) and for the loading of DUKPT encryption application onto Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) 5944/5945 MSR payment terminals in support of the Point of Sale-Technology Refresh (POS-TR) rollout. This utility encryption injection program is required to facilitate debit card processing.  DeCA has a Plastic Card Network (PCN) agreement between the Department of Treasury and Bank of America. Under this agreement, the Bank of America currently provides the Master Session Key encryption of DeCA's 5944/5945 MSR for the Point of Sales Modernization (POS-M) contract.  The requirement under the POS-TR contract is Derived Key Transaction (DUKPT), rather than Master Session, which also must interface to the commissary system.  This type of application must be compatible with the various financial networks throughout CONUS and OCONUS enabling the processing of various credit and debit card types. Award of an eighteen month base contract with 3 one year options is anticipated to be made on a sole source basis to the Bank of America. A Request for Proposal will not be available. Should any interested party feel they can offer the required support, notice via email must be provided to the Point of Contact by 5:00 PM CST on 01 Oct 02.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that 21st Contracting Squadron intends to award a follow-on delivery order against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) General Services Administration (GSA) to Lockheed Martin for Services in Support of Milstar Satellite Mission Control Segment (SMCS) AN/USQ-115.  The Satellite Mission Control Subsystem (SMCS) provides Milstar satellite commanding, telemetry processing, satellite anomaly resolution, cryptological key generation and dissemination, communication resource allocation, and time and frequency management.  The contractor shall provide software maintenance/ enhancements, technology transitional support, and related technical support for the SMCS. The Government is requesting sources to provide non-personal services to support the sustainment of Milstar Mission Control Segment (MCS) and Schriever AFB (4SOPS) direct mission support.  The contractor shall maintain Oracle and Ingress databases and produce releases for Satellite Mission Control Subsystem (SMCS), the Lockheed System Simulator (LSS) software component of the Milstar System Simulator (MSS), the Proficiency Trainer (PT), the Space Ground Link System (SGLS) component of Mission Support Element (MSE), and the G.E. Development Environment (GDE) software component of the Mission Development Element (MDE).  The tasks will include Centralized Integration Support Facility (CISF) software engineering, database sustainment, production of software and database releases, use of approved configuration management techniques, full participation in Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V), full participation in Certification Test and Evaluation (CT&E), full participation in management meetings and activities, abide by the regulations set forth on this document in the handling of Government furnished property and services, as well as the regulations to access Government property and facilities.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

A major Software Release is scheduled for late November 2002, plus a Milstar satellite launch is scheduled early calendar year 2003.  Lockheed Martin is the only firm with the expertise and knowledge to configure and optimize the software and databases for the MCS without delaying, jeopardizing and inducing great risk to this aggressive launch schedule.  Delays caused by a new contractor transitioning into full performance would impair the integrity of the launch schedule, jeopardize the safety and security of government property and could result in a launch delay and degradation of mission readiness.  

Concerns believing they having the ability to furnish the above services/supplies without impacting the launch schedule are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the acquiring office listed in this notice within 15 days from the date of this synopsis. This notification should clearly show their ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy and reliability of the requirement.  Must show ability to maintain Milstar system specific software to support the launch of Milstar Satellite Flight 6 in Jan 03 without degradation or risk of system operations. In addition, any interested offerors that believe they have the ability to provide the required service must currently hold a GSA FSS schedule 70 contract. This is not a formal solicitation. However, concerns that respond should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities and may request a copy of the solicitation when it becomes available. All information is to be furnished at no cost or obligation to the government. Along with the above requested product information, please include company name, mailing and e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519.  The Federal Stock Class (FSC) is R421.  Negotiation being conducted using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 ?Only One Responsible Source?? See Numbered Note 22.  Period of performance is 1 Dec 02 thru 30 Nov 03.  E-mail, fax or mail responses are acceptable.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals to develop and deliver a training course entitled ?Safety Conscious Planning.? It is a training program for about sixteen (16) hours of instruction over a two- (2) day period.  

The objective of this course is to integrate safety as a key planning factor and a performance measure in all transportation plans and programs. TEA-21 enacted in 1998, for the first time included safety as one of the seven planning factors to be considered in the transportation planning process. Until this legislation, federal laws have separately addressed transportation system safety and the required transportation planning processes. TEA-21 requires that ?each statewide and metropolitan planning process shall provide for consideration of projects and strategies that will increase the safety and security of the transportation system for motorized and non-motorized users.?  

Some Metropolitan Planning Organizations and other agencies address this requirement by developing a safety element in their long range plans, by including safety as a factor in developing the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) or by sponsoring a community-based safety education program.  However, many others do not address safety in any substantive way.  One reason is a lack of understanding of how to evaluate and identify safety problems and potential corrective engineering, educational and enforcement actions.  This program will train practitioners on how to routinely integrate safety as a key-planning factor. 

This training program is intended for transportation planning professionals with MPOs, state DOTs, FTA, FHWA, local planning organizations and transit agencies.  It also is intended for Motor Carrier Safety program managers, state police, police enforcement, State Highway Safety Specialists, representatives from Governors? Highway Safety, infrastructure safety programs, and Public Utility Commissions, and consultants.

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by Thursday, October 10, 2002.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned business.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

<DESC>This amendment of the combined synopsis/solicitation is intended to respond to questions from organizations that have expressed interest in supplying the required items.   This amendment also provides clarifications.  1)  The solicitation is intended to obtain the maximum number of computers within a limited budget.  Therefore, USAID is seeking basic computers that will serve the purposes of the schools in Uzbekistan.  High speed processors, CD-RW or DVD, large drives, additional memory, TFT-LCD screens will add costs but not necessarily add value.  Price is the most important evaluation factor.   2)  Offers may include extended warranties as an additional line item, but funds will likely not be available.  The basic warranty that is included in the price of the product and is applicable in Uzbekistan, not only to USAID, the purchaser, but to the schools where the computers will be installed, must be fully described.  3)  Many computers in the US are supplied with Windows XP or XP Pro already installed.  This preinstalled OS is generally the English language version, so a duplicate Russian language version would have to be purchased and installed, at additional cost.   If the Russian language version OS can be supplied in place of the US version, there should be a cost savings.   4)  This RFQ is part of the same program described in USAID RFP 122-02-006.  However, the requirements are separate and one need not have submitted an offer on RFP 122-02-006 to qualify for this RFQ.  Offerors or the contractor on RFP 122-02-006 are not disqualified for this RFQ.  5) The shipping terms are in the solicitation:  FOB American Embassy, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.  Delivery December 1, 2002.    Offerors whose shipments will originate in the US or Europe may also quote a price FOB an East or Gulf Coast US Despatch Agent or ELSO in Europe as an additional alternative.  A delivery date should be specified.  These prices should be clearly identified as such and distinct from the FOB Tashkent price. See FAR 52.212-4(i) regarding Payment.   6)  Adapters/converters to fit over/in US plugs/sockets are not acceptable.  7)  A local representative in Uzbekistan is not required in order to submit an offer.  8)  AIDAR 752.7009 is applicable to this contract.  9)  The minimum quantity is the quantity below which the unit price will be higher than the price quoted for 1000 units.  10)  Since quotes for single line items may be submitted, USAID may find it advantageous to order the software separately.  This would imply there was another offer of CPUs without a pre-loaded OS or priced such that separate purchase of the software was still advantageous.  11)  The response date and time is not changed.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition is soliciting sources for the preparation of biological research materials from relevant animal models of prion disease, and the provision of those materials to qualified researchers.  Of note, the main focus for this request is not for standardized reference reagents or proficiency panels (although those are not precluded) but rather for the collection of organs, tissues, cellular and body fluids, and pools of tissue specimens from infected and disease free contro l animals for rapid dissemination to the research community.   Applicants would be required to propose a plan for the collection, processing, and storage of specimens and arrange dissemination to qualified researchers.  The biological specimen repository would be made available to provide a variety of tissues from ani mal models of TSE to qualified researchers upon request.  Such materials should be from both pre-clinical and clinical stages of disease.   The program is interested in both rodent and large mammal models and cervid tissues, and recognizes the value of bot h individual samples and large tissue pools.  Applicants should be aware that the emphasis of any resulting contracts is for the rapid provision of experimental material to the research community. All interested sources should submit email information no later than October 4, 2002 to Pam Fisher at pam.fisher@amedd.army.mil and Pat Evans at pat.evans@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>The Precision Strike Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), intends to award a contract to modify the MK-84 General Purpose (GP) Bomb so that it will be more compliant with the Insensitive Munition (IM) requirements of MIL-STD-2105B.  This is a sources sought synopsis from interested industry sources. The Government intends to award one or more contracts for Concept Technology & Development (CTD) with options for System Development and Demonstration (SDD), Low-Rate Initial Production and One Year of Full Production.  The government believes that to achieve IM compliance with the MK-84, the contributions from both a less sensitive fill and bomb case design modifications must be considered.  The Air Force Research Laboratory is currently developing insensitive high explosive fills suitable for insertion into the modified MK-84 bomb case.  The contractor will be responsible for developing and delivering an improved MK-84 bomb case for testing.  The Key Performance Parameters of the MK-84 IM Technology Program follow: Threshold Requirements: 1. Equal or better operational performance (Pk) than the current GP bomb filled with the explosive Tritonal. 2. Equal or better IM response than the current GP bomb filled with the explosive PBXN-109, currently used by the US Navy (BLU-117). 3. The modified MK-84 bomb will be compatible with the USAF inventory of fuzes (and those currently under development) as well as PAVEWAY tail kits and guidance packages. 4. Preserve the current MK-84 bomb mass properties, thereby minimizing flight recertification.  Goals: 1. Fully meet IM requirements for the MK-84 bomb.  2. Reduce the current Hazard Classification from 1.1 to either 1.2.3 or 1.6.  THIS SS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION REQUESTED, TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government?s use of submitted information. The information provided as a result of this synopsis may be used by the Air Force in future acquisition strategy decisions and could be used in future RFP(s) which may be released to industry.  Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center?s Range Instrumentation System Program Office (RISPO), AAC/WMRR, is planning an Industry Day and One-on-Ones to discuss the upcoming acquisition for the Enhanced Range Application Program (EnRAP).  Potential offerors should monitor official Government Point of Entry (GPE) website (www.fedbizopps.gov) for all future EnRAP notifications and information.  The EnRAP acquisition will be based on a ?Best Value? procurement.  EnRAP will provide a significant improvement to Test and Evaluation (T&E) instrumentation capabilities desperately needed by Army, Navy, and Air Force test ranges to meet Department of Defense (DoD) responsibilities for comprehensive testing of emerging combat systems.  Development will be accomplished under the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), with production under the same contract funded by the individual Services.  EnRAP will provide a phased-in replacement for the Advanced Range Data System (ARDS) participant instrumentation packages and ground instrumentation currently in use on the T&E ranges.  EnRAP systems development will improve the T&E range technical performance for vehicle tracking and data transmission and significantly improve participant package flexibility, miniaturization, modularity, and standardization.  The participant package development will provide miniaturized modular instrumentation packages for internal mounting in high dynamic vehicles, instrumentation pods for external mounting on aircraft wing stations, and an EnRAP Aircraft Instrumentation Subsystem Internal (EAISI) package for the F-18 and AV-8B aircraft.  The participant package software and hardware can quickly and economically be reprogrammed, upgraded, and modified to meet continually evolving operational mission requirements.  EnRAP system improvements over the current ARDS capability will include (1) a significant enhancement of datalink capabilities in both throughput and flexibility, (2) a significant increase in the accuracy and data update rates for position, velocity, acceleration and attitude data, (3) a miniaturization of the participant packages, (4) the implementation of standardized interface protocols and an open architecture design, and (5) a replacement of the encryption subsystem with state-of-the-art encryption technology, all in accordance with (IAW) performance capabilities documented in the EnRAP System Requirements Document (SRD).  The most challenging datalink improvement will be to meet the requirement for increased EnRAP data throughput within the frequency bandwidths currently used by ARDS, and if possible to further reduce the bandwidth required for these additional data. Datalink parameters will be programmable and selectable for each mission and flexibility will be added within missions to make real-time changes.  Maximum flexibility will be built into the system to change the number of participants in the network automatically, customize message content, determine message length and format, vary the data collection/update rates, control uplink and downlink intervals, select radiated power to some degree (low and high power datalink version), allow for participant-to-participant communication and provide a message relay capability.  The datalink throughput baseline will support at a minimum 25 participants at 40 messages per second, using data messages that contain at least 1200 bits of usable information per message through one relay.  The system will support T&E range test operations with encrypted and unencrypted participants and variable data rates and will accommodate real-time changes to the number of participants in the network and changes to other system parameters.  Up to three relays (four hops) will be possible to extend range coverage.  It will be possible to concatenate available time slots to support transmission of messages longer than the standard 1200 information bits.  Two datalink transceiver versions will be delivered.  The basic high power datalink transceiver version will support air-to-ground communications to at least 130 nautical miles (nmi) (160 nmi objective) and an air-to-air communications to at least 100 nmi (120 nmi objective).  A low power transceiver version will support a 40 nmi air-to-air range and a 50 nmi air-to-ground range.  It is expected that the cost of  the low power datalink transceiver compared to a high power version will be significantly lower and will allow the range users the option to acquire higher quantities of the low power version to support tri-service testing needs for instrumenting a large number of  vehicles.  Message reliability will be 90 percent for participant-to-participant datalink transceiver transmissions and for communications with one ground station, and reliability will be 95 percent for communications with two ground stations in line-of-sight to the transceiver.  It will be possible to organize selected participant packages into at least four separate missions, with each using different security levels and different encryption keys.  The EnRAP datalink transceiver will operate in the 1350-1450 megahertz (MHz) band  using plug-and-play datalink modules.  An objective is for the datalink transceiver to be tunable to include the 1750-1850 MHz band if possible.  Capabilities in additional frequency bands will be demonstrated at a breadboard level (225-400 MHz, 1750-1850 MHz, and 2200-2500 MHz).  EnRAP will coexist with the Multi-Service Target Control system (MSTCS) datalink ground and airborne systems in the 1350-1450 MHz band without harmful or destructive interference.  An extended range control capability will be developed for EnRAP to make it possible for any T&E range to have complete control of all aspects of selected ground stations at another T&E range.  Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking accuracy will be improved by at least one order-of-magnitude (10 times) for position and several orders of magnitude for velocity, acceleration and attitude compared to ARDS.  To conserve cost, instrumentation with three levels of accuracy will be developed under EnRAP and made available for the range users.  The lowest-cost and lowest accuracy units will be used on low-dynamic participants (Level I).  The moderate-cost units will be used for high-dynamic testing that does not require extreme accuracy (Level II).  Level II instrumentation will be developed in both an internal mount configuration and a pod configuration.  The highly accurate, highest-cost units (Level III) will be used on high-dynamic participants when the highest level of accuracy is required and will be an internal mount configuration only.  Level III real time/post-mission position accuracy will be 0.3 meter/ 0.1 meter with real time/post mission velocity accuracies of  0.006 meters/second (m/s) and 0.002 m/s.  Level II and III participant instrumentation will have some resistance to performance degradation due to GPS jamming.  Interfaces will be standardized using commercial standards to the maximum extent possible.  Participant internal interfaces will include both RS 422 and a High Performance Serial Buss interface (example IEEE 1394).  Ground instrumentation will be interfaced using Ethernet.  Participant instrumentation will have the capability to interface to aircraft MIL-STD-1553 data buses.  The EnRAP ground system design will incorporate a Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA)-compliant interface to the existing host range infrastructure.  Participant instrumentation will include data recorders that have removable recording media with capacities of at least 10 gigabytes (GB) with an objective of 50 GB.  Participant instrumentation will be modular to allow easy reconfiguration to meet evolving T&E mission requirements and customer needs.  The datalink system uplink and downlink transmissions will be able to be encrypted with a Next Generation Encryption Device (NGED).  The data recorded in the participant can be unencrypted or encrypted using the NGED.  The NGED will be developed by the EnRAP contractor and the EnRAP participant and ground systems will be designed to meet National Security Agency (NSA) standards for red and black separation for data encryption up to TOP SECRET.  Participant packages will be designed to operate both with and without the NGED installed.  EnRAP participant packages and datalink ground station equipment will be designed such that they can be set to operate in an unencrypted mode while the NGED is installed.  A study effort will be conducted during the development phase of EnRAP (up until the critical design review) that will identify cost-effective approaches and opportunities for incorporating Combat Training System (CTS) capabilities into an interoperable EnRAP system architecture.  The EnRAP contractor will participate in the Next-Range Improvement (NexRI) Standards Development Consortium in support of the training study. Technical requirements stated in this announcement are subject to change.  Technical requirements will be defined in the EnRAP SRD which will take precedence over the requirements stated herein when it is released to industry.  It is the intent of the Government to establish a technical library on the ATIMS website (http://ATIMS.hill.af.mil).  ATIMS requires Internet Explorer or Netscape version 4.0 or higher.

<SUBJECT>36 -- 4WD Dynamometer Test Cell
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-4WD-Dyno
<RESPDATE>100102
<ARCHDATE>10162002
<CONTACT>SCOTT THARP, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone (513)487-2092, Fax (513)487-2107, Email THARP.SCOTT@EPA.GOV
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 10 procedures the EPA is seeking sources to provide information regarding 4WD Dynomometer Test Cells.  The Laboratory Operations Division at NVFEL is currently working on plans to potentially renovate the EPA old truck chassis cell (24ft. x 25ft. x 75ft.) to become a medium duty 4WD test cell that will also integrate many functions for Tier 2 testing of LDVs.  

In general EPA is trying to configure a room to position a vehicle in the middle of the air flow envelope and sampling systems.  In essence, EPA wants to move the rolls to the vehicle and have the other systems such as fans, exhaust flow measuring devices, and samplers move in a smaller area to minimize connector lengths.  EPA plans to replace or expand the subfloor pit to a size of approximately 55ft. x 16ft. x 8ft. deep.  EPA would like to have clear space in the pit to hang a subfloor, full flow, dilution transport piping system (8in. or 12in.) from the deck structure.  The deck frames and vehicle track area supports are made from 2in. thick by .25in. wall structural box beams in 8in., 6in., 4in. widths and solid 3in.x2in. and 2in.x2in. pieces.  These 29in. track logs cover a 25in. wide roll and wheel frame spacers are manually moved to accommodate any wheelbase.  This has proven adequate and is less complicated and more space effective than many rolling or sliding floor designs.  One scheme is to have both dynos (front and rear) move to facilitate the fixed vehicle location for all FWD, RWD, and 4WD vehicles.  The ability to move both dynos to within a 52in. center distance would also enable the possibility of testing a tandem axle.  This is a secondary feature, but one on which the EPA would like input as to the potential issues.
EPA also plans to include a mezzanine structure above the test area for supporting equipment and an xyz trolley(s) for the sampling systems or exhaust meters.  This structure could also support lights and ducts, and sprinkler systems to optimize the cell layout.

The specific questions below summarize some of the information the EPA seeks.  If these can be answered from a website, a product brochure, or a computer .pdf file, please send us a copy or reference.  If any digital pictures are available from existing test sites and systems, these would be very useful to illustrate the options.

1.	For a 48in. motor in the middle MDV dyno, what are the following values?  EPA has assumed an inertia capacity of 1000-14,000 lbs and 109in. width.
	a.  Rated Speed and Force
	b.  Base mechanical inertia
	c.  Maximum horsepower
	d.  Maximum force for 20 seconds
	e.  Amperage requirement at 480 3 phase
	f.  Size of power converter cabinets and isolation-transformers
	g.  Preferred location of power converter with respect to dyno (maximum distance?)
	h. Width and depth between the roll and motor and shaft for the deck frame structure.  Maximum vehicle axle weight that can cross the deck and rolls.
	i.  The weight of the machine and the recommended inertia block configuration
	j.  The locations of cooling fans and cooling airflow requirements
	k. The maximum amount of heat rejection expected in BTU/min
	l.  The locations and requirements for the electrical wires that need to move with the machine.

2.	What type of restraint system is recommended for MDV applications?  What types of facility pit preparations should be considered?  Can the dyno deck structure sit on a 12in. deep concrete ledge with a 4x4 angle iron cast perimeter?

3.	What technical approach is used for 4WD loading?  How does the system handle force response and roll synchronization at near zero speeds?  What is the transient force response and speed synchronization that can be obtained on each machine for an acceleration rate of 8 mph/sec?  How well does the 4WD simulation mode work for hybrid vehicles where one axle may be driving and the other axle may be driven?

4.	Does your company offer an integrated road speed modulated vehicle cooling fan?  If so, what are its specifications and sizes?

5.	What interfaces and data logging options are integrated with the system to get vehicle data into the dyno controller or to transfer test data out to other systems for post test analysis?  What protocols are utilized?

6.	Does your organization have any torque wheel data comparing track loading to that experienced on the rolls for 2WD or 4WD vehicles?

This information will help EPA prepare a better specification and assist in the design of the facility infrastructure.  Please provide as much information as possible regarding this inquiry.  Any other information not specifically requested here and you deem as necessary may be submitted also.  

Interested parties should submit all information to Scott Tharp at the above address by Fax (513) 487-2107 or by E-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Information should be submitted by close of business October 1, 2002.

<SUBJECT>B--Coyote Reservoir Re-operation Appraisal Study
<DESC>Desc.  Special Notice:  The Bureau of Reclamation, South Central California Area Office, intends to award Santa Clara Valley Water District, the water supplier to Santa Clara County, California, a contract to model and investigate in-district  reservoir re-operation scenarios.  The award will be made without competition (FAR  6.3) to take advantage of the in-house expertise and knowledge available through the District under the authority 6.302-1.  The study is to identify and evaluate a short-term interim "operational appraisal" of Anderson and Coyote Reservoirs that could address the San Luis Reservoir low point problem.  The low point problem limits the flexibility of State Water Projects (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) operations at San Luis Reservoir during most years.  The District is the most qualified to conduct the studies because as the operator of the reservoirs, District staff is already knowledgeable of the current operating criteria and limiting factors that may effect re-operation.  The NAICS Code is 541990. The solicitation number for this notice is 02SQ210059.  Refer technical questions regarding this project to Mr Kevin Moody at 559-487-5179.  Should there be insufficient response to this special notice an award will be made.

Statement of Work
For
Contamination Avoidance Detector Test Suite 
(CADTS)
Active Standoff Chamber
(ASC)


1.  SCOPE. This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the engineering design and containment demonstration of an Active Standoff Chamber (ASC) for the test and evaluation (T&E) of emerging chemical/biological (CB) DoD detection systems versus simulants and the calibration and validation of test equipment.    

1.1 Background. The CADTS Project was initiated to rectify the current broad-based, short-term deficiencies that exist for testing DoD detector systems.  Much of the current DoD CB instrumentation and facilities can test only point and passive standoff detection systems; future DoD detection systems will use active standoff technology and require a new suite of instrumentation. An active standoff facility is required for the evaluation of emerging CB Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) detection systems.    

1.2 Objectives.  The objective of this effort is to develop an engineering design with specifications and concept drawings plus a demonstration of the containment technology of an Active Standoff Chamber (ASC) that can generate and contain realistic CB simulant threats and challenge/evaluate active detector performance at standoff distances of 0.5 ? 5.0 km. All tests will be run under steady state (non-dynamic) threat cloud conditions. It is also desirable that the facility can be easily moved from one test site to another at the test range.  The ASC will also be used to calibrate and validate range test equipment such as the referee LIDAR systems.  The ACS will need to provide: 1) a means for transmission of the laser beam through opposite ends of the chamber with no optical disturbance to either the incident beam or scattered light (i.e., be ?invisible? to the LIDAR detector); 2) unobstructed view of the CB cloud within the chamber; 3) minimum back scatter and reflection from any instrument or chamber material; 4) the ability to disseminate simulants of chemical vapors/liquid aerosols/solid aerosols/particulates and biological liquid/solid aerosols; 5) a homogeneous cloud within the chamber for at least 15 minutes for the particle size distributions and concentrations listed in Table 1 (< 1% concentration change due to aerosol settling); 6) a 3 m diameter ?circular? or 3 m square optical aperture; 7) an optical working length of at least  30 m; 8) techniques and SOPs for the chamber and associated equipment to be readily and easily decontaminated; 9) means for preventing leakage/release of the CB simulant materials into the atmosphere; 10) capability to be easily moved to different locations at any one test range. The ASC must have instrumentation so cloud characterization can be monitored for a minimum of 15 minutes.  It is also desirable that the chamber has limited temperature-conditioning capability to allow for year-round operation in cold climates (no colder than 40 degrees F).

  	Table 1. Range of dissemination requirements

Threat	                  Threshold	       Objective
Vapor (mg/m3)	          0.1 - 100	       0.01 - 1000

Liquid  (micron)          10 ?500              1 ? 1000           
Aerosol (particles/liter) 1000 - 2000          10 ? 10,000  
     
Particulate (micron)      2 - 500              0.7 ? 1000
Aerosol (particles/liter) 500 ? 10,000	       10 ? 100,000

  
The engineering design study should address but not be limited to the following: Overall size and shape of chamber; construction materials; coating materials to minimize unwanted reflections yet provide for ease of decontamination; technology/methodology to achieve unobstructed end ?windows?; the number and location of access and instrumentation ports; methodology to achieve a homogeneous/stable cloud; threat cloud dissemination and recirculation systems; referee and monitoring systems; means for minimizing test cycle time; filtration system; sustainability issues including decontamination methodology and maintenance; test cycle control system; real-time data integration and processing. It is mandatory that the design study include experimental verification that the technology chosen for the end ?windows? satisfies all optical and leakage requirements. 

1.3 Assumptions.  The ASC will be initially based at Dugway Proving Ground, UT and will use CB simulants only. A separate control room will be used to operate the ASC systems.  The containment technique for the simulants needs to achieve the same levels that are acceptable (mandated) for ?live? agents (approximately 0.0001 milligram per cubic liter). Assume life span of this facility to be 10 years with an expected operational use of 1000 hours per year.


2.  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. The following documents are applicable to this SOW to the extent specified herein.

2.1 Other Government Documents. 

    Test Capability Requirements Document (TCRD) for the Contamination Avoidance Detector Test Suite (CADTS).

2.2 Availability of Other Government Documents.

The Call Center will direct callers to OPM employees and program offices, based on the type of information the callers are seeking.  The team is currently conducting market research to determine the appropriate staffing, services, hours, equipment and other elements appropriate to such a Call Center.  It recognizes the importance of industry involvement in such research and offers the following questions to interested parties to further the team's discussions: 1.  What services does your company provide?  2. What hours of service does your company provide? 3.  What equipment does your company provide your employees (e.g., phones, reference books, computerized index, etc.)?  4. What resources does your company devote to a given number of customers (for instance, one employee per hundred calls)?  5. What "best practices" does your company recommend?  6. Do your employees work in a central location or from their homes?  7. Do your employees provide any information other than that associated with your customers?  For instance, will your employees direct callers to another person or organization if the callers' questions do not apply to the agency or company for which they are working?  Please provide us with written responses that are detailed and specific.  We are also interested in knowing what is the capability of the small business community for performing work of this type. The North American Industry Classification System code for this project is 561421, and the definition of a small business is a firm that has had $6 million or less in average annual receipts over the company's prior three fiscal years.  All interested parties are encouraged to forward their responses to these questions via fax at 202-606-1508 or by e-mail to either Mr. Ronald Peacock at rapeacock@opm.gov or Mr. James S. Conners at jsconner@opm.gov by June 30, 2002.
