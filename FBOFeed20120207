However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

Background
The Department of Veterans Affairs in Erie, Pennsylvania has a requirement for the purchase of an automated cover slipping system with an automatic transfer station.  The successful offeror shall provide a coverslipper that is brand name or equal to the Fully Automated Glass Coverslipper Leica CV5030.  Currently, the cover slipping process is 100% manual and it consists of mounting glass cover slips onto individual pathology/cytology slides containing sections of tissue or cytopathology smears.  Preparation of pathology and cytology specimens for disease diagnoses is a six-step process and procurement of a walk-away, automated cover slipping system that is integrated with our current staining system will allow for a more streamlined process. 

The robotic cover slip will be integrated with the laboratory staining equipment to allow for automatic transfer between systems.  The cover slipper will place both mounting media and one glass cover slip on each individual stained slide.  

The Government intends to issue a purchase order for this equipment.

1.	The price of the system is to include shipping, installation, configuration, on-site training, and a 12- month standard factory warranty.
2.	The automated cover slipping system must be compatible for full integration with the Leica ST5010 Autostainer, creating an automated, walk-away workstation.

"	High-throughput cover slipping; at least 400 slides/hour
"	Can be used for different purposes at the same time (i.e. histology & cytology)
"	Fume extraction system with activated charcoal filter
"	Ability to use xylene-free mounting media
"	Accepts tissue sections and cytopathology smears
"	Provides wet cover slipping
"	Accommodates up to 24 x 60 mm cover slips
"	Ability to accommodate continuous feed of cover slips
"	Accepts commonly available brands of mounting media
"	Accepts different types of slide racks
"	Includes fume handling system
"	Programmable settings for optimization of cover slipping
"	Includes broken glass detector with automatic removal to ward off jamming
"	Integrated transfer station consolidates slide movement from stainer to cover slipper
"	Must integrate and be fully compatible with the Leica ST5010 Autostainer

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to establish one (1) Coordinating Center as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos study renewal.  The HCHS-SOL involves a clinical examination (Visit 2) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed in Junel 01, 2013 thru May 31, 2019; as well as continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort.  The Field Centers effort is expected to begin on June 01, 2013 and to end on May 31, 2019.  

The HCHS-SOL began in 2006 in four U.S. communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami, FL). Approximately 16,000 Hispanic/Latino men and women between 18 and 74 years of age were recruited between 2008 and 2011 across communities. A baseline examination (Visit 1) was performed during that period of time.  The objectives of the renewal of the HCHS-SOL program are to 1) further investigate the apparent paradox of high socioeconomic adversity, substantial cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD) risk factor burden, and low CVPD prevalence and mortality in Hispanics; 2) identify putative causes for diseases and conditions highly prevalent in Hispanics (e.g. diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), left ventricular hypertrophy, and gestational diabetes mellitus); 3) describe the  transformation of health-related risk and protective factors related to migration, acculturation, and length of time living in the U.S.; 4)  assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, cultural values, risk behaviors, and medical care access on health in Hispanics; and 5) investigate genetic effects, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions in relation to measured phenotypes in this uniquely admixed population. These objectives will be accomplished through annual follow-up and a second examination (Visit 2) of the existing cohort.

The HCHS-SOL Coordinating Center contractor shall be responsible for the tasks, including but not limited to the following:
1.  Demonstrated ability to lead, coordinate, and participate in all aspects of planning of Visit  2 components of HCHS-SOL;

2.  Establish and finalize subcontracts with an ECG Reading Center, Pulmonary Reading Center, Neurocognitive Reading Center and a Central Laboratory;

3.  Establish and finalize working agreements with the Echocardiography Reading Center associated with HCHS-SOL;

4.  Establish data entry systems to collect measures from the Visit 2 as specified in the protocol;

5.  Monitor recruitment of participants and completion of Visit 2 interviews and procedures;

6.  Provide central training and certifications of cohort follow-up interviewers, medical record 
acquisition staff, medical record abstractors and physician reviewers.

7.  Oversee the acquisition and reading of ECGs on all HCHS-SOL cohort participants; the Pulmonary Reading Center to oversee the training, acquisition, quality assurance, and quality control of the spirometry measurements; the Neurocognitive Reading Center to oversee  the acquisition and reading of neurocognitive tests performed by HCHS-SOL participants ages 45 years and older (approximately 3,000 per Field Center) that had these tests done at Visit 1; the Central Laboratory to oversee the training for the venipuncture, acquisition, process, aliquoting, and shipping of blood, serum, plasma and urine samples, and laboratory analyses.  

This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), although one (1) award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The RFP, NHLBI-HV-13-05, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offerors proposal will be available electronically on or about March 09, 2012 and may be access through the Internet at the following URL location:  http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#NHLBI-HV-13-05 and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the NHLBI posting section.  No paper copies will be available.  Proposals will be due on or about May 28, 2012.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement contract award with options will be made for a period of six years beginning on or about June 1, 2013.  Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.

The HCHS-SOL Field Center contractor shall be responsible for the tasks including but not limited to the following:

1.  Ensure that the protocol specifies comparability of repeat measures with those previously collected where trend analysis is planned.

2.  Collaborate with other Field Centers and the Coordinating Center in the development of an informed consent template with common language for all Field Centers.

3.  Recruit (call-back), obtain signed informed consent from and conduct the Visit 2 examination on all available cohort survivors.

4.  Provide for handling of collected blood and urine specimens including shipping to Central Laboratory and long-term storage and future measurements of additional biomarkers at the Central Laboratory.

5.  Provide participants with referrals for follow-up of medically relevant abnormal findings within a local network of health care providers or institutions to which participants can be referred if indicated.
6.  Contact all surviving HCHS-SOL cohort members annually and develop a local plan to maintain an annual cohort retention rate as high as possible but over 80% at a minimum.

7.  Design and execute a plan for mentorship of a minimum of 3-4 early career investigators (ECI). 

8.  Design and execute a plan to continue community relations to enhance communication of study progress and findings to study participants, their communities and the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population at large. 

9.  Use the system recommended or provided and maintained by the Coordinating Center for participant data entry and transfer from Field Centers to the Coordinating Center or Reading Centers.

10.  Provide a plan for transition of responsibilities, data and materials from the existing Coordinating Center to the new Offeror.

11.  Formulate hypotheses/research questions, and propose and write manuscripts to achieve the scientific goals of the study.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to establish an Echocardiography (ECHO) Reading Center as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study-Study of Latinos study renewal.  The HCHS-SOL involves a clinical examination (Visit 2) of the cohort that includes repeat and new measures to be performed in June 01, 2013 thru May 31, 2019; as well as continued follow-up contact and clinical events surveillance of the cohort through May 31, 2019.  The Echo Reading Centers effort is expected to begin on June 01, 2013 thru May 31, 2019.  
The HCHS-SOL began in 2006 in four U.S. communities (San Diego, CA; Chicago, IL; Bronx, NY; and Miami, FL). Approximately 16,000 Hispanic/Latino men and women between 18 and 74 years of age were recruited between 2008 and 2011 across communities. A baseline examination (Visit 1) was performed during that period of time.  The objectives of the renewal of the HCHS-SOL program are to 1) further investigate the apparent paradox of high socioeconomic adversity, substantial cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (CVPD) risk factor burden, and low CVPD prevalence and mortality in Hispanics; 2) identify putative causes for diseases and conditions highly prevalent in Hispanics (e.g. diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), left ventricular hypertrophy, and gestational diabetes mellitus); 3) describe the  transformation of health-related risk and protective factors related to migration, acculturation, and length of time living in the U.S.; 4)  assess the impact of socioeconomic factors, cultural values, risk behaviors, and medical care access on health in Hispanics; and 5) investigate genetic effects, gene-gene interactions, and gene-environment interactions in relation to measured phenotypes in this uniquely admixed population. These objectives will be accomplished through annual follow-up and a second examination (Visit 2) of the existing cohort. 

The HCHS-SOL Echo Reading Center contractor shall be responsible for tasks, including but not limited to the following:  
1.  Propose and determine structural and functional parameters for the echocardiography measurements for Visit 2; 

2.  Develop the Visit 2 protocol for performing the echocardiography examination; 

3.  Train and certify Field Centers echocardiography technicians, and train and certify echocardiography readers at the Echocardiography Reading Center;

4.  Perform readings and information abstractions of echocardiography measurements obtained during Visit 2;

5.  Track the receipt, reading and storage of the echocardiography images received from the Field Centers in an electronic database; at the end of the contract period plan for the long-term storage of the archived echocardiography images; and 

6.  Participate in the analysis and interpretation and publications of the echocardiography data, and 

7.  Based on the Visit 2 protocol, develop the criteria for urgent findings and alerts, and report them accordingly to the Field Centers and the Coordinating Center.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to modify an existing contract with Level 3 Communications, LLC, 1025 Eldorado Boulevard, Broomfiled, CO 80021, under the authority of FAR 6.302 for Internet Connectivity Services. NLM intends on extending the contract from 2/15/2012 - 4/14/2012. Vendors may identify in writing their interest and capability in response to this requirement or submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However all responses received no later than the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the world's largest biomedical library and the developer of electronic information services that deliver trillions of bytes of data to millions of users every day. Scientists, health professionals, and the public in the US and around the globe search the Library's online information resources more than one billion times each year. Large data sets are also frequently exchanged among NLM and its research partners domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) of the National Library of Medicine provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences in support of the research and management programs offered through the NLM.</p>
<p>OCCS develops, operates, and maintains the backbone computer network and facilities, and supports, guides, and assists other NLM components in local area networking. The Division provides professional programming services and computational and data processing facilities to meet NLM program needs; operates and maintains the NLM Network Operations and Computing Facility; designs and develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses and seminars, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS helps to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available throughout all of the organizations comprising NLM. The Division also serves as a technological resource for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs. The Division promotes the application of High Performance Computing and Communication to biomedical problems, including image processing and information security.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide high speed Internet connectivity to the National Library of Medicine's network which is located in Bethesda, Maryland. This will provide commodity Internet access to the public as well as the research and medical communities around the world. This connectivity needs to be provided via a Global Tier 1 Internet Service Provider (ISP). It must also include protected circuit connections from the ISP Point of Presence (POP) to NLM. These connections cannot be provided by the current ISPs that are presently being used by the Center for Information Technology (CIT) within the National Institutes of Health Network (NIHNET), since NLM uses the CIT/NIH internet connections as a backup. This connectivity must initially provide 2 Gbps bandwidth. The provider must have the capability to upgrade the connections up to 10 Gbps bandwidth.</p>
<p>Order HHSN276200700077P with Level 3 is scheduled to end 2/15/2012. In August 2012 the services were re-competed and an award was made to Global Crossing with contract HHSN276201100015C. Because of delays in the transition NLM intends on extending the order from 2/15/2012 - 4/14/2012.</p>
<p>The extension will give Global Crossing, the new NLM-Internet contract holder, additional time to install a new communications circuit for the upgrade of Internet services from a 2 Gigabit bandwidth to a 10 Gigabit circuit. Global Crossing has been delayed in installing the new circuit because of various reasons including: permit delays due to road construction in the area, delays in working with NIH networking groups to plan and coordinate cable installation on the NIH campus, and a Global Crossing corporate ownership change.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is March 12, 2012 at 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about April 2, 2012. Offers should be submitted via e-mail to Nancy.Deberry@uscg.mil. Facsimile Offers are acceptable and may be forwarded via fax number to (252) 335-6790.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (V18 NCO), in support of the VA Southwest Health Care Network (VISN 18.) intends to negotiate a Sole Source Procurement for Oncotype DX Testing Services with Genomic Health Inc., 301 Penobscot Dr. Redwood City, CA 94063-4700.  This procurement is being accomplished in accordance with FAR Part 6.302- 1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

The Oncotype DX assay may be used in newly diagnosed ER+, N- breast cancer patients to predict risk of recurrence.  The assay can also be used to identify patients who may be successfully treated with tamoxifen and may not require adjuvant chemotherapy.  Tamoxifen-treated patients with an excellent estimated prognosis may be spared adjuvant chemotherapy.  The Oncotype DX assay is designed to support individualized treatment planning.  The assay provides a quantitative assessment of the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit and distant recurrence, which may increase confidence that the treatment plan is tailored to the individual patient.  Oncotype DX assigns a Recurrence Score from 0 to 100 based on the gene expression profile.  Higher scores predict a great risk of recurrence and a greater likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy.  Lower scores are associated with low risk and minimal chemotherapy benefit.  Approximately one third of women with node negative and ER and/or PR positive tumors have been reassigned to a lower risk category and have been spared the expense and adverse effects of chemotherapy.

The applicable NAICS for this requirement is 621511and size standard is $13.5 Million. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete the proposed procurement is based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will NOT be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements by February 14, 2012.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer (9-90C) via email at Lillian.Provencio @va.gov or ATTN: L. Danielle Provencio, V18 NCO, 3601 S. 6th Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85723.  If no responses are received, the V18 NCO will proceed with the sole source procurement to Genomic Health Inc., 301 Penobscot Dr. Redwood City, CA 94063-4700.

This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of MILSTAR Base Band Processor (BBP) Cables production. This is a market survey. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.

Prototypes completed under this former effort failed to pass shielding effectiveness and maximum clamping voltage as defined in the cable and connector specification drawings. The government will provide the test procedures, plans and reports produced under this previous effort and a prototype of each cable to the successful bidder. The government will consider offers that propose to analyze the designs, prototypes, and test data, and modify the designs, if required, to meet the specifications referenced above. The required prototype production, testing, and data deliverables will be contingent upon the solution the contractor proposes.</p>
<p>This contract is to analyze, define, develop, and produce Base Band Processor (BBP) Cables spares to support MILSTAR sustainment in accordance with the performance requirements defined in specification drawings.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS:<br />To be considered as a potential manufacturer/supplier source for this requirement, a Contractor will be required to submit technical data, in response to a solicitation, verifying their capabilities to perform engineering root cause analysis, and produce/supply this item. The Contractor will be required to verify to the Government that the developed items are able to comply with all of the specifications.</p>
<p>4.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE:<br />Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.

<p>4.1 Briefly describe the company, products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information deemed relevant.</p>
<p>4.2 Please describe any projects the company has been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.</p>

All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>Retroactive Processing and Payment Validation
<p><br />Introduction</p>
<p>This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide: support the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with program integrity efforts by completing the retroactive payment adjustments, reconciling the final payment for non-renewal contracts, receiving and processing monthly attestations and performing monthly analyses of any discrepancies submitted by Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs), Cost Plans, Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans (MA-PDs), Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Plans, and Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) and reporting on these activities. The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH. This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal, or other solicitation, and in no way obligates CMS to award a contract.</p>
<p>Interested contractors must submit a capability statement to demonstrate their ability to establish and maintain data security systems, in accordance with OMB Circular A-130 Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, "Security of Federal Automated Information Systems", which are necessary for maintaining the strict confidentiality requirements of all CMS data obtained from CMS files, as well as data collected under any potential contract. These confidentiality requirements shall also include all requirements for successfully safeguarding any and all data that could identify individual Medicare beneficiaries. <br /><br />Background</p>
<p>Medicare managed care programs operate under Section 1876, Section 1833, and Sections 1851 through 1859 with the Prescription Drug Program operating under Section 1860D of the Social Security Act. These statutory provisions authorize CMS to make payments to eligible managed care organizations on both a cost and a risk basis. Currently, there are over 25 million Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in 850 organizations that are paid over 12.5 billion dollars on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Cost-based organizations are paid based upon an annual budget submission by the contracting organization. Risk-based payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) and some demonstration projects consist of a monthly capitation payment based upon a variety of factors that may include demographic characteristics of each Medicare enrollee. Demographic characteristics include age, sex, and county of residence, Medicaid status, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) status, and hospice election. Information regarding the demographic characteristics of each beneficiary comes from several sources, including Medicare beneficiaries, CMS databases, Social Security Administration (SSA) data, and contracting managed care organizations.<br /><br />Monthly capitation payments are calculated differently for cost versus risk-based organizations. However, all requests for enrollment are received from the MAOs and submitted to the CMS Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug System (MARx). The CMS Medicare Beneficiary Database (MBD) record is checked for Medicare entitlement, and the individual's residence and health status information (demographics) is collected from the source databases. This information, along with the type of managed care organization, determines the capitation amount the MAO shall be paid for the beneficiary for that month. There are several special factors which impact the individual beneficiary payment, and therefore, the aggregate payment to the organization. Those special factors include Medicaid status, Low Income Subsidy (LIS) and ESRD status among others. In some instances (e.g., ESRD status), the payment level is significantly impacted.</p>
<p>The Part C &amp; D regulations require that managed care and prescription drug organizations provide CMS with a certification of all data that affects the calculation of CMS' payments to the organizations. Pursuant to that authority, CMS has a requirement that managed care organizations and Part D Sponsors submit monthly statements certifying the accuracy of the enrollment data submitted to CMS for use in the calculation of payments. To make this statement, MAOs shall certify the accuracy of not only their data, but also the data provided by CMS. This requirement, by nature, has led to increased scrutiny by MAOs of CMS' payment systems and reluctance to attest to the accuracy of data that is not controlled by the organization, but rather is provided to CMS by other State and Federal agencies according to widely varying schedules. Because the certification is required monthly, MAOs anticipate all adjustments, with the exception of ESRD, brought to CMS' attention shall be corrected in the next month's report. While CMS is requiring MAOs to dedicate resources to meeting the certification requirement, it shall also be prepared to address more timely the adjustments brought to its attention.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of MMA in 2003, timely processing and accuracy of MAO and PDP enrollments (PBP Changes) and disenrollments are having a greater affect on the accuracy of CMS payments. An MAO's failure to process their enrollment requests timely affect the primary capitated payment, risk status and the accuracy of the pharmacy submitted Prescription Drug Events.</p>
<p>In order to respond to this notice, contractors must be able to indicate experience and/or the ability to provide all of the numbered points below. Give enough detail so your response clearly indicates that you can provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Ability in conducting pre-payment review and adjustments to beneficiary enrollment information.</p>
<p>2. Ability in producing multiple data files from large scale data collection efforts efficiently using file specification provided by CMS.</p>
<p>3. Ability to perform the data collection and data production using the most cost-efficient methods available and to meet deadlines for both data collection and producing multiple data files on a timely basis.</p>
<p>4. Ability in making reconsideration determinations with Medicare Advantage Organizations that are appealing decisions regarding payment discrepancies.</p>
<p>5. Capability to maintain strict data confidentiality standards including all requirements for use of, access to, and storage of CMS data files and fulfilling all HIPAA regulations.</p>
<p>Information Request</p>
<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to Jimmie Curtis(jimmiecurtis1@cms.hhs.gov).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATIONFOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<br />The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.<br />The White River National Forest in Glenwood Springs, Colorado anticipates soliciting for and awarding a project for Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Inspections at Green Mountain Reservoir on the Dillon District of the White River National Forest. The Contractor shall provide all plant, supervision, management, quality control, labor, tools, equipment, appliances, and materials and perform all work necessary to implement ANS inspections. Contractor will operate as an Authorized Location and follow all regulatory requirements as specified in the State of Colorado ANS Regulations, agents will conduct inspections and (when necessary) decontaminations on all motorized and/or trailered watercraft prior to entering and again while exiting Green Mountain Reservoir. The State of Colorado Aquatic Nuisance Species Act (SB08226) was passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Ritter in May 2008. According to this State Law, any vehicles found to be contaminated with ANS will be decontaminated by following the Colorado State protocols before being allowed to enter Green Mountain Reservoir. As detailed in the DNR ANS Watercraft Inspection Handbook (February 22, 2009), agents will follow all State procedures and use State forms for watercraft inspections and decontamination. The contractor will provide a daily diary that includes the number of vehicles inspected, time of day of each inspection, and the results of each inspection with their monthly invoice to the Forest Service Contracting Officer. The contractor will follow all State laws pertaining to ANS inspections and decontaminations, which may include submission of inspection results to the State. Authorized agents will collect, document, and report any suspected ANS found on watercraft and submit samples weekly to the DOW Aquatic Animal Health Lab according to procedures outlined on page 4 of the decontamination form. Known ANS detected shall be collected, documented, and reported and submitted immediately. Email ReportANS@state.co.us prior to sending in samples.
<p>All personnel employed under any resultant contract shall be trained and Stage II certified in accordance with Section 802 of the State of Colorado Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Regulations.</p>
<p>Colorado Parks and Wildlife personnel will conduct quality assurance checks at watercraft inspection and decontamination locations to verify proper procedures are being utilized. If the Divisions' personnel observe failures to use proper watercraft inspection and decontamination procedures, then either a written warning notice will be issued or they may decertify an authorized agent, a location, or a Level II trainer until they have attended and passed the appropriate training again. Should this action result in closure of Heeney Marina launch facility, pecuniary remuneration may be due the marina operator.</p>

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source bridge contract to Stinger GhaffarianTechnologies, Inc. (SGT), pursuant to 10 U.S.C  2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source,in support of Goddard Space Flight Centers (GSFC) Applied Engineering and TechnicalDirectorate (AETD).  This procurement will provide a bridge contract, for a period not toexceed 24-months, comprised of a base period of 12 months and two 6-month option periods,to allow sufficient time to finalize planning and procurement activities associated withthe Mechanical And Related Systems (MARS) and the Instrument Systems and TechnologyEngineering Services (ISTES) procurements.This bridge contract will be structured as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The bridge contract will allowfor new work until the MARS and ISTES competitive follow-on contracts are in place. Thebridge contract is necessary in order to ensure program continuity and critical missionsupport and to avoid significant technical impacts to the AETD and supportingdirectorates.  The current Contractor is required to provide on/off-site multidisciplinary engineeringservices supporting all aspects of mission and instrument development and implementationas required by the AETD.  An interruption and restart of those tasks, with a newcontractor for a limited time until the MARS and ISTES contracts are awarded, wouldgreatly jeopardize the success of critical and highly visible Agency programs.	TheGovernment does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.SGT, Inc., as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience, and expertiseto provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support.  Due to the time andsubstantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor,SGT, Inc. is considered the only contractor that can meet GSFCs needs.  Interestedorganizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort inwriting, via email, to the identified point of contact not later than 5:00 PM EST onFebruary 22, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  A determination bythe Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".Any referenced notes may be viewed a tthe following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD). The CNST NanoFab is a state-of-the-art nanofabrication laboratory, and the XRD will be used to characterize samples ranging from a few mm in size to 6" round wafers. The vast majority of the samples will consist of multi-layer thin films requiring the measurement of the following properties: phase identification, grain size, interfacial layers, atomic concentration, thickness, density, roughness, and stress. Wafer mapping will be required. Other samples will contain nanoparticles or nanopores and the XRD will measure nanoparticle size, distribution and shape.
<p>The XRD shall also be capable of analyzing single crystal samples and powders. The instrument shall be equipped with the hardware and software necessary to utilize a variety of techniques: glancing angle diffraction, X-ray reflectometry, in-plane diffraction, rocking curves, pole figures, reciprocal space maps and small angle X-ray scattering. All slits shall be adjustable, motorized and computer-controlled, with no manual re-alignment needed when switching any optical element. The system will be sited in a multi-user facility where ease of use, intuitive software, fast and easy conversion from one technique/configuration to another, and ruggedness are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for an XRD that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>X-Ray Source</p>
<p>NIST will consider the following sources with, typically, copper K&alpha; (K-alpha) radiation:<br />&bull; Standard sealed tube (2-3 kW)<br />&bull; Rotating anode (6-9 kW)</p>
<p>Goniometer</p>
<p>A five-axis theta-theta vertical goniometer is preferred in order for the sample to be nearly horizontal at all times.</p>
<p>Sample stages</p>
<p>The sample stages must provide for XYZ movement of the sample (minimum XY -50 to +50 mm) and tilts required for in-plane measurements.</p>
<p>High temperature stage</p>
<p>Room to 1100&deg;C with vacuum, air and inert gas capabilities</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS</p>
<p>The Ceramics Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing two silver nanoparticle reference material, of 10 nm diameter and 75 nm diameter. This reference material must be aligned with international demands and expectations for quality of reference materials for silver nanoparticle standards, such as the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) testing programme's Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN). Producing high quality silver nanoparticles suitable for reference materials is a challenging task. The company must be able to provide a product that meets the following technical specifications.</p>
<p>Product Specifications:<br />&bull; Products must be manufactured by a U.S. vendor that has routinely demonstrated manufacturing silver nanoparticles that meet or exceed requirements for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN) common test materials for silver nanoparticles.<br />&bull; Product #1, Nominal 10 nm diameter, Product #2, Nominal 75 nm diameter, diameter measurements based primarily on silver core diameter by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Particles should be spherical in shape.<br />&bull; 6 L of 10 nm, 6 L of 75 nm, at 1.0 mg / mL (within +/- 10%) total silver content; minimum of 6.00 g silver in total per diameter, 12.00 g silver total order.<br />&bull; The mean TEM diameter of the silver core of the "10nm" particles must fall within the range of 8.0 nm to 12.0 nm, and the mean TEM diameter of the silver core of the "75nm" particles must fall within the range of 70.0 nm to 80.0 nm.<br />&bull; Have a C.V. less than +/- 20% for 10nm, and +/- 20% for 75nm (where C.V. is defined as one standard deviation of the mean of all NPs sized by TEM divided by the mean size), based on N&gt;1000 for entire batch, or N&gt;200 per smaller batch.<br />&bull; Product should have a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capping agent. <br />&bull; Excess synthesis reagents should be removed (for example, reducing agents, unreduced metal salts, intermediate capping agents), such that the purity of the product meets or exceeds OECD common test material purities. <br />&bull; An additional PVP content of 4 wt% should be added to the suspension. PVP should be of an approximately 10 kDa molecular mass (MW). <br />&bull; Particle cores must contain all silver. If seed-mediated methods are to be used, only silver seeds may be used; no gold, other metal, polymer, or any other material may be used as seeds.<br />&bull; Precursor material selection and process engineering should provide endotoxin levels in the final product to be less than 2.5 endotoxin units (EU)/mL.<br />&bull; Provide "testing aliquots" from (each) batch, containing no less than 20 mL, shipped overnight to NIST for testing and verification that using NIST's equipment aliquots can be freeze-dried into a powder, then resuspended by adding 5 mL of deionized water and waiting 1 hour, and recover all material into a monodisperse suspension as originally provided as measured by reproducing the absorbance spectrum (UV-vis), dynamic light scattering (DLS) intensity-based size distribution, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). If signs of agglomeration are present, the formulation request may be subtly modified at this point before shipping (such as adding additional PVP).<br />&bull; The materials should be able to kept in the dark and refrigerated whenever stored. The materials may be exposed to normal laboratory light during normal production, processing, and handling.<br />&bull; Quality assurance on each product should be performed and provided, including:<br />o TEM diameters, following NIST - Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL) protocol number PCC-7, and performing TEM measurements within 24 hours of particle deposition onto substrates. (http://ncl.cancer.gov/working_assay-cascade.asp) No less than 1,000 nanoparticles should be sized, with number-based size distribution histograms provided in addition to no less than 10 representative TEM images of the nanoparticles used for sizing analysis.<br />o DLS Z-average size and intensity-based size distribution, following NIST-NCL protocol PCC-1.<br />o Total silver content measurement by chemical analysis, for example by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).<br />o Endotoxin test results, following appropriate NIST-NCL protocols. Additionally, data provided should include calibration curves with several concentrations of endotoxin positive controls only, silver nanoparticle solutions only, and several concentrations of endotoxin positive controls added to silver nanoparticle solutions; this will assure there is no false-positive or false-negative results due to the nanoparticles potential interference in the assay.<br />o Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy absorbance spectra.<br />o All quality assurance methods and materials should be provided with the data.<br />&bull; Packaging &amp; Shipping:<br />o The materials should be packaged in sterile containers and sealed.<br />o All materials must be able to arrive "fresh." Specifically, all the materials for a given product must arrive at NIST no later than three weeks from the commencement of the first reduction of silver atoms in the first batch ("start" of synthesis). "Testing aliquots" should be sent by overnight delivery to NIST no later than 8 calendar days after the start of synthesis (received by NIST no later than 9 calendar days after the start of synthesis), in order for NIST to verify acceptable freeze-drying performance. <br />o Shipment should include proof temperatures did not exceed 45 &#7506;C, or drop below 2 &#7506;C.</p>
<p><br />Companies should include in their response their plans for achieving each of the following specifications. Please include the company's size classification in any response to this notice. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort.</p>
<p>All documents must be sent to Micole Cheatham, contract specialist, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. Email address: micole.cheatham@nist.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Market Survey - Request for Information - IT Services for DoD Purchase Card Data Mining and Risk Analysis
<SOLNBR>HQ0102-12-0001
<RESPDATE>112811
<CONTACT>Chris Webster, POC, Email chris.webster@dla.mil
<DESC>This is a Market Survey for Information Technology, I.T. professional services.
<p>In 2007, the Department of Defense (DoD) Purchase Card Program Management Office (PCPMO) procured a Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM/RA) capability to:<br />&bull; Identify and report fraudulent and abusive spending and theft and misuse of government property associated with its purchase/payment cards; and<br />&bull; Report on the overall health of DoD Purchase Card programs at various levels in the<br />reporting hierarchy, based on compliance with purchase card internal controls as a component of the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS)</p>
<p>This Market Survey represents a restructuring of the acquisition strategy for the Data Mining-Risk Assessment (DM-RA) portion of the PCOLS Program.</p>
<p>Acquisition Objective: The Purchase card On-Line System (PCOLS) has several components. This Market Survey is related to the integration of the Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM &amp; RA) applications associated with the PCOLS application suite. The Government is seeking information on how an interested contractor would perform as the System Integrator for the DoD Purchase Card Program Management Office to perform tasks associated maintaining and sustaining the Data Mining and Risk Management functions of PCOLS while bringing together the component subsystems of the Purchase card Program into a whole and helping ensure that those subsystems function seamlessly. Such a firm would act as the Purchase Card Program Management Office's primary crossing point to PCOLS vendors, ensuring that business requirements are appropriately interpreted and integrated into the functional and technical architecture. This includes project management, scheduling, requirements gathering, software development, testing, and change control processes in coordination with the Program Management Offices.</p>
<p>Business Objective(s): The over-arching business objective is the adaptation of new technology which can be effectively and affordably deployed in PCOLS quickly. The functional business objective is to Mine Data from Purchase Card transactions via the deployment of a data-screening tool that uses a combination of discreet DoD-tailored business rules to detect card misuse, and a "neural learning" capability that enables the identification of transactions at the most risk of being fraudulent or abusive. The transactions mined will be screened, scored, and when appropriate, referred-to card mangers for review, and archived. In addition, the system is to "learn" from past transactions to build a knowledge base that improves scoring accuracy over time. This fully scalable risk assessment application will be equal or equivalent-to the current COTs sub-system (FICO's Falcon&reg; Fraud Manager<sup>TM</sup>). On a monthly basis, it provides a report card, based on transaction through-put from numerous financial institutions, which identifies and stratifies at-risk transactions, based-on the internal business rules established to ensure robust internal control of card use. This objective also includes the delivery of configurable web-delivered reporting within the confines of DoD Information Assurance regulations, including CAC-enabled single-sign-on for users.</p>
<p>Systems Description: PCOLS includes the DMDC Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA) which is used by multiple DoD information systems, Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA). EMMA is an application for the verification and provisioning of credit card officials and their supervisors. AIM is a workflow application for the approval, issuance and maintenance of the purchase card and provides the capabilities to the DM application to screen each purchase card transaction. DM and RA are a combined third party service. The DM algorithms uses DoD specific risk indicators coupled with account profiles, purchase patterns and purchase card transactions with the greatest potential for fraud, waste and abuse in regards to the laws, regulations and policies governing the DoD Purchase Card Program. The RA application provides Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs), Agency/Organizational Program Coordinators (A/OPCs) and the Program Development Implementation (PDI) office with system generated transactions that have been identified at various levels of risk for action and response in the RA application.</p>
<p>System Architecture: Closely associated with DM&amp;RA is a sub-system developed by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) which uses existing DoD personnel data in an integrated workflow to authorize Purchase Cardholder accounts and to process the results of the data mining output. DMDC maintains the historical files on purchase card transactions for the PMO. The selected contractor will be required to work closely with DMDC to ensure well-coordinated integration of these sub-systems.</p>
<p>PCOLS Transaction Profile: In FY 2010 DoD issued over 40,000 cards, at any time having approximately 105,783 cards and 48,800 managing accounts and processed 8,884,734 purchase card transactions through the PCOLS application valued at $7,772,622,463.</p>
<p>Vendor Qualifications: The contractor will be responsible to possess the necessary facilities, qualified personnel, supplies and equipment necessary to operate, update and maintain the Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA) applications. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The Government anticipates full and open competition procedures for a single award of a Firmed Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), for a base award and three option periods.</p>
<p>Interested companies should submit a white paper that includes a brief description to include the following information: <br />1. Potential Technical Solution(s)<br />2. Capabilities to include: a. Information on the System Integrator; b. Information on the type of Data Mining Engine; c. Information on the Risk Assessment application and the success of the application; d. Any additional information to assist with evaluating the type of technology used for performance.<br />3. Summary Personnel Qualifications <br />4. Past experience in Data Mining and Purchase Card Operations<br />5. Past U.S. Government Contract experience. <br />6. Facility security clearance level. <br />7. Technology NAICS Codes in which the offeror normally conducts business. <br />8. Is the offeror small or large business.</p>
<p>Note: Clearly mark any information that is proprietary. More information about PCOLS may be located at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/pcols.html.</p>
<p>This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Any information that the responder considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned, including any proprietary information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. <br />Please submit your responses to: Mr. C. W. Webster, e-mail: chris.webster@dla.mil by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, 30 November 2011. <br />The Government will only accept written questions, via email, until 4:00 p.m. (EST) on Monday, 28 November 2011.</p>

The Marine Corps would like to see industry focus on affordability by designing/proposing solutions that will reduce the operational and support costs over the life cycle and consider such things as commonality, modularity of proposed solutions and interoperability among Systems of Systems.
  These solutions should take into consideration emerging technologies and provide for growth over the next 15 years. Additionally, the Marine Corps is interested in hearing from industry strategies they would use to lower their procurement costs for their proposed solutions.

As announced in the January 7th 2011 Special Notice to industry, the Marine Corps is planning both interim and long term strategies for its amphibious capability. This includes potential upgrades to the AAV program. This is a follow-up Request for Information (RFI) that expands upon the RFI as originally posted on 18 August 2010 via a Sources Sought Synopsis related to the Marine Corps AAVS.  There currently is no Request for Proposal (RFP) under development, and no RFP is available.
  

Marine Corps Systems Command continues to seek information from potential responsible sources capable of performing AAVS sustainment and survivability upgrades in support of the AAVS fleet, as this requirement remains unchanged. In addition to the AAVS sustainment and survivability upgrades, the Marine Corps is now exploring the possibility of further enhancements to a portion of the AAVS fleet.  

The purpose of this expanded RFI is to conduct market research / market survey that will identify potential sources, capabilities, and interest in the program, and assist in developing an acquisition strategy to meet Government requirements. The scope of work that is the focus of this expanded RFI now includes enhancements to the Command, Control and Communications (C3), lethality systems, propulsion system, litter mounting-medical evacuation, habitability, and water mobility.
  Market research for both requirements is being conducted concurrently. 

Program Background:  The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) Model 7A1 (AAV7A1) Family of Vehicles (FOV) serves as the Marine Corps' primary amphibious lift and armored personnel carrier.  It consists of three variants - a personnel carrier (AAVP7A1), a command and control variant (AAVC7A1), and a recovery variant (AAVR7A1) - that were originally developed in the 1960s and began fielding in 1972.  All three variants are fully tracked, armored platforms capable of conducting amphibious landings in accordance with Joint Doctrine for Amphibious Operations JP 3-02.  The AAV7A1 FOV is currently the primary means of delivering the initial infantry of the surface assault element for forcible entry operations during amphibious operations.
  There are currently 930 AAVP7A1s, 76 AAVC7A1s, and 51 AAVR7A1s, for a total of 1,057 vehicles.  The overall objectives of the Sustainment and Survivability Upgrade are to maintain the operational effectiveness of the AAV7A1 FOV fleet until replaced. Request industry provide solutions that can support fielding beginning in 2017. This expanded RFI addresses the additional enhancements being considered for a portion of the AAVS fleet detailed below, and are in bold print to emphasize the area of interest that is now expanded. 

 Potential Scope of Work may include the following:

The Marine Corps has a potential requirement for a contractor to provide AAVS Sustainment and Survivability Upgrade for the AAV7A1 FOV, and additional future enhancements as described below.
  The Contractor would be responsible for providing AAVS sustainment and upgrade solutions under the management of the Program Manager, Assault Amphibious Vehicle Systems (PM AAVS) at the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, Virginia, and various other locations as necessary. Other locations may include CONUS or OCONUS, and at the contractors own facilities. Information under numbers 1 through 6, and 7(a) through (d) were part of the original RFI. Items 7 (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) are added under this revision, and are the subject of the expanded RFI.  
.  
 
The contractor would be tasked with potentially providing some or all of the following services/supplies:
1.	Program Management Support:  Includes participation in Government directed development of price and availability of upgrade components;  internal project management and associated accounting using the Earned Value Management System, scheduling, document preparation and on-site representation at Government or contractor facilities, as directed.
 
2.	Technical Support:  To include participation and subject matter assistance in Government led design/production engineering, engineering analyses, quality management, configuration management, value engineering, reliability and maintainability, systems safety, system integration, and test and evaluation.  
3.	Field Service Support:  To include Government led sustainment, maintenance and modification of the master configuration vehicles provided as Government Furnished Equipment and on-site technical representation as directed by the Government. 
4.	Acquisition Logistics: To include all disciplines required to assist the Government with comprehensive logistics assessments for systems/subsystems/components, inclusive of supportability goals, cost/performance trades, and life-cycle cost.
  
5.	Concept Exploration:  To include Government led prototyping, development, production of components, subsystems and assemblies for the AAV7A1 FOV.
6.	Implementation of Engineering Change Proposals: Based upon Government directed concept exploration, or other Government direction, provide for the development, production, procurement, kitting, fielding, and implementation of engineering change proposals to the AAV7A1 FOV. 
7.	Options:  As an option to this effort, the Government may task the contractor to assist in the conduct of research, development, and acquisition of survivability enhancements to all or a portion of the AAVS fleet.  Examples of potential enhancements include: 
a. External Fuel Tank:  To remove the internal fuel tank and relocate externally to limit the likelihood of loss of life and catastrophic vehicle damage due to penetration and resulting fires caused by overmatching threats and munitions, and to meet the range requirements of 300 miles as per the Required Operational Capability (ROC) for the AAV7A1 FOV (ROC No.
 MOB 1.13B).

b. Underbelly/ Sponson Armor Kit (with mounting provisions and storage): To provide protection to the crew and occupants against Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and conventional (anti-personnel and anti-tank mine) underbelly and roadside attacks.  

c. Spall liner:  To mitigate the behind armor affect caused by the penetration from munitions and to increase crew survivability.  

d. Blast Attenuating Seats: To mitigate shock transmitted through the vehicle to the occupants from an underbelly attack. 

The Following items have been added to the RFI:

e. Lethality:  Lethality enhancements to be applied to a portion of the AAVP7A1 fleet.  Options being considered include but are not limited to replacement of the current Up-Gunned Weapons Station with a 30mm Remote Weapons Station.

f.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice that seeks information from potential interested sources for a pending Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case. There currently is no Request For Proposal (RFP) under development, and no RFP is available. 


Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking information from potential responsible sources for an anticipated partnership with Marine Corps Logistics Command (MARCORLOGCOM) to perform modifications on the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) hull. This effort is part of the AAV Reliability, Availability and Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (RAM/RS) Program. Modification of the AAV hull will allow for the installation of a modified suspension system and new engine to the vehicle.


The general requirements include hull modification of AAV7A1 Family Of Vehicles (FOV).
  The potential requirement currently consists of the Foreign  Government purchasing 26 AAV7A1 (22 AAV P7A1, 2 AAV R7A1 and 2 AAV C7A1) Hulls from the U.S. Government and an additional  26  AAVS Hulls (22 AAVP7A1, 2 AAVR7A1 and 2 AAVC7A1) currently belonging to the Foreign Government will be shipped to MARCORLOGCOM and upgraded. These vehicles will be upgraded to the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (RAM/RS) configuration. The contractor will be required to provide the necessary modifications to the AAV hull that will allow for the installation of a modified suspension system and a new engine to the vehicle.  This may include, but is not limited to, welding and machining of stripped ballistic aluminum alloy hulls.
 Offerors shall have the capability to lift and maneuver an AAV hull, with approximate dimensions of 130 inches width, 130 inches height, 321 inches length, and 30,000 pounds weight. There is the potential for the contractor to actually procure and possibly install upgrade components or kits containing the upgrade components. At this time, the acquisition strategy includes MARCORLOGCOM as the responsible party for the rebuild of 52 AAV7A1 vehicles; however, MARCORLOGCOM does not have the facilities to perform the required changes to the AAV hull modifications. The AAV7A1 will be disassembled at MARCORLOGCOM facilities and the hulls will be provided to the contractor for modification in accordance with the Government provided technical data.
  It is anticipated that this will be a Government-Contactor workshare agreement, and any contract awarded will necessitate a teaming agreement/arrangement between the contactor and MARCORLOGCOM to accomplish the requirement. Interested sources shall possess all the capabilities necessary to perform this effort as the Government does not intend to provide the necessary facilities, equipment or tooling to any contractor for performance of the hull modifications.


Parties interested in providing information in response to this RFI are invited to provide the following information to assist the Government in this market survey: 
  

-Introductory Statement (not more than 5 pages) that includes at least the following: Organizational Name, Address, Point of Contact information, DUNS and CAGE Code, Business size and type (i.e., large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, minority owned, etc.)


-Statement of capabilities addressing the Governments potential requirement, including organizational structure, and production/engineering facility capabilities, and procuring/kitting of material.
   


-Information on previous/current experience and projects that may be comparable, similar to, or closely approximated with the scope of work, including any experience teaming with a Government entity on a project. 


-Any other information that the respondent may determine to be of value to the Government in evaluating the current market and industrial bases capabilities in supporting the potential requirement. 


Responses shall be limited to a total of not more than 30 pages that are not larger than 8.5 x 11 for each sheet and the font size should be no less than 12 pt and povided on CD  in CD format, but must be readable in at least Microsoft Office 2003 and/or Adobe Reader Professional 8.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Paulson Manufacturing Corporation<br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br> <br>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <br><br>The Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate is in need of two highly complex molds that will be utilized to prototype a ballistic mandible for the Integrated Head, Neck, and Face Collaborative Science and Technology program (IHNF CSTP). <br><br>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <br><br>Paulson Manufacturing Corporation prototyped the Phase II mandibles using surrogate materials for the IHNF CSTP. Paulson has developed complex mold fabrication techniques and are intimately familiar with the mandible, program and the requirements. The lead time for the molds is 14-16 weeks. The Phase III effort kicked off 1 February 2012 and end 31 July 2012. That would leave a new contractor 10-12 weeks to deal with getting up to speed, understanding the prototyping process for the mandibles to include the plastic and ballistic material which has a process all of its own, and managing any processing issues. Paulson is capable of producing both the ballistic inserts and the injection molded shells.<br><br>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br><br>Paulson Manufacturing Corporation is currently prototyping a ballistic mandible for another program at NSRDEC, using NSRDEC's ballistic material specifications. From this partnership with NSRDEC, Paulson would be using the two molds for prototyping mandibles for the IHNF CSTP using the same technologies / processing parameters. This has cut down the development time for creating a ballistic mandible for the IHNF CSTP and which will result in a cost benefit savings to the government.<br><br>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   <br><br>The prototype mandibles fabricated for NSRDEC have performed well in ballistic and bump testing, validating the ballistic recipe to be used to fabricate the IHNF CSTP's mandible.<br><br>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <br><br>Continue the relationships with industry partners.<br><br>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: sean.g.auld@us.army.mil no later than 7:00 a.m. on February 13, 2011.<br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground<br>CCAP-SCN, Natick Contracting Division <br>US Army Soldier Systems Center <br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact: <br><br>Sean Auld, Contract Specialist<br>Sean.G.Auld@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a modification action for the extension of contract period from 12 February 2012 to 10 August 2012 of the York International Corporate Contract SPM760-02-D-9710. This project was initiated to afford additional coverage while DLA works on the successor project. The contract is a long-term type currently in its 10th and final year. York International is the only approved source and all NIINs are available through the primary point of contact, Dena Vernon at dena.vernon@dla.mil. Items will be procured on an "ALL or NONE" basis per NSN. All responsible sources may submit and offer/quote which shall be considered. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess the complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1). York International (CAGE 66935) is the sole approved source. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors described in the solicitation. All terms and conditions as indicated in the contract remain for the previously specified extension period/ NIINs to be covered under this project include:</p>

POC IS MSG SANDRA BERNARD.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  

Evaluation of offers:  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price, technical capability, and past performance.
 Technical capability in combination with past performance is approximately equal to price.

Past Performance:  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.
 The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.
  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

Government intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price contract to winning offer under SAP FAR 12.6.  If price cannot be guaranteed for second and succeeding option years, contract may be awarded as FP-PPR under FAR 16.205 Fixed-price contracts with prospective price redetermination.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated contract award date is on or before March 5, 2012.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations; these factors are listed in their relative order of importance: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. <br /><br />Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements regarding meeting space, food and beverage, audiovisual equipment and technical support, lodging, and secured storage. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet ADA requirements for accessibility , as amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to meeting space, lodging, and parking. Quotations should reflect the quality of customer services provided , the layout design and quality of the facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space, amenities such as free wi-fi in the conference space, and upkeep of the facilities. (b) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the following U.S. Postal Code areas (see attachment for a complete list of area zip codes), with adequate low cost or free on-site parking for participants and presenters. (c) Availability of Dates- Base Year 2012. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (d) Availability of Dates- Option Year 1, 2013. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date.</p>
<p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide references for a minimum of three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc). In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates. Evaluation of Options: Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br><br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br><br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>Additional contract requirements: If the item(s) required in the contract resulting from <br />this solicitation are customarily warranted in the trade by a standard commercial <br />warranty, such warranty shall be incorporated into this contract and thereby provided to <br />the Government at no additional cost. Any standard commercial warranty provided shall <br />be identical to the standard commercial warranty normally offered by the Contractor to <br />the Contractor's most favored customer. Offerors are requested to state the terms and <br />conditions of their standard commercial warranty or to attach a copy of the warranty <br />terms with their proposal. <br /><br />QUOTES ARE DUE BY THURSDAY, 09 FEBRUARY 2012, 12:00 NOON EST.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 14 August 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>AFNWC/PKO<br />2000 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bldg. 20604<br />Kirtland AFB, NM 87117</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The AFNWC/PKOD will be soliciting a Competitive 8(a) Set-Aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 377 MSG/CE mission at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. Competition will be restricted to companies within the State of New Mexico. Contractors shall have a bona fide place of business in the State of New Mexico. A determination/approval of a bona fide place of business must be acquired through the Small Business Administration. Current A&amp;E contractors on contract at Kirtland AFB are not permitted to participate. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Maintenance Contract. Individual Task Order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task Order limits will be $2,000 to $3,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $64M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at Kirtland AFB, NM. Offers are solicited only from business concerns current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)<br />Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to 8(a) small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet the requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project consists of a facility expansion, LRPD Advanced HPM Research Facility Expansion (Project # MHMV 110112). The seed project magnitude is between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Kirtland AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors:</p>
<p>1) Mission Capability<br />2) Past Performance<br />3) Price/Cost</p>
<p>Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used:</p>
<p>a) Organizational Structure and Staffing <br />b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project<br />c) Change and Cost Control Management<br />d) Quality Control Program</p>
<p>The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors will be afforded primary emphasis in the evaluation, are considered equal in importance, and, when combined, are significantly more important than the Price/Cost factor. Price/Cost, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness. The sub-factors within each factor are considered equal in importance.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive a basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 Task Order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 15 Feb 2012 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened. For those Contractors who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be</strong></span> traveling with someone who already has base access, please get the information requested in the Pre-Proposal Conference Announcement Packet (Guest Name, Drivers License #, State of Issue, and Date of Birth) to Samuel McDuffey, <a href="mailto:Samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil">samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2011</strong></span>.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to publish questions and answers for this solicitiaton. This amendment is simultaneously posted at: http://www.bia.gov/WhoWeAre/AS-IA/OCFO/Acquisitions/CurrentHQ/index.htm
Q.1.  Why was the prior solicitation (A12PS00134) supplanted by the referenced RFQ?
			A.1. The government chose to redefine its requirement.
Q.2.  Why is the duration of training at each site decreased from 3 days ("Day 01: Travel to tribal site; Day 02: On-site final coordination and logistical set-up with the tribe at the tribal locations; Day 03: Conduct a one-day, 8-9 hour training session. Day agenda must be submitted to IEED prior to training; Day 04: Travel return) to 1 day
			A.2 The government's requirement is for one day of training. As long as the one day training complies with the SOW, the government is not concerned with how the contractor schedules the task.
Q.3.   Under Personal Qualifications (unnumbered page 4), the RFQ states that the "minimum qualifications for personnel are: A. Trainer(s) must possess a jurist doctorate degree from an accredited university." Does this requirement preclude the Quoter from utilizing staff other than a Trainer in the preparation of training materials, travel planning, and other support services?
A.3 No.
Q.4.  Under "Price Factor" "Contract Line Item Deliverables" (unnumbered page 6), the RFQ states that, "other direct costs-Travel? NTE $9000." Later in the RFQ, under "Deliverables? Training Materials: (unnumbered pages 9- 10)" the RFQ states: "develop a binder of approved training materials to accommodate 140 attendees over 7 sessions on or before the date of each session." Similarly, Under "Other Direct Costs and Travel," (unnumbered pages 31-32)  "1) Other Direct Costs -- Other Direct Costs (ODC's) are items which are allowable and allocable direct costs to the purchase order for which BIA may reimburse the contractor. Such items shall be charged in accordance with the contractor's established and accepted accounting practices except as stated below. The COR may provide approval for materials and supplies up to $0.00 (for a single item or related group of items). For costs beyond $0.00, the BIA Contracting Officer's approval is required. For ODCs requiring the Contracting Officer's approval, contractor shall submit ODC requests via one e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, and CORs as applicable. This consent is only indicated to be a determination of technical reasonableness and is not a pre-determination as to the allowability of these costs. Equipment is considered to be "facilities" for the purpose of part 45 of the Federal acquisition regulation and, with certain exceptions, may not be reimbursed as a direct charge to the contract."How does the government wish the contractor to bill for the 140 binders containing the training materials to be developed?     A.4 Training materials are a direct cost of this purchase order and are included in Contract Line Item 0001. The fixed price line item should cover the quoted price of the contractor. The contractor is not authorized materials as an other direct cost. 
Q.5.  Under "INDIAN PREFERENCE-DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR (APR 1984)" (unnumbered page 28), the contractor is required to comply with this clause. Is this solicitation (A12PS00455) a "Buy Indian" procurement? If not, why not?
   A.5 It is an incorrect interpretation to assume the clause provides the quoter any preference in evaluation of quotes at the time of award. This clause starts after any purchase order is  awarded and is part of post award contract administration.      Amendment 0001 to this solicitation states: "The purpose of this amendment is to restrict the requirement to       Indian firms as defined under the Buy Indian Act in 25 USC 47.
Q.6.       The RFQ states that the training session shall be "one day" long.  Does this mean a full 8 hour training day including the session, breaks and lunch?  Please clarify if there is a minimum amount of actual instruction time not including any breaks.   Are the beginning and ending times for the training day specified? [NOTE:  If the day is a total of 8-9 hours instruction, it will have an impact on how the curriculum is written to maximize the amount of information delivered and retained in such a short period of time.  Since this is a complex area, the long, continuous training in a single day may be too long for participants.]
A.6 The time allocation reflects the government's view on the level of detail needed in the training. A normal training day (8-9 hrs.) is anticipated with a one hour lunch break and two 15 minute breaks during the day.
 Q.7.       The former RFP [sic] stated that the trainer was required to consult and meet with the tribal representatives the day before the start of training.  Does this RFQ have the same requirement for the trainer to meet with the tribal reps before the training, either in-person or via telephone.  If not, is the trainer allowed to meet with the tribal reps and is there any time that may be allocated to do so?
 		A.7 The requirement is for training for one day. Should an award be made, the successful contractor may contact the tribal members however all such activities shall go through the contracting officer's representative and no parties are authorized to change the terms and conditions of any purchase order which may be awarded. 
Q.8.       Our firm has developed federal charters for Tribal clients as work/tasks assigned pursuant to general legal services contracts.  Our firm did not have a contract with the DOI to develop the charters on behalf of the Tribes.  The contracts between the firm and its tribal clients were not specific to federal charter development, but general legal services that included charter development and some of the representation is still on-going.  Further, the firm's negotiated rates with its clients is proprietary information and attorney-client privileged information between the firm and its Tribal clients.  Thus, what information would suffice to respond to questions in the solicitation on contracts from the DOI to develop federal charters and for direct representation of our tribal clients?
		A.8 The government is unclear what the question is asking. However the government is not able to provide guidance on what constitutes sufficiency of the contents in the quote.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation section 3.104 identifies the particulars of Procurement Integrity, which DOI BIA rigorously adheres to.

Please note that this telecom is optional and not mandatory for potential offerors.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Central Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with a size standard of $18.5 million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
() The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAVAIR Lakehurst's USMC Expeditionary Airfield Sustainment Lighting Program (SLP) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) seeking integrated solutions to supply materials, tools and equipment for the management and operation of US Marine Corps expeditionary airfields located throughout world in current and future Areas Of Responsibility (AOR)'s. This initiative will also support Contingency Operations, Training, Exercises, and Humanitarian Relief efforts in the US and throughout the AOR's. The objective for this initiative is supporting the customer by ensuring reduced cycle times, achieving the best pricing available utilizing commercial business practices, and structuring processes to ensure maximum oversight, reducing administrative burden and increasing customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INITIATIVE OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Sustainment Lighting Program is one of the four systems of USMC Expeditionary Airfields supporting the forward deployed Marine. The Government is requesting input from industry, to determine the potential for a Long Term Contract in support of the Marine Corps expeditionary airfield operations, specifically the SLP.</p>
<p>Projected Scope of Work:</p>
<p>&bull; Supply Chain Management &rarr; Develop and maintain an active and continually evolving state of the art supplier base</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Distribution and Warehousing &rarr; Utilize transportation infrastructure to support geographic locations throughout the world to support EAF Marines</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Quality Control &rarr; insure all products tendered meet the appropriate recognized national and industry standards regarding inspection, testing, grading, marking and general quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Customer Direct Support &rarr; Ensure all products delivered to ordering activities comply with the description of products requested by the customer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Data Management &rarr; Utilize a management System that is compatible with industry and government systems</p>
<p><br />Item Selection &rarr; Any item required by the ordering activity to support construction and routine maintenance of EAF Airfields. In general, the scope includes Sustainment Lighting for EAF Airfields materials and other supplies, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#61607; Electrical products (generators, wire, connectors, sockets, outlets, lights, etc.)</p>
<p>&#61607; Tools of various kinds</p>
<p>&#61607; Communication devices (such as walkie-talkies, two-way radios, etc. used by the maintenance personnel).</p>
<p>&#61607; Contractors should be able to supply the entire product types listed above, as well as various other immediate need maintenance and repair items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Non-routine Type Items &rarr; Items that might not routinely be used in the operations arena, but for reasons within the discretion of the ordering activity, the ordering activity has determined to use such supplies to meet its requirements. Example: temporary storage containers required to support construction of airfields, training or exercises. The intended purpose for their use will place such containers within the scope of this initiative.</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>This is a Market Survey for Information Technology, I.T. professional services.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Department of Defense (DoD) Purchase Card Program Management Office (PCPMO) procured a Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM/RA) capability to:<br />&bull; Identify and report fraudulent and abusive spending and theft and misuse of government property associated with its purchase/payment cards; and<br />&bull; Report on the overall health of DoD Purchase Card programs at various levels in the reporting hierarchy, based on compliance with purchase card internal controls as a component of the Purchase Card On-Line System (PCOLS)<br />This Market Survey represents a restructuring of the acquisition strategy for the Data Mining-Risk Assessment (DM-RA) portion of the PCOLS Program. There are two over-arching goals:</p>
<p>1) System integration as a program management function that achieves efficiency and intelligent use of existing data and data streams.</p>
<p>2) Use of the latest and most effective technology to mine purchase card data and create dynamic analysis of that data through business intelligence.</p>
<p>Acquisition Objective: The Purchase card On-Line System (PCOLS) has several components. This Market Survey is related to the integration of the Data Mining and Risk Assessment (DM &amp; RA) applications associated with the PCOLS application suite. The Government is seeking information on how an interested contractor would perform as the System Integrator (SI) for the DoD Purchase Card Program Management Office to perform tasks associated maintaining and sustaining the Data Mining and Risk Management functions of PCOLS while bringing together the component subsystems of the Purchase card Program into synergy and helping ensure that those subsystems function seamlessly. Such a firm would act as the Purchase Card Program Management Office's primary crossing point to PCOLS vendors, ensuring that business requirements are appropriately interpreted and integrated into the functional and technical architecture. This includes project management, scheduling, requirements gathering, software development, testing, and change control processes in coordination with the Program Management Offices.</p>
<p>Business Objective(s): The over-arching business objective is the adaptation of new technology which can be effectively and affordably deployed in PCOLS quickly by the selected System Integrator (SI). The functional business objective is to mine data from Purchase Card transactions via the deployment of a data-screening tool that uses a combination of discreet DoD-tailored business rules to detect card misuse, and a "neural learning" capability that enables the identification of transactions at the most risk of being fraudulent or abusive. The transactions mined will be screened, scored, and when appropriate, referred-to card mangers for review, and archived. In addition, the system is to "learn" from past transactions to build a knowledge base that improves scoring accuracy over time. This fully scalable risk assessment application will be equal or equivalent-to the current COTs sub-system (FICO's Falcon&reg; Fraud ManagerTM). On a monthly basis, it provides a report card, based on transaction through-put from numerous financial institutions, which identifies and stratifies at-risk transactions, based-on the internal business rules established to ensure robust internal control of card use. This objective also includes the delivery of configurable web-delivered reporting within the confines of DoD Information Assurance regulations, including CAC-enabled single-sign-on for users.</p>
<p>Systems Description: PCOLS includes the DMDC Enterprise Monitoring and Management of Accounts (EMMA) which is used by multiple DoD information systems, Authorization, Issuance, and Maintenance (AIM), Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA). EMMA is an application for the verification and provisioning of credit card officials and their supervisors. AIM is a workflow application for the approval, issuance and maintenance of the purchase card and provides the capabilities to the DM application to screen each purchase card transaction. DM and RA are a combined third party service. The DM algorithms uses DoD specific risk indicators coupled with account profiles, purchase patterns and purchase card transactions with the greatest potential for fraud, waste and abuse in regards to the laws, regulations and policies governing the DoD Purchase Card Program. The RA application provides Approving/Billing Officials (A/BOs), Agency/Organizational Program Coordinators (A/OPCs) and the Office of Program Development Implementation (PDI) with system generated transactions that have been identified at various levels of risk for action and response in the RA application.<br />System Architecture: Closely associated with DM&amp;RA is a sub-system developed by the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) which uses existing DoD personnel data in an integrated workflow to authorize Purchase Cardholder accounts and to process the results of the data mining output. DMDC maintains the historical files on purchase card transactions for the PMO. The selected contractor will be required to work closely with DMDC to ensure well-coordinated integration of these sub-systems.<br />PCOLS Transaction Profile: In FY 2010 DoD issued over 40,000 cards, at any time having approximately 105,783 cards and 48,800 managing accounts and processed 8,884,734 purchase card transactions through the PCOLS application valued at $7,772,622,463.</p>
<p>Vendor Qualifications: The contractor shall exhibit experience as a System Integrator (SI). The contractor will be responsible to possess the necessary facilities, qualified personnel, supplies and equipment necessary to operate as a System Integrator (SI) to connect with the existing FICO Data Mining (DM) and Risk Assessment (RA) applications, or an equal-or-better COTS Data Mining and Risk Assessment application suite that is fully developed and tested. No vapor ware or under-development Data Mining and Risk Assessment applications will be entertained. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The Government anticipates full and open competition procedures for a single award of a Firmed Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), for a base award and four option periods.<br />White Paper Content: Interested companies should submit a white paper that includes a brief description to include the following information:</p>
<p>1. System Integrator (SI) capabilities and experience.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor has a developed and tested COTS application or applications which are equal to or better than the FICO Data Mining and Risk Assessment applications. If yes, provide information on the Data Mining and Risk Assessment applications to include the type of technology for the development and testing of the applications along with deployment histories; and then proceed to Item 3. If no, proceed to Item 3</p>
<p>3. Summary Personnel Qualifications</p>
<p>4. Past experience in Data Mining and Purchase Card Operations</p>
<p>5. Past U.S. Government Contract experience.</p>
<p>6. Facility security clearance level.</p>
<p>7. Technology NAICS Codes in which the offeror normally conducts business.</p>
<p>8. Is the offeror small or large business.</p>
<p>Note: Clearly mark any information that is proprietary.</p>
<p>More information about PCOLS may be located at: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/pcols.html.<br />Vendor Notification: This Market Survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a result of this Market Survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Any information that the responder considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned, including any proprietary information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. All submissions become the property of the Government without restriction as-to their future use.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice that seeks information from potential interested sources for a pending Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case with the Brazilian Government. This is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) and no RFP is available.  

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking information from potential responsible sources for an anticipated partnership with Marine Corps Logistics Command (MARCORLOGCOM.) 

The Marine Corps has a potential requirement consisting of the Brazilian Government purchasing 26 AAV7A1 (22 AAVP7A1, 2 AAVR7A1 and 2 AAVC7A1) Hulls from the U.S. Government and providing an additional 26 AAV Hulls (22 AAVP7A1, 2 AAVR7A1 and 2 AAVC7A1) for upgrade.  These vehicles will be upgraded to the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (RAM/RS) configuration.
 The Contractor would be responsible for the following in support of the RAM/RS upgrade:

-All necessary modifications to 52 Government-furnished AAV hulls that will allow for installation of a modified suspension system and new engine.

-Transportation of 52 Government furnished AAV hulls from MARCORLOGCOM Albany, GA to the Contractor facilities for hull modification and back to MARCORLOGCOM Albany, GA for vehicle upgrade.

-Welding and machining of stripped ballistic aluminum alloy hulls. 

-Capability to lift and maneuver an AAV hull, with approximate dimensions of 130 inches width, 130 inches height, 321 inches length, and 30,000 pounds weight.  

-All vehicle parts necessary to produce the AAV7A1 RAM/RS vehicles to the United States Marine Corps configuration.
  

-Correction of any deficiencies to the Government furnished hulls and major enclosures to be applied to the vehicle assembly process at Maintenance Center (MC) Albany, GA.  Major enclosures include the ramps, ramp doors, plenums, drivers hatches, troop commanders hatches, cargo hatches and crew chiefs hatches.  

-Spares, tools, special tools and test equipment, weapons, special mission kits, training, technical publication development and translation to Portuguese and other Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV7A1) Reliability, Availability, Maintainability (RAM/RS) items per the Brazilian Governments request.  

-OCONUS (Brazil) Field Service Representative (FSR) to provide direct and warranty support for a period of one (1) year.
 

At this time, the acquisition strategy includes MARCORLOGCOM as the responsible party for the rebuild of 52 AAV7A1 vehicles; however, MARCORLOGCOM does not have the facilities to perform the required changes to the AAV hull modifications. The AAV7A1 will be disassembled at MARCORLOGCOM facilities and the hulls will be provided to the contractor for modification in accordance with the Government provided technical data.  

 
It is anticipated that this will be a Government-Contactor work share agreement, and any contract awarded will necessitate a teaming agreement/arrangement between the contactor and MARCORLOGCOM to accomplish the requirement. Interested sources shall possess all the capabilities necessary to perform this effort as the Government does not intend to provide the necessary facilities, equipment or tooling to any contractor for performance of the hull modifications.

Parties interested in providing information in response to this RFI are invited to answer the attached market survey questions, review the attached parts list, special mission kit, technical publication and coordinate with Monica Hurui, Contract Specialist to inspect an AAV hull at MARCORLOGCOM, Albany, GA in order to assist in your Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate.
   Interested parties may inspect the AAV hull August 15  September 9, 2011.  To schedule an appointment, please contact Ms. Hurui at HuruiMF@efv.usmc.mil. 

Responses shall be limited to a total of not more than 30 pages that are not larger than 8  x 11 for each sheet and the font size should be no less than 12 pt.  Reponses in CD format are acceptable, but must be readable in at least Microsoft Office 2003 and/or Adobe Reader Professional 8. 

RFI responses are requested to be received via mail no later than 1400 Hours, local time, on Monday, 31 October 2011 to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Stacey R. Coolican.  Mailing address for response is Marine Corps Systems Command, 14041 Worth Avenue, Attn: Stacey R.
 Coolican, Contracts, Room 150, Woodbridge, VA 22192.  E-mail submission of response is not acceptable. 

NOTE:  This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3. No solicitation document exists at this time. Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these items or to issue a solicitation. Additionally, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice will not be accepted as offers. Any information the vendor considers proprietary shall be clearly marked.

<AWARDEE>United Technologies Corp, Pratt & Whitney, Military Engines, 400 Main Street
, East Hartford, CT 06108 US
<DESC>Pratt &amp; Whitney is the original designer, developer, and manufacturer of the <br />F135 propulsion system and is the only source with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical expertise to produce the F135 propulsion system at the required ramp rate and within the required delivery schedule. P&amp;W is the only source with the facilities and capabilities required to provide the F135 propulsion system and associated sustainment support for the LRIP lot 6 requirements. All prior F135 propulsion system contracts for use in the F-35 Air System have been awarded to P&amp;W on a sole-source basis, pursuant to the <br />F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, approved on 5 December 2008 by the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics), which designated P&amp;W as the sole source to provide the F135 Propulsion System for use in the F-35 Air System.
<p>Pursuant to the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy, the Government did explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, the P&amp;W F135 propulsion system and the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team (FET) F136 propulsion system. The FET was awarded a F136 Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract in 2005. However, in Fiscal Year (FY) 2007 through FY 2011, the FET F136 propulsion system was not included in the Department of Defense Budget. Congress nevertheless provided funding in FY 2007 through FY 2010 for development of the FET F136 propulsion system. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10) enacted on 15 April 2011 did not provide funds for the continued development of the FET F136 propulsion system. On 25 April 2011, the FET F136 SDD contract was terminated for the convenience of the Government. At this point in FY 2011, which is the long-lead advance procurement year for LRIP lot 6, the FET is not a viable source for LRIP lot 6 propulsion requirements. For the reasons cited above, P&amp;W is the only source currently capable of producing and sustaining propulsion systems for LRIP lot 6.</p>
<p>As a result of the FET F136 SDD contract termination, the competition opportunities envisioned in the F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy are not available. The F-35 Lightning II JSF Acquisition Strategy to promote competition was to explore the possibility of two interchangeable propulsion systems, and therefore did not require the purchase of technical data packages for both or either of the F135 propulsion system or F136 propulsion system.&nbsp; As a result, the Government does not have technical data packages suitable for full and open competition of propulsion system efforts for LRIP lot 6.</p>
<p>The contract type is FPIF (firm target) for the install F135 propulsion systems, of which long lead-time materials were purchased under the Advance Acquisition Contract.&nbsp; Per FAR 16.403(b), a FPIF (firm target) contract type is suitable for these efforts because the nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other circumstances of the acquisition are such that the contractor's assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive for effective cost control and performance and provide Government cost insight.</p>

<DESC>The proposed "Trust in Crowds" (TiC)solution will assess the trustworthiness of crowdsourced reports (and reporters)using validated algorithms that explicitly and implicitly exploit dynamic social networks, additional data(e.g., authoriative sources), analyst and crowd feedback, and analysis of report content.&nbsp; The TiC solution will extend existing algorithms through new research and explore hybrid assessment techniques(e.g., combining local and global trust assessment techniques).&nbsp; The results of the trust assessment techniques will be provided to the user in a form that can aid information explotation and decision making.&nbsp; Lastly, the TiC solution will provide a framework that can be extended with new algorithms and that interoperates with a commerical crowdsourcing platform such a Ushahidi.
