<DESC>USAID/Ukraine intends to solicit, on an other than full and open competition basis, professional and technical services to support an ongoing USAID project of Local Economic Development (LED) in Ukraine. Services are required from October 2005 through October of 2007. Services are required in the following functional areas: provide technical assistance to municipalities in implementing strategic plans for economic development; design and implement a local/regional/national program to attract Foreign Direct Investment to Ukrainian cities and support legislative development at the national level to pass and implement a body of law that would codify economic and political autonomy for municipalities.      The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 u.s.c. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.      The government intends to solicit and negotiate with Chemonics International, Washington, DC for this requirement. Chemonics International is currently providing services for the LED project under a competitively awarded contract 121-C-00-04-00708. The work elements described above were originally contemplated for this project.  However, the additional funding was not available, nor was support from the Govt. of Ukraine.  Funding has now been made available and support has been obtained from the Govt. of Ukraine to implement this portion of the project.    Chemonics International is the only firm with the requisite expertise in place that can provide the required services within the context of other LED work activities now under way.    Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.   This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.    However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.     Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.    The Government will not pay for any expenses incurred on preparation and submission of information submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING DESIGN SERVICES FOR
            ROADS REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM 
                               PHASE IV

               
The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is seeking the services of a U.S. Consulting Engineering firm for professional design services for rehabilitation and reconstruction of specified road segments in Gaza and/or the West Bank. 

The selected U.S. Consulting Engineering firm will act as an agent for USAID and provide complete construction documents for specified work effort immediately upon negotiation of a contract and issuance of a Notice to Proceed. The scope of work for the effort will include but not be limited to:
                          
                  Perform site investigation, including soils, pavement, traffic analysis and land    
                  Survey of existing conditions;
Perform environmental investigation as necessary and submit reports sufficient to meet USG and local environmental requirements;  
                  Perform review of records of existing utilities and other site conditions  
                  (including flood and erosion control concerns);
                  Recommend appropriate road design improvements as appropriate for USAID 
                  to negotiate with local authorities;
                  Develop Engineering design to AASHTO standards of specific road segments; 
                  Assist USAID in the preparation of solicitation documents for local 
                  construction contractor;       
                  Assist USAID in the evaluation of proposals if requested;
                  Perform other engineering assistance to USAID related to this scope of work
                  as requested.  

USAID has not yet determined the specific road segments that will be included in the program. It is possible that all road segments will be in the Gaza Strip and selected in accordance with recommendations provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Planning, in coordination with the Palestinian Ministry of Public Works and Housing.  However, due to the Political and Security conditions in Gaza there are constraints and uncertainties which may dictate that the effort be shifted to the West Bank.

Currently, USAID is barred from allowing its contractors from sending Americans, other foreign nationals or dual citizen personnel into Gaza. It is expected that work will be substantially completed by contracting with local Gazan companies to perform all reconnaissance activities and ground proofing in the field. The Successful Consultant firm may desire to employ local Palestinian staff to perform the design effort or may prefer to perform the majority of the design work at their home office.     

In the event that restrictions are lifted when construction activities are expected to begin, USAID may exercise an option to extend the design contract to include construction management services. This Phase IV project is currently funded at the level of $8,000,000, inclusive of design, construction management services and construction efforts on the roads.

Firms interested in submitting their Architect-Engineering qualifications for this project are requested to do so using a Standard Form 330 to Mr. Rick Green, Unit 7228, Box 26, APO AE 09830 no later than 3:00 p.m. Jerusalem time, September 12, 2005. SF 330s sent by courier or hand carried must be delivered to Mr. Rick Green, USAID Office of Contracts Management, Trade Tower Building, 10th Floor, 25 HaMared Street, Tel Aviv Israel no later than 3:00 p.m. local time September 12, 2005.  

All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors:
1.	Specialized experience of the firm (including each member of joint venture or association) with the type of service required;
2.	Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations;
3.	Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules, to the extent such information is available;
4.	 Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel from the organization, including a competent supervising representative having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a similar nature;
5.	 Familiarity with the locality where the project is situated, Gaza and West Bank;
6.	Ability to contract with and work collegially with local Palestinian firms capable of supplying survey, A-E, geotechnical and other necessary services;
7.	Financial capacity. 
8.	Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards provided in FAR subpart 9.1.
9.	Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Agency, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of architect-engineer contracts among qualified firms.

A cost reimbursable indefinite quantity is contemplated for these services with an estimated contract period of September 2005 through August 2006. This notice constitutes USAID’s request for SF 330s and no other document will be issued.

<DESC>Posting: In conjunction with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, the FAA has a requirement to extend the service life of the ARSR-1, ARSR-2, and AN/FPS series radar systems, herein referred to as the Long Range Radar Service Life Extension Program (LRR SLEP).  The scope of the effort includes the design, test, and implementation of a single configuration diplex mode solid-state transmitter to replace the redundant tube-type transmitter assemblies found in the current (68) ARSR-1, ARSR-2, and AN/FPS LRR systems.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for a planned Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract in support of security system requirements for Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, CSOSA.  CSOSA is an independent executive branch federal agency established pursuant to the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA assumed cognizance related to pretrial services, parole, probation and other supervised release functions in, and on behalf of, the District of Columbia. Its mission is to improve public safety, prevent crime, reduce recidivism, and support the fair administration of justice in close collaboration with the community, local and federal authorities. In executing this mission, CSOSA operates from leased spaces throughout the District of Columbia. 

The IDIQ-type contract is intended to provide for quick, cost-effective responses to Agency requirements for installation of new, and repair & maintenance of existing, security systems and/or security system components at various CSOSA sites in the District of Columbia.  The successful contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, and material to install and repair access control security systems, accompanying equipment and associated system components on a firm, fixed price Task Order basis.  All work shall be performed in accordance with the contract specifications and Task Order-specific technical requirements.  Work will vary from site to site and will require extensive knowledge of security systems and an understanding of Federal agency security requirements, including unique CSOSA security requirements.  Schedules for performance will be negotiated on a Task Order basis, however, contractors may be required to meet compressed schedules to deal with emergency or urgent requirements.

Under the planned contract, all installed systems, accompanying equipment and associated system components must be compatible with the present CSOSA legacy systems such as WINPAK 2.0 (release 3), PELCO systems (in order to control access), RADIONICS, as well as function with the existing proximity card-making system, and CCTV system.  The Contractor shall be responsible for properly interfacing all system components, including required connectivity to 633 Indiana Avenue NW, Washington DC.  An interface requires not only a physical connection, but also a matching of signals with regard to impedance, signal level, timing, synchronization and termination. The Contractor shall coordinate all installation and testing of systems and/or system components with CSOSA Security staff. The Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, a one-year warranty agreement on all new systems and / or system components.  The Contractor shall also provide on-site service and repair within 24 hours of notice should new system components fail during the one-year warranty period.  Any perimeter device that fails during the one-year warranty period shall have same business day response.  The Contractor shall respond to all COTR requests for Emergency Service 100% of the time during the period of performance, with definitization to occur after performance.

The IDIQ-type contract will consist of a one-year base and four (4) one-year option periods.  The estimated dollar value is $50,000 for the base and for each of the option periods (total estimated contract value of $250,000).  The minimum Task Order limit under this contract is $2,500 and the maximum is $150,000.  The minimum guaranteed funding for the base and each of the option periods is $5,000, which may be met through the award of a task order.  The Government is not obligated to exercise any of the option periods, but reserves the right to do so on unilateral basis.  The Government also reserves the right to exercise option periods early in the event contract capacity is reached prior to any 12 month period of performance.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) for this requirement shall be issued on or about the 30th of August 2005.  FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures shall be utilized for the award of the planned contract, using a Trade-off between technical and price.  Technical evaluation criteria are weighted in following, descending order of importance: Technical Approach (40%), Personnel Qualifications (35%) and Past Performance (25%).  The technical evaluation criteria, when combined, are equal to price. The closer overall technical ratings are to one another based on evaluation of the offers received, the greater will be the importance of the price proposals in making an award determination.  To be highly rated, firms shall demonstrate adequacy in approach, qualifications and past performance to establish their proposal will provide maximum benefit to the Government. The Government reserves the right to independently verify contractor past performance. The Request For Proposal will be available ONLY on the Internet at the FedBizzOpps website: http://www.eps.gov  Telephone, written or e-mail requests for a hardcopy of the solicitation will not be accepted.

This is an unrestricted procurement; it is open to both large and small businesses.  Therefore, all responsible sources may respond to the Request for Proposal, once issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561621, Security Systems. The small business size standard is $10.5 Million average annual gross revenue over the last three completed fiscal years.  If a large business firm is selected for award, the firm will be required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award. The subcontracting plan shall identify goals for Small Business (SB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman-owned Small Business (WOSB), Veteran-owned Small Business (VOSB) concerns. The required subcontracting plan from large business will be based on the aggregate pricing from the successful firm.  Any planned subcontracting should support the mandatory Agency subcontracting goals of 23 percent for small businesses, with 5 percent for both women-owned and small disadvantaged businesses and 3 percent for HUBZone businesses.  The Service Contract Act applies to this requirement.  Firms must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to receive contract award. To register, visit the CCR website at: http:// www. ccr. gov

The contract requires the provision of half day guided interpretive river raft trips on the 15-mile flat water (no rapids) section of the Colorado River from the Glen Canyon Dam ending at Lees Ferry.  The concessioner will use motorized 22-foot pontoon-type snout boats on a seasonal basis.  The concessioner provides transportation to and from the raft trip locations from their base of operations outside the boundaries of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and in the Page, Arizona area.  The contract also authorizes the provision of full day specialty guided interpretive river raft trips on the 15-mile stretch of the Colorado River and backhauling transportation service for kayak, canoe, and dory boat customers from Lees Ferry to a defined drop off location along the 15-mile stretch of the Colorado River.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the existing concessioner is not a preferred offeror for the contract.  The Prospectus will be issued on August 12, 2005, under the terms described in the Prospectus, with proposals due no later than 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 27, 2005.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA has a need to address training for pilots flying transport category aircraft to enhance their recognition of conditions that might lead to in-flight upsets and to facilitate the appropriate handling of those upsets should they occur.  The FAA is surveying the marketplace to see the extent of interest and capability in meeting these requirements.  Upset events may lead to loss-of control incidents and accidents, and the respondent should demonstrate how this training affords pilots an increased likelihood of successfully recognizing and coping with an upset thereby avoiding an incident or accident.  The training and testing in an in-flight simulator should help identify critical pilot training factors. In its submission, the respondent should demonstrate experience in addressing human factors issues related to the acquisition, transfer, and retention of pilot skills from ground-based simulators to in-flight simulator performance.  They should have at least ten years of proven experience to train and test pilots using in-flight simulation.  They should have a demonstrated history of safe in-flight simulator training.  The in-flight simulation must be capable of emulating transport category aircraft flight characteristics.  Additionally, the respondent should have demonstrated experience in training pilots in aerobatics with emphasis on unusual attitude recovery and accelerated flight. The FAA found one party that meets these requirements.  CALSPAN UB Research Center, Inc. is the incumbent contractor providing these services.  The estimated value of this effort for one year is $500K. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. Parties that can meet this requirement should reply via email, by close of business August 17, 2005 to the Contracting Officer, Carmencita Strange, at carmencita.strange@faa.gov

The Government plans to award a Firm Fixed Price / Time and Materials contract for a base period and two option periods.  

Potential contractors are required to have the knowledge and capability to perform the refurbishment of four Kineto Tracking Mount (KTM) systems. Currently, the Kineto Tracking Mount Program has a need for refurbishment of the KTM systems, which are in various configurations.

It is anticipated the period of performance of the resultant contract will be a basic period (two units) with two option periods (one unit per option). This is based on the most current information available to date. Updated information will be posted electronically on FedBizOps if and when it becomes available. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811219, Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance as a commercial activity, with a size standard of $6,000,000. 

Offerors will be provided 21 days to respond to the RFP once it is released.  A site visit date and time will also be stated within the RFP so that potential offerors could view the units to accurately develop their proposal.  Any Questions and Answers will be posted to this listing to ensure all potential offerors are receiving adequate and equal information. Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. RFP requests will be accepted through the Contracting Office via e-mail or mail carrier. Firms responding to this request shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran- owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.

Interested contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. Interested contractors should ensure any potential organizational conflicts of interest have been, or are in the process of being, mitigated to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. 

We anticipate award of a contract to the successful offeror not later than 28 September 2005.

This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, and it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. Contractors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. 

Please direct any questions on this NOCA to the Contracting Officer, Attn: Steven Barry, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Bldg 2800, Edwards AFB CA 93524, Contracting Officer (tel: 661-277-8884, e-mail: steven.barry@edwards.af.mil) or Gary Cegalis, Contracting Officer (tel: 661-277-8436, e-mail: gary.cegalis@edwards.af.mil).

<DESC>The National Business Center has a requirement to move its Information Technology Operations branch, which is currently located on approximately 1200 square feet of raised floor in Room 100, building 7301.  The environment (i.e. air conditioning and humidity) in room 100, building 7301 is individually controlled, separate from the normal building environment.  New IT requirements have made it impractical to keep the Operations Branch in its current location.  The servers and racks for the new IT requirements must be placed on raised floor for cabling and environmental reasons.  The only available space for the new requirements is the 1200 square feet of raised floor where the Operations Branch is currently located. Prior to installing the new equipment required, the Operations Branch must be relocated to Room 275, building 7301.  However, the environmental situation in room 275, building 7301 must be configured in a like manner to room 100, building 7301.  Room 275 requires equipment to be installed in order to have the required separate environmental controls.  See the RFQ No. NBCQ05536 FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION.

Cancer, for increasing numbers has become a curable illness and for most, a controllable disease. However, it is becoming rapidly apparent that few of our modern therapies are benign. The chronic and late effects of cancer and its treatment can range from mild and transient problems, to serious and at times fatal conditions, and affect all aspects of function: physical, functional, emotional, social, and economic. Over the past decade, CancerCare, Inc. has pioneered educational teleconferences as a means of extending the capacity or ‘reach’ of efforts to communicate important health information. CancerCare’s Telephone Education Workshops have become a highly effective method through which to disseminate information about cancer to as broad an audience as possible – immediately overcoming barriers created by distance, physical disability, and geographic isolation.  The cancer care organization offers approximately 70 to 75 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year.  Based on its 15-year history of producing successful educational cancer-related teleconferences the proposed recipient of the award, CancerCare, initiated and produced the ‘Cancer Survivorship: Living with, Through, and Beyond Cancer’ teleconference series focused on post-treatment issues for cancer survivors and their families and caregivers.  CancerCare, along with its partners, conducted the first three part series in spring of 2003 and two additional series in 2004 and 2005.  Currently, CancerCare, is the exclusive coordinator of the CancerCare: Cancer survivorship teleconference series.  In addition CancerCare’s mailing list, comprised of 15,000 names, represents one of the largest resources for providing outreach to cancer survivors and their families and healthcare professionals interested in education related to cancer survivorship.  Cancer Care is the exclusive coordinator of the Cancer Care: Cancer survivorship teleconference series.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT on August 26, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for Radio Jove Software/Firmware Development, and plan to issue a request for Quotation NG05122513Q to purchase this service from Radio-Sky Publishing in accordance with the requirements of FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  This procurement is for the design, development, and modification of Radio JOVE project software to adapt the project for the blind and severely visually impaired.  Existing Skypipe software developed by Radio-Sky Publishing for operation of the Radio JOVE telescope and spectrographic display software for remote usage of the professional Radio JOVE telescopes is central to the participants in Radio JOVE. In order for the blind or visually impaired to be able to participate, it will be necessary for these software packages to be made usable to them.  Radio–Sky Publishing has detailed knowledge of the existing telescope software and should be able to efficiently sonify the graphical output so that results could be monitored by the blind. There are not sufficient funds to develop these packages again from a beginning point.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time of the response date listed above. Such capabilities  /qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is conducting a progressive competition to define, design, develop, and produce the Crew Exploration Vehicle. Phase I of this effort was a full and open competition for system requirements definition.   Phase II will be for the design, definition, development, and production of the CEV. The initial phase solicitation was described in the March 1, 2005, FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. The initial phase contracts were awarded to: Lockheed Martin Corporation, Space Systems Company; and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, Air Combat Systems on June 24, 2005.   A progressive competition strategy will be used with down-selection of sources from the initial phase to determine the Phase II contractor.  The competition for the Phase II will build on the results of the phase I, and the award criteria for the Phase II includes successful completion of the initial phase requirements identified below.  Accordingly, NASA anticipates that only the Phase I contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the phase II.  A new, formal solicitation will not be issued for the second phase. Instead, proposals will be requested from the initial phase contractors identified as a "Call for Improvement" (CFI).  This will include detailed proposal preparation instructions and evaluation criteria. To be considered for the phase II award, offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the initial phase I contractors.	Such demonstration must include initial phase I deliverables upon which the phase II award will be based.  Prospective offerors for the phase II other than the initial phase contractors will be provided all the material furnished to the initial phase I contractors necessary to submit a proposal. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.  NASA anticipates requesting proposals for the second phase on or about October 1, 2005 and proposals will be due 60 days thereafter. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Prospective offerors other than the phase I contractors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer no later than September 1, 2005.  Any referenced numbered notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted to Keith Hutto not later than August 26, 2005 in writing (e-mail or FAX) e-mail is preferred.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>Procurement Salt Cedar Extraction - Fire Prevention, NAICS 115310  -- The National Park Service (NPS) plans to issue a service contract for salt cedar control by mechanical extrication (with an open backed bucket and thumb) and pile/windrow over a minimum of approximately 220 acres of federal land.  This procurement is to eradicate salt cedar/tamrisk along the Canadian River of Lake Meredith NRA to improve water availability, quality, and habitat improvement, In the Big Canyon area of the park.  The extraction equipment will remove the tap root system of the salt cedars and pile and windrow the salt cedars in all project units.  The majority of the project area is composed of heavy, with pockets of light and medium, density stands of salt cedar, with factors such as terrain, soils, and placement of extricated salt cedar, affecting the amount of time needed to complete the project site. The project site is within the flood plains of the lake or river bottom that has been previously disturbed.  The extricated salt cedar will be piled or windrowed on site in areas specified by NPS fire personnel for future burning.  It is expected that 80 percent of the trees removed will not resprout.  The other 20% may resprout from lateral broken roots and, in that event, they will be chemically treated by NPS later. Raking will not be required.  In some areas, other target species may be included, such as elm or Russian olive, if they are found intermingled with salt cedar.  Non-target species will be left, such as mesquite and cottonwoods.  Some grass species will be sacrificed if growing in the under story of the salt cedar.  Access to the sites will be arranged by Lake Meredith (LAMR) personnel and shall be subject to weather conditions.  All project areas are accessible by roads and no road construction will be needed.  The proposed contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by the NPS.  Quotation submittals will be evaluated on low price technically acceptable, FAR part 15.101-2 applies.  The award will be made to the lowest evaluated price proposal meeting the acceptability standards for non-price factors.  Significant non-price evaluation factors are possession of the machinery necessary to do the task and past performance.  The point of contact for this acquisition is Katie Hoover, Contract Specialist, E-mail katie_hoover@nps.gov, phone number (303) 969-2286, fax number (303) 969-2992.

PLACE OF SUBMISSION: Mr. Lerionka Tiampati, Managing Director, Kenya Tea Development Agency, Ltd. (KTDA), KTDA Farmers Building, Moi Avenue, Nairobi, Kenya, Phone: +254-20-3227000, Fax: +254-20-211240.  Kenya Tea Development Agency Integrated Energy Management Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Kenya Tea Development Agency Integrated Energy Management Project.

The Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), a private Kenyan organization, is the largest smallholder tea organization in the world.  KTDA reports that energy costs represent between 25-40% of the cost of production in the tea production cycle, and is actively seeking ways to limit this cost to ensure the continued productivity of its clients.  In order to help with these concerns, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is providing assistance to examine three aspects of KTDA’s energy requirements: developing mini-hydroelectric power stations at various factories, increasing the factories’ energy efficiency, and securing the supply of biomass fuel for boilers.  The study will identify six sites to conduct a feasibility analysis on the development of mini-hydroelectric power stations, three tea factories for a detailed energy audit, and one tea factory to evaluate forestry practices.   The study is designed to allow other KTDA stakeholders to utilize the results. 

The following is the outline of study:

Task 1: Small Hydropower Reconnaissance
Sub-Task 1A: Selection of Potential Sites
Sub-Task 1B: Preliminary Assessment
Sub-Task 1C: Site Visit

Task 2: Small Hydropower Development
Sub-Task 2A: Pre-feasibility Level Layouts
Sub-Task 2B: Pre-feasibility Assessment
Sub-Task 2C: Economic and Financial Analysis

Task 3: Energy Efficiency
Sub-Task 3A: Energy Audit
Sub-Task 3B: Energy Efficiency Analysis

Task 4: Sustainable Forestry Development
Sub-Task 4A: Existing Resource Evaluation
Sub-Task 4B: Resource Development

Task 5: Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment and Development Impact Assessment

Task 6: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $341,670 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, September 22, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command requires Sustaining Engineering (SE) for the Navy’s UC-35 aircraft beginning January 2006 from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Cessna Aircraft located in Wichita, Kansas.  The UC-35 aircraft, a FAA type-certified commercial cargo/passenger transport aircraft replaced the USN and USMC CT-39 aircraft in performing Operational Support Airlift (OSA) missions.  The UC-35 Cessna aircraft has been modified with Navy required items.  The Navy has procured two UC-35C and eleven UC-35D aircraft to-date from the OEM.  The proposed effort would capitalize on the unique assets and capabilities currently supporting UC-35D acquisitions and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) at Cessna’s facilities.  This procurement is to acquire access to proprietary OEM engineering information, maintenance data, in-place production and technical resources needed to support the aircraft and provide OEM unique information and publications. The Marine UC-35 is a relatively new aircraft, a derivative of the Cessna Citation V Ultra/Encore, and was first introduced in 1999.  Due to the UC-35’s short in-service history and limited deployment, Cessna is the only complete source of historical, developmental, design, manufacturing, modification, and logistics support and test certification data for the Navy unique UC-35 aircraft.  Cessna is the only source for providing OEM unique off-site engineering support and depot level maintenance support required to sustain fleet operations.  No other source would have access to the developmental information and thus cannot provide the required support during the acquisition and follow-on depot CLS of the UC-35.  Therefore, the only source that can provide the necessary OEM unique support in the timeframe required is Cessna.  This proposed procurement should provide for the procurement of engineering services estimated worth $100,000 annually for a base and four one-option years.  Additional services may be procured to support unique requirements such as accident investigations or engineering investigations. See Note 22

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit (MOCRU)), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Meso Scale Discovery, 9238 Gaither Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20877 for a  Sector Imager 2400. The Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit has been working on a project to determine the effect of investigative drugs on the intended molecular targets and their biological effects on the target cancer cells and is to discover potential biomarkers and surrogate marker in correlative studies during clinical trials. This requires the analysis of biological samples obtained from treated patients, often as tumor core biopsies with a very limited number of cells.  The samples are extremely limiting, therefore, the technology requirements for analyzing the samples are very high:  robust, reliable and extremely sensitive.  It is also required that specific assays for plasma or urine biomarkers be rapidly developed and evaluated.  The assays need to be highly sensitive, quantitative, and reliable.  The electrochemluminescence (ECL) technology of the Sector Imager 2400 has a number of features that make it uniquely suitable for the clinical investigations as follows: capability to detect as little as 100,000 molecules of analytes and 25 attomoles of tag, capability to detect both total and phosphor-EGFR in as little as 30 ng cell lysates (160 cells worth) of A431 cells, capability to detect phosphor-ERK in 80 ng of stimulated Jurkat cell lysates where the signal to baseline ratio is about 600% with a CV of 5%, a signal dynamic range of about 4 logs,  capability to analyze up to 100 clinical specimens a day with quantitation and CVs in a discovery research environment, has multiplexing capability to examine multiple markers simultaneously in the same test wells. In the case of EGFR, both total and phosphor EGFR can be examined in the same wells in a 96-well plate. Other specific features required to provide the measurements that we are making include a nitrogen backfilled, front-illuminated Peltier cooled CCD camera with -25 °C operating temperature or lower, 1024 x 1024 or greater imaging pixels, and minimum 24 µm resolution.  The digital image must have a dynamic range of 16 bits or greater.  The instrument must have automated positioning for maximum signal, automated rotational check, background subtraction, defect map correction and cosmic ray correction.  The plate reader portion of the instrument must be compatible with 24, 96, 384 and 1536 well formats, and the instrument must be capable of 100,000 or more determinations per day.
The Meso Scale Diagnostic Sector Imager 2400 specializes in the developing of assays against biological markers. Due to this availability of validated assays and the ability to develop new assays there is no other source known to the NCI researcher for this product. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are not authorized. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EDT on August 22 , 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist on gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. It is the contractor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to verify questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS: 334517.  Size standard: 500 employees. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and  planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements of Aeronautical System Center,  Comptroller Directorate (ASC/FM), located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433.  Services, detailed below, include providing a wide range of support related to  the use, operation, training, maintenance and improvement of the CCaR  application, in both Program Offices or Wings/Groups/Squadrons and at the  Staff level. ASC utilizes the client-server and web versions of CCaR, so  services required are applicable to both versions. Contractor support  personnel are expected to be expert in all facets of CCaR functionality and  operation. Contractor support personnel must also be familiar with the  applications and systems with which CCaR interfaces. Contractor support  personnel must demonstrate familiarity with:  DFAS BQ and MOCAS systems, and  Air Force CRIS, ConWrite + SMART systems. Contractor support personnel must be  capable of teaching all aspects of CCaR utilization to all ASC personnel, with  ability to recommend how CCaR should be employed to best support the unique  mission requirements of every ASC office. Contractor support personnel must  have a means of staying proficient with current CCaR functionality, which has  three major releases every year and maintenance releases once a month.  Responses must clearly address the ability to provide all services, identified  below. Contractor support personnel must have knowledge in Air Force  accounting + finance, financial management, contracts management and program  management, to include knowledge of DOD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  Execution (PPBE) process and knowledge of Air Force Weapon System Acquisition  process, as CCaR supports a significant number of acquisition and functional  processes and products for both USAF and Foreign Military Sales. Contractor  support personnel must have a current security clearance at the Secret level.  ASC’s workload fluctuates over time and any responses must address the ability  to respond in a reasonable amount of time to additional requirements for  contractor support. Of particular importance, each response must clearly elucidate and expound  upon the approach, technique and any ancillary relationships, contract  agreements or vehicles, etc. which they have with Integrated Data Service  (IDS). IDS is the developer of CCaRS, and currently provides both maintenance,  change management, configuration control, design, development, testing and  installation of the CCaR application, all CCaR modules, Looking Glass data  warehouse for the client-server and web versions along with web part design,  development and test and installation of production software products.  Responses must clearly indicate how their employees acquire knowledge, skills,  abilities and training on all CCaR applications and related products.  Demonstration of a seamless process of working with IDS is paramount, as  contractor support personnel have been and are expected to be, very  knowledgeable and familiar with the CCaR application and related products.  Specifically address how employees receive training initially and continually  as major functionality releases occur three times a year. Specifically address  how contractor support personnel will work with USAF and FMS customers in  regards to problems, bugs, enhancements and in turn work with IDS for  resolution to problems and bugs. Also address the process by which contractor  support personnel will clearly communicate the functionality needs of their  customers. Contractor support personnel will be involved with testing new  functionality. Address the process by which prospective contractor support  personnel are evaluated for having an affinity to grasp new concepts, new  processes and new tools. Clearly demonstrate a seamless process between  yourself and IDS which shows how the Air Force will not be responsible for  managing the relationship between these parties in order to provide  outstanding customer support, resulting in successful utilization of CCaR to  support weapon system acquisition offices. Contractor support personnel must demonstrate an understanding of all  functionality as documented in the CCaR users’ manual. CCaR is a relational  database application. Contractor support personnel must understand how  relational databases function so they can properly configure and maintain the  database front end through the Supervisor’s screen processes, and instruct  their customers in the proper procedures for utilizing any of the  functionality inherent in the database. Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the following CCaR functionality on  the part of your company in general and specifically your employees, who would  be providing CCaR support.  Contractor support personnel need to understand  the following functionality so they are the CCaR expert within their assigned  office and have the ability to explain the functionality to their  customers/CCaR users. •	CCaR Modes •	Custom system tailoring •	Requirements Tracking •	Automated funding status •	Electronic workflow •	Funding document generation •	ABSS Interface •	BQ Interface

<DESC>Support Services for Comprehensive Cost and Requirements (CCaR) System SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and  planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements of Aeronautical System Center,  Comptroller Directorate (ASC/FM), located at Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433.  Services, detailed below, include providing a wide range of support related to  the use, operation, training, maintenance and improvement of the CCaR  application, in both Program Offices or Wings/Groups/Squadrons and at the  Staff level. ASC utilizes the client-server and web versions of CCaR, so  services required are applicable to both versions. Contractor support  personnel are expected to be expert in all facets of CCaR functionality and  operation. Contractor support personnel must also be familiar with the  applications and systems with which CCaR interfaces. Contractor support  personnel must demonstrate familiarity with:  DFAS BQ and MOCAS systems, and  Air Force CRIS, ConWrite + SMART systems. Contractor support personnel must be  capable of teaching all aspects of CCaR utilization to all ASC personnel, with  ability to recommend how CCaR should be employed to best support the unique  mission requirements of every ASC office. Contractor support personnel must  have a means of staying proficient with current CCaR functionality, which has  three major releases every year and maintenance releases once a month.  Responses must clearly address the ability to provide all services, identified  below. Contractor support personnel must have knowledge in Air Force  accounting + finance, financial management, contracts management and program  management, to include knowledge of DOD’s Planning, Programming, Budgeting,  Execution (PPBE) process and knowledge of Air Force Weapon System Acquisition  process, as CCaR supports a significant number of acquisition and functional  processes and products for both USAF and Foreign Military Sales. Contractor  support personnel must have a current security clearance at the Secret level.  ASC’s workload fluctuates over time and any responses must address the ability  to respond in a reasonable amount of time to additional requirements for  contractor support. Of particular importance, each response must clearly elucidate and expound  upon the approach, technique and any ancillary relationships, contract  agreements or vehicles, etc. which they have with Integrated Data Service  (IDS). IDS is the developer of CCaRS, and currently provides both maintenance,  change management, configuration control, design, development, testing and  installation of the CCaR application, all CCaR modules, Looking Glass data  warehouse for the client-server and web versions along with web part design,  development and test and installation of production software products.  Responses must clearly indicate how their employees acquire knowledge, skills,  abilities and training on all CCaR applications and related products.  Demonstration of a seamless process of working with IDS is paramount, as  contractor support personnel have been and are expected to be, very  knowledgeable and familiar with the CCaR application and related products.  Specifically address how employees receive training initially and continually  as major functionality releases occur three times a year. Specifically address  how contractor support personnel will work with USAF and FMS customers in  regards to problems, bugs, enhancements and in turn work with IDS for  resolution to problems and bugs. Also address the process by which contractor  support personnel will clearly communicate the functionality needs of their  customers. Contractor support personnel will be involved with testing new  functionality. Address the process by which prospective contractor support  personnel are evaluated for having an affinity to grasp new concepts, new  processes and new tools. Clearly demonstrate a seamless process between  yourself and IDS which shows how the Air Force will not be responsible for  managing the relationship between these parties in order to provide  outstanding customer support, resulting in successful utilization of CCaR to  support weapon system acquisition offices. Contractor support personnel must demonstrate an understanding of all  functionality as documented in the CCaR users’ manual. CCaR is a relational  database application. Contractor support personnel must understand how  relational databases function so they can properly configure and maintain the  database front end through the Supervisor’s screen processes, and instruct  their customers in the proper procedures for utilizing any of the  functionality inherent in the database. Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the following CCaR functionality on  the part of your company in general and specifically your employees, who would  be providing CCaR support.  Contractor support personnel need to understand  the following functionality so they are the CCaR expert within their assigned  office and have the ability to explain the functionality to their  customers/CCaR users. •	CCaR Modes •	Custom system tailoring •	Requirements Tracking •	Automated funding status •	Electronic workflow •	Funding document generation •	ABSS Interface •	BQ Interface

INTRODUCTION
TRICARE is the name of the Department of Defense’s managed health care program for active duty military, active duty service families, retirees and their families, and other beneficiaries.  For more information about TRICARE, please feel free to visit: http://www.tricare.osd.mil. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) E-Commerce System is a centralized Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that provides contracting, accounting, and budgeting functions for TMA.
BACKGROUND
The TMA E-Commerce project plans to update an existing document capture sub-system that is currently deployed in a centralized environment at TMA’s facility in Aurora, 
Colorado.  The existing system consists of 2 high speed scanners that process a total of about 10,000 paper pages per month. The current document capture sub-system is based on a desktop class scanning package. 
PURPOSE
TMA desires to modify the existing document capture sub-system in order to:
-  Reduce the resource effort and user interaction currently required to process, 	scan, OCR, and load paper documents into Documentum. 
-  Improve Quality Control (QC) review to allow for easier correction of errors.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFIED SOLICITATION NOTICE IS TO MODIFY THE PHASE I ISSUING DATE TO ON OR ABOUT 30 SEPTEMBER 2005. ALL OTHER INFORMATION REMAINS UNCHANGED. 
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED UNRESTRICTED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FIVE (5) SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) DESIGN-BUILD/100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH TWO MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8(a), HUBZONE, OR SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN CONTRACTOR.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236210: Industrial Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Task Orders will primarily consist of new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure including: 1) aviation and aircraft facilities, 2) marine facilities, 3) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 4) administrative facilities, 5) warehouses and supply facilities, 6) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs), for the Area of Responsibility (AOR) of ROICC Key West, FL.Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that will result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered. Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options.  The total 5 year (base year and 4 option years) estimated construction costs for all of the IDIQ contracts is NTE $30,000,000. Projects will vary in size from around $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00. The minimum guarantee is $25,000.00 for each contract. If a minimum of two (2) offerors remain in the pool during contract duration, this will satisfy the competitive requirements and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the offerors is excluded from participation in the process.  This procurement will include potential award for two (2) 8(a) eligible, HUBZone eligible or Service Disabled Veteran eligible contractors.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II.  If an 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such. The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven (7) proposers (design-build teams), unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than seven (7) is in the Government’s interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase design build contracting. The narrowing phase is based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Experience, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including and not limited to asbestos, lead paint and  PCBs), and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor (two) that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than two 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractors with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  The successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  Otherwise eligible 8(a), HUBZone, and Service Disabled Veteran contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8(a), HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The offeror with the best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST FIVE CONTRACTS.  THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE.  PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF $25,000; THE HIGHEST RATED OF THOSE FIVE WILL BE AWARDED THE SEED PROJECT THAT WILL BE THE FIRST TASK ORDER.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 22 June 2005.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Lynda Frattone, Procurement Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 757-5936, Fax (301) 757-5946, Email Lynda.Frattone@navy.mil
<DESC>CORRECTED NOTICE: RESPONSE DATE IS 12 SEPTEMBER 2005.  This Special Notice is to inform Industry that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD desires to continue its exchanges with industry in its planning of the JPALS Acquisition Strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that enables military aircraft to safely execute approaches to landing when ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program with the Navy, Air Force and Army as its participants.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link, and Inertial Navigation System (Sea Based only).  The JPALS program requirements also include civil interoperability for all airborne platforms and land based installations. 

A competitive, performance-based specification RFP for the JPALS SDD effort is currently planned for release in the second quarter of FY06, resulting in a Best Value source selection award early in the fourth quarter of FY06.  In this best value source selection, the Government is considering awarding one or more contracts to qualified offerors.  The Government would allocate a set amount of funding per offeror and carry the offerors to a down select event.  At the downselect, the Government would exercise an option contract line item to continue with the contractor determined to provide the best value to the Government. 

The JPALS Program requests Industry provide feedback on this proposed strategy.  Specifically, the Government wishes to know:

a.	What are the perceived risks with the proposed down select strategy?

b.	Assuming $20M is available to each of the initially selected offerors, what tasks could be completed for the proposed funding? What are the “planning number” costs/man-hours associated with each task.  What is the timeline for completing these tasks?

c.	If $20M was taken out of the equation, what tasks could be completed within the timeframe if the Government determined that the down select event would occur about 1 month after the SFR (currently planned for 4QFY07).  What are estimated “planning number” costs/man-hours associated with each task?  What are the associated costs if the Government were to go to PDR, 2QFY08?

Responses should be presented as a top-level schedule depicting major tasks and events.  For each task and event please provide a description of the task/event and associated costs.  

Interested parties should periodically check the PMA-213 web site, https://pma213.navair.navy.mil/jpals_industry, for updated information on JPALS.  Industry members are encouraged to respond to these questions and provide additional/alternative inputs.

Other comments and suggestions regarding the Government's course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.  It is requested all written responses and comments be received no later than 4:00 PM on Monday, 12 Sep 2005.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), an 8(a) firm, or a large business (L).  Further, please indicate the firm’s desire as to whether it it is at the prime or subcontractor level for the upcoming SDD.

Points of Contact:  Responses and inquiries should be e-mailed to the following individuals:

Lynda Frattone - Lynda.Frattone@navy.mil, Contracting Officer/AIR-2.2.1.3, telephone (301) 757-5936; and Jeff Semenza – Jeff.Semenza@navy.mil, Program, Plans and Controls/PMA21352 telephone (301) 995-6267.
An alternate contact for inquiries is Herb Hause, Herb.Hause@navy.mil, JPALS Operations/ PMA21352A, telephone (301) 995-6266.

Note:  This Special Notice is provided for planning purposes only and is subject to change. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.

<SUBJECT>B -- UAV Battlelab Dynamic Spectrum Management and Allocation Tool Broad Agency Announcement FY05
<SOLNBR>BAA-UAVB-05-003
<RESPDATE>081006
<ARCHDATE>08112006
<CONTACT>David Huber, Contracting Officer, Phone 702-652-3366, Fax 702-652-3367, Email david.huber@nellis.af.mil - Micah O'Neal, Contract Specialist, Phone 702-652-5401, Fax 702-652-3367, Email micah.oneal@nellis.af.mil
<DESC>A.         THIS IS A BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA UAVB 05-0003) FOR UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE DYNAMIC SPECTRUM MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION TOOL CAPABILITY.

B.         INTRODUCTION 

A software-based tool is needed to assist in frequency management and coordination in a dynamic environment.  As Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) proliferate the battlespace, lack of available spectrum is becoming a critical issue.  The traditional way that Joint-level spectrum managers allocate and deconflict frequency assignments is largely a static process and inefficient.  A dynamic process is needed to allow the sharing and re-use of frequencies on a mission-by-mission, day-by-day basis, e.g., through an ATO-like process.  Rather than have spectrum assigned "permanently" to (and owned by) a particular unit, units should receive frequencies as needed based on the specific requirements for a given mission.  The spectrum resources should be managed/controlled/coordinated in a similar manner as that which currently exists for managing the airspace.  The system needs to be flexible enough to factor in mission locations, en-route/egress flight paths, mission altitudes, TX range requirements, frequency congestion areas, etc.  If an RPA unit stands down for WX outage, the frequency bandwidth they normally need should be available for use by other RPA platforms.   When the RPA is on-station over the target area, the frequencies needed during takeoff at the FOL 300 miles away should be temporarily marked as available for other users. The UAV Battlelab is interested in any systems that would be able to perform this dynamic spectrum management and allocation function. 


C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of a MATURE TECHNOLOGY.

2)Automatic Point Dendrometer, Qty. 6 Each
3)Automatic Band Dendrometer, Qty 3 Each.
Product Specification Requirements: Accurate measures of intra-annual incremental tree growth is necessary for validating forest growth models used in risk assessment. Manually read band dendrometers are being used currently to provide such data in Pacific Northwest forests. However, a major factor in interpreting these data is the influence of the bark tissues on seasonal changes in basal area. To resolve this uncertainty, a combination of automatic band and point dendrometers are needed: the point dendrometers provide a measure of all tissues. Bark changes are determined by difference. A series of automated point and band dendrometers linked to a common Data Collection and Analysis System (the POD) is required in order to resolve the complex time-series data streams. In order to meet our scientific requirements outlined above, the following technical requirements for the automatic point and band dendrometers are as follows: (1) Band Dendrometers shall be able to measure radial growth in Coniferous trees with diameters between 50cm adn 500cm. (2) Both Dendrometer styles shall have a resolotion of 2mm or better and shall have a measurement range of 15mm. (3) Dendrometers shall output data signals that can be read by a single datalogging system that operates off 12 VDC, has RS232 data output capability and shall store data using non-volatile memory.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
I.  PURPOSE
The Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) is seeking sources for a possible future acquisition. This RFI solicits the contractors’ interest and capability to meet stated objectives, and is for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Respondents to this RFI will form the basis of a selected bidders list concerning any subsequent PM ISE RFP actions relevant to Electronic Directory Services or the functional equivalent.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997):
1.	The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs of the FAR.
2.	Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal.
3.	This solicitation is issued for the purpose of determining interested contractors for the proposed ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) acquisition.
This RFI serves two purposes: 1) to inform the Government on the type and scope of work expected; and, 2) to receive information and feedback on interest and capabilities of potential sources. We request that contractors replying to this RFI provide a response to each of the questions listed in Section III.
II. BACKGROUND
The intent of this RFI is, consistent with the direction in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004, to provide Electronic Directory Services (EDS), or the functional equivalent, to enable authorized participants to locate and access information, organizations, services and personnel in support of their respective mission requirements for terrorism information. Recognizing that successful counterterrorism efforts require an effective information sharing capability, section 1016 of the IRTPA requires creation of an information sharing environment (ISE) for counterterrorism information in a manner consistent with national security and the information privacy and other legal rights of Americans. In accordance with the INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT (IRTPA), the INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT (ISE) will reflect the combination of policies, procedures, and technologies linking the resources of the Federal, State, local and tribal governments, the private sector, and foreign allies, to facilitate information sharing, access, and collaboration among users to combat terrorism effectively. The ISE will support the sharing and access to terrorism information, which includes information from the intelligence, law enforcement, military, homeland security and other communities. Section 1016 further specifies that the ISE will have an ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) capability or the functional equivalent.
The ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) is intended to enable authorized users, including operators, analysts, responders, planners and policy makers, to locate and access information, organizations, services and personnel in support of their respective mission requirements. This includes finding experts and possible collaboration partners.  Therefore, this RFI is intended to seek ideas from the broadest possible audience to meet the needs of each of the users of the EDS. Responses should describe what the EDS capability will look like as it matures, identify an initial capability that could be established in the short term (30-60 days), and what a phased approach would provide for a mid- and long-term expansion (1 and 3 years, respectively). An initial capability must at a minimum, contain terrorism information and be accessible to the Federal government with a clear path for early expansion to State, local, and tribal officials, law enforcement, the private sector, and foreign allies. The rough order of magnitude capacity of the ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) for the long term is thousands of organizations and, potentially, millions of individual users, and hundreds of thousand or millions of accesses each day.
III. RFI QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSE
Based on information provided in response to this RFI, the PM INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENT (ISE) will determine the potential offeror’s capability to perform functions as described in this RFI.  Respond in the provided Question/Answer format for each question in the RFI Questionnaire section.  The Government recognizes that many potential offerors will only have information pertaining to a portion of this RFI.  However, this limited “best of breed” information could still be of high quality and significant value to the ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY SERVICES (EDS) initiative. Therefore, while the government seeks an EDS solution, it does not discourage partial responses. If you choose not to respond to a question, indicate “no response” and indicate the rationale.  No more than 20 total single-sided pages with print no smaller than 12 point is suggested; however, text included in graphics, tables, and figures can be smaller than 10 point. The submissions must be in sufficient detail and clarity to provide the information needed to assess your solution approach.  Marketing material and reference material may be placed in appendices.  Responses must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 or later.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command is issuing this sources sought synopsis in support of the C-130 aircraft modernization program.  The Navy is looking to upgrade the avionic subsystems for the Navy KC-130T and C-130T aircraft.  The desired modernization solution will be accomplished by replacing aging, unreliable equipment and adding additional equipment necessary to meet Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The end solution will reduce parts obsolescence and maintenance work and reduce cockpit crew size to provide increased situational awareness to the flight crew.  The solution will also provide full internal and external night vision compatible lighting in an integrated open system architecture to reduce the impact of future upgrades.  The modernization solution should reuse appropriate exist aircraft systems as well as integrate the existing defensive systems.  The Navy desires to leverage off existing modernization programs, solutions and proven technology.  Interested parties should submit a brief capability statement which details current or recent experience in providing similar aircraft modernization solutions.  Capability statements are requested no later than close of business Thursday 17 August. Contact information is as follows: mail to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A.

Macro-Analysis of 
Commander, Navy Installations
Efforts to Improve
Ashore Readiness

STATEMENT OF WORK



Period of Performance:  Contract Award through 16 SEP 2005.

1.0	Background:

Commander, Navy Installations (CNI) was created to consolidate and create efficiencies within the Navy's ashore readiness domain.  Since its stand up in October 2003, CNI has implemented many private sector business practices, including:

a.	Implementing ABCM
b.	Standardizing organizational alignment, processes and outputs across the enterprise
c.	Creating and refining quantifiable and pricable program output levels

k.	Performs EOY annual review on actual performance and customer satisfaction
l.	Several cost savings mitigations

CNI comprises the Navy’s ashore installation domain, both CONUS and OCONUS.  CNI comprises approximately 97 installations covering over 2M acres and over $180B in facility plant value.  CNI is responsible for resources and policy for the following ashore functions:

a.	Air Operations
b.	Port Operations
c.	Other Operations
d.	Personnel Support
e.	Housing (bachelors and families)
f.	Facility Support
g.	Facility Planning
h.	Environmental
i.	Public Safety

Since its inception, CNI, through efficiencies and focused efforts to deliver the right service at the least cost, has creating over $11B in returned savings to the Navy across the future years defense program (FYDP).  Despite these remarkable achievements, continuing challenges exist in achieving and maintaining acceptable levels of ashore readiness which support our warfighters.  CNI desires to obtain an objective review of how it is performing in delivering ashore readiness to its customers.  

2.0 Objective:  The objective of this effort is to provide an independent, third party, macro level, business process-focused analysis of CNI's efforts to date in improving ashore readiness.  Ashore readiness is defined as the quantity and quality of delivered ashore programs from the viewpoint of the resource providers  (cost of the services), the program managers (implementing required services to meet customer needs), and the customers (quality of the service).

More concisely, we desire to understand:

a.  The expectations of the customer in regards to both programmed, and desired service level outputs
b.  The program director/manager’s ability to provide the mandated service levels
c.  The resource provider’s satisfaction in the mandated service levels verses what is being provided in the field

The contractor will be required to: collect and analyze pertinent budget and financial planning data; visit 1 European Navy base and 5 CONUS Navy installations (specific sites identified below); interview various functional and program managers, customers (end users), and resource providers; review current and planned CNI process improvements; review pre and post CNI ashore output levels and associated costs; compare your findings to other ashore readiness providers (both private and public sector) and finally present results to CNI NLT 16 SEP 2005.

3.0 Analysis Specifics:

3.1 On-site visits.
o	Interview customers (end users), process owners and support personnel.
o	Gather and review pertinent business process improvement data.
o	Gather and review pertinent budget, financial and planning data
o	Review current service output levels, comparing actual output verses stated/budgeted output
o	Review attainment of service output levels from the viewpoint of the customer, process owners and resource providers.
o	Interview customers to obtain what service output levels are required, and desired

3.2 Off-site work.
o	Prepare macro-level comparison of visited sites’ process improvement implementation status and organizational alignment maps
o	Develop baseline (pre-CNI) and current (post-CNI) review of actual service level outputs and compare against actual costs to deliver those services
o	Identify possible areas for improvement and operational/financial benefits.

4.0 Task Description and Deliverables
	
4.1 Pre-On-site Coordination/Data Collection.  Coordinate as required to organize, plan and schedule the Analysis tasks.  Collect preliminary data for use as background information for analysis team.
Deliverables:  Preliminary site visit/interview schedule, background data package for Analysis, and briefing materials for site visits.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Thermal Lyser Microarray
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is working towards developing compact systems that combine microfluidics, microarray discrimination, and microarray imaging to efficiently prepare, bind and detect sample target biomolecules.  Rapid discrimination of biomolecules such as gene sequences and proteins originating from viruses, bacteria, plants, algae, and eukaryotes such as mammalian cells is useful in a variety of fields, for example health care, food safety, drug testing and bioweapons defense.  Processes that rapidly solubilize a wide variety of biological agents, including difficult to lyse bacterial spores have also been developed to facilitate sample preparation.  The combination of our microarray and sample preparation technologies could lead to novel products that allow for the lysis, concentration, purification, and analysis.
  

Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partners to be a part of this exciting effort.  Of particular value would be industrial participants with experience in providing a path to market following a successful prototype demonstration.  Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/ or commercial licenses.  Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation.  CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

<SUBJECT>59 INDUSTRY DAY FOR COMMON ENTERPRISE DISPLAY SYSTEMS (CEDS), FORMERLY THE FUTURE COMMON DISPLAY  SYSTEM (FCDS)
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). NAVSEA has an enterprise requirement for design, development, qualification and production of a family of common display systems that are compliant with Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) requirements and implement Human Systems Integration (HSI) design techniques.  These display systems are intended to be implemented across platform systems on Navy surface ships, submarines, and aircraft interfacing with the platform Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE) network infrastructure to support Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Hull, Mechanical and Electrical systems (HM&E) display requirements.  These display systems will be procured through the Common Enterprise Display System (CEDS) program, an ACAT III program, which was formerly known as the Future Common Display System (FCDS) program.   It is anticipated that the competitive request for proposal (RFP) will result in a fixed price type contract(s) for the preliminary design of CEDS.  The contract(s) will contain a follow-on cost type option item for CEDS development and a fixed price type option for CEDS production.

Technical Requirements:

Mast for JBS(V2)D Project

Background

The JBS(V2)D system is a transportable communication suite designed for tactical deployment in various theaters of operation by the United States Special Forces. This application requires a portable and adaptable lightweight mast system for deployment of the antenna array.  This requirement and resulting mast system is considered commercial in nature.

Requirements
·	The mast system must be capable of supporting the antennas listed below.
1.	CSA longshot - a 500-foot long wire antenna. It is important to note that the 500-foot long wire antenna requires a mast capable of sustaining 90 pounds pull at the top of the mast in a single direction. This is the approximate force required to properly deploy the long wire antenna.
2.	AS3166, VHF-FM low bands  
3.	DC80, VHF and UHF frequency bands
4.	AT197 A/GR, UHF and AM Bands
5.	SC303B, SATCOM
·	The mast system must include any adapters needed to afix the identified antennas to the mast system being proposed.
·	The mast systems must be lightweight enough to be one man portable, therefore maximum allowable weight for any one given bag is 110 pounds.
·	The masts must be deployable by a trained individual within 15-20 minutes, depending on wind conditions.
·	Due to the variety of environments in which the masts will be deployed, the mast systems must be comprised of corrosion free materials and sealed components where possible to prevent the detrimental effects of sand and dirt.
·	The mast solution must be capable of supporting fifty pounds up to a height of fifteen meters. 
·	The mast systems must allow the operators to change antennas during a mission in 5 minutes, excluding antenna assembly time.  This could be accomplished via a winching system with a carriage assembly. The carriage assembly must be capable of elevating the antennas and hold them in place without listing beyond functional deployment. The accessory arms on the carriage assembly must be capable of optional lengths from 24 inches to 48 inches. There must also be an option to use the accessory arms at different angles to provide proper separation of large antennas. 
·	The mast systems must accommodate deploying at least two antennas simultaneously. 
·	The mast systems must be capable of operational wind speeds of seventy miles per hour. 
·	The mast systems must also be able to be loaded onto a 436L pallet without the need for special accommodations, such as special racks. 

Proposal Submission & Evaluation

Award will be made to the responsive, responsible Offeror whose offer is found to be technically acceptable and evaluated as the lowest cost to the Government.  In order to be adjudged technically acceptable an offer must meet all of the above-described requirements.  In addition the Offeror should provide product technical specification literature, not to exceed 4 pages in length, and any associated parts lists, not to exceed 2 pages in length, describing their offered mast system.  The submitted product technical specification literature and associated parts lists will be reviewed by the Government to determine technical acceptability of offered mast system and compliance with the above described requirements.  The product literature should clearly define all terms (e.g. military grade) and described how specified ranges (e.g. operating & storage temperature ranges, maximum operational wind speed, etc.) were developed and verified.  Product literature should also clearly indicate what corrosion free materials/processes are being utilized.

In addition to a proposal for seventy-six (76) mast systems, the Government will also entertain and may evaluate a proposal for seventy-six (76) mast systems coupled with an offer to accept in-trade seventy-six (76) Government owned new/unused Old Stone Incorporated/Antenna Mast Systems OSEZ-CF-48 Mobile Masts.  These mast systems available for trade-in will include the Tripod Assembly, Center Mast Poles, EZ Raze Lifting System, Base Plates, Guy Assemblies, Ground Stakes, Hammers, and Carry Bag.  It is important to note that the Government is currently looking into other possible uses within the Government for these potential trade-in mast systems and may not evaluate the trade-in aspect of the proposal.  Offerors who wish to provide a proposal for the mast systems and the seventy-six (76) trade-in mast systems should clearly differentiate said proposals in their submission.

Offerors submitting proposals should submit as a minimum a proposal under CLIN 0001 for the seventy-six (76) mast systems without a trade-in provision.  Offerors may submit a proposal under optional CLIN 0002 for seventy-six (76) mast systems with the trade-in provision.  Inclusion of optional CLIN 0002 in the evaluation process is dependent on 1) if any offer for the optional trade-in is submitted, and 2) if other uses for these seventy-six (76) OSEZ-CF-48 Mobile trade-in Mast systems cannot be found by the Government.  It is important to note that regardless of whether optional CLIN 0002 is evaluated or not the maximum number of mast systems to be procured as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation is seventy-six (76).  Award will be made based on the lowest evaluated cost submission from among those Offerors who have been adjudged to have submitted technically acceptable proposals.

The back-up server will be integrated into the existing system. Therefore, the two servers must be identical to ensure proper interoperability, reduce program risk, and maintain program continuity without disruption to the mission.<br> The NCS is run by proprietary software.  The software configured for these systems is highly-specialized air defense software, specifically developed for the hardware listed in the SOW. This proprietary software is not operable on any other hardware.<br> Acquisition of an identical server reduces program risk. In the event of a catastrophic failure of both servers, components from both can be used to rebuild one functional unit.<br> Onsite technicians have been specially trained on this hardware. Substitutions in hardware and/or components will require extra training for the onsite techs, additional funds for that training, and will increase program risk by introducing unknown / untested factors into the existing architecture and jeopardizing operational capabilities of the system.<br> According to market research, substitute hardware would break NCS configuration management, leaving the program without comprehensive engineering analysis to test and certify system compatibility from an OSS&E standpoint. <br>  Accordingly, I find that other companies' similar products do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet the specific requirements for the NCS system.  These requirements can only be met by the equipment (server / components) listed in the NCS RFQ FA8722-05-C-0007 SOW.<br> <br> //signed//<br> Rex Steves CC2SG/PK <br> Contracting Officer<br> 11 Eglin St. Bldg 1618,<br> Hanscom AFB, MA 01731<br> (781) 377-2236<br> <br> Numbered note 1 applies

Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-8514), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self.  The program’s design will  increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration.   Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.

	The program will enlist  partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change.  Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.

The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.    

Past performance and price shall not be evaluated on quotes determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability evaluation criteria.

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  
Offerors shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all specifications, and clearly documents that the offered products meet or exceed the specifications stated above.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

Q.1.  Are there specific EPA methods that will be followed?  We need this information to ensure that we include all items necessary for the method (i.e. correct sparge vessel and type of autosampler.) 


A.1.  The EPA methods that the Contractor shall follow are EPA methods 502.1 (Volatile Halogenated Organic Compounds in Water by Purge and Trap Gas Chromatography), 503.1 (Volatile Aromatic and Unsaturated Organic Compounds in Water by Purge and Trap Gas Chromatography), 524.2 rev. 3.0 and rev. 4.0 (Measurement of Purgeable Organic Compounds in Water by Capillary Column Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry).  The Contractor shall also follow the ASTM method D5790 (Measurement of Purgeable Organic Compounds in Water by Capillary Column Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry).  NIST will apply this to some chlorinated and phosphorus containing pesticides, if they are appropriately volatile.
