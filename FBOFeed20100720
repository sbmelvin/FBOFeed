Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for bid opening/receipt of proposals may render your bid or proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of same.  The POC for this effort is Lynn Baker, Contract Specialist, E-mail: lynn.baker1@us.army.mil.  Offers for concerns other than the above are not solicited.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Ground Vehicle Simulation Laboratory (GVSL) is located at the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Commands Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-TARDEC) in Warren, Michigan.  The GVSL is a world-class facility that develops and applies physics-based simulations and simulators in support of TACOMs military vehicle research, development, acquisition and life cycle management missions.  The GVSLs computer-based models are capable of predicting many measures of vehicle dynamic and structural integrity performance.  The GVSLs unique motion-based simulators are used to place users, vehicle subsystems, or full vehicles in a variety of dynamic environments which accurately reproduce motion disturbances experienced during proving ground tests or field operations.<BR><BR>The GVSL is looking to continue enhancing their modeling and simulation technology.  This modeling and simulation technology is intended to build upon the infrastructure currently existing in the GVSL to conduct Warrior/Hardware-in-the-loop simulations.  The technology developed will advance the Armys ability to evaluate vehicle systems with regard to mobility, durability, and operations on the move.  The technologies developed must be able to execute in real-time and must be physics-based.  The GVSL has developed a baseline capability for man/hardware-in-the-loop simulation with existing motion base simulators, image generators, real-time dynamics models, high performance computers, and a software framework which serves as the foundation for these technologies. <BR><BR>The Contractor shall provide, on a work directive basis, the required expertise, software, support, and services to the GVSL in performing the above mission.  The Contractor shall advise the GVSL with regard to technical and programmatic issues.  The Contractor shall provide the required support working as an independent Contractor and not as an employee of the Government.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The DARPA Soldier Protection Systems- Material Systems Concept Development (SPS-MSCD) Program seeks the development and demonstration of technologies that will enable the defeat of the current and envisioned future ballistic (bullets, fragments, and explosively formed projectiles (EFPs)) and blast threats, with performance increases substantially better than Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel and at lower weights. Ultimate application for both mounted (vehicle) and dismounted (body armor) soldier protection systems is envisioned. DARPA is soliciting multidisciplinary research proposals to develop and demonstrate materials and material systems that can be engineered to manipulate the energy of ballistic/blast threats. This may be done either spatially to maximize rate of degradation and/or temporally by capturing/converting early time threat energy so that it can be used to counteract penetration or blast within the timeframe characteristic of the threat.

Furthermore, awarding to another vendor would not be feasible for meeting theGovernments instrumentation schedule requirements and would be cost prohibitive to theGovernment.AERONET is an internationally federated network of sun photometers that has grown from 6instruments in 1993 to approximately 450 instruments today.  It has grown due tostandardization on all aspects of the program.	This includes data processing, datameasurement protocols, calibration procedures and scientific equipment used.  Withrespect to the latter, one fundamental radiometer produced by CIMEL Electronique, theCE318, has been the only instrument used in and designed to the specific requirements ofthe AERONET program.As demonstrated by the shadow band network and satellite remote sensing in general,prompt delivery of the data for analysis is fundamental for obtaining a comprehensive,continuous data base and allows assessment of the collecting instruments' health andcalibration. In order to achieve this goal, minimize costs and expand the coverageglobally, the project uses the simple and inexpensive Data Collection System (DCS)operating on the geosynchronous GOES, METEOSAT and GMS satellites providing nearly globalcoverage in near real-time at minimal expense.With well over 100 sites the sun photometer must be able to consistently transmit dataunder a wide variation of climate conditions.  Because this is a global network, theinstrumentation must be able to withstand harsh weather conditions and still be able totransmit data reliably.  In addition to the requirement to withstand climate, theinstrumentation should be portable and easy to install in the field.  This ease of usegreatly reduces the cost of labor enabling less skilled site managers and employees to beable to set up the equipment to begin data collection.	Because of the remote locationsand the availability of power to the photometers, the instrumentation should have lowpower requirements.  The CIMEL 318 family of sun photometer operates on 5watt solarpanels.  Due to the magnitude of this global network and the almost constant flux ofinstruments being calibrated and shipped out to sites the instrumentation should belight.	The CE318 family meets this requirement by weighing in at less than 20kg,allowing for ease of shipping and reduction of cost for freight.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. EasternStandard Time (EST) on July 30, 2010.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VA Illiana Health Care System, 1900 East Main Street, Danville, IL intends to negotiate with New Hope Apartments to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The contract period is expected to run August 16, 2010 through July 31, 2011 with four 1-year renewal options.  The proposed action is for the HCHV program, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  This procurement is based on the determination that the government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by services available from only one source located in the geographic area of Decatur, IL.  

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about June 25, 2010.

f.	Staff behavior and interaction with residents convey an attitude of genuine concern and caring.

g.    Appetizing, nutritionally adequate meals are provided in a setting that encourages social interaction (wherever possible) and nutritious snacks between meals and bedtime are available for those requiring or desiring additional food, when it is not medically contraindicated.  This is particularly indicated for homeless chronically mentally ill residents.  Many of these residents are either undernourished or have developed poor eating habits or both, because of their chronic psychiatric disorder, including alcohol/drug abuse behaviors.  VA ILLIANA dietitian may consult with the initial inspection team and the team making subsequent assessments, in evaluating not only the printed menus but the resident's satisfaction with meals and the actual consumption of food offered. Adequate dietary requirements for veterans requiring special diets shall be adhered to.

14.  Yearly and random inspections of the residential treatment center shall be made by VA ILLIANA multidisciplinary team.  As VA ILLIANA program personnel accomplish site visits, attention will be directed to the adequacy of veterans' records.  Site visits will also include a spot check of records to ensure contractor invoices accurately reflect the veteran's length of stay.

<RESPDATE>080410
<CONTACT>Carol A. Wood, Phone 301-975-8172, Fax 301-975-6273, Email carol.wood@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on behalf of the Radiation Interactions and Dosimetry Group, with Hopewell Designs, Inc., of Alpharetta, GA, for a new cesium-137 gamma-ray calibration range that will be used to provide standard air kerma measurements. 

The Radiation Dosimetry and Interactions Group maintain and disseminate radiation dose standards throughout the country. As part of this program, NIST currently makes use of a horizontal beam gamma-ray calibration facility that was originally developed in the 1960s.  This facility is used routinely to perform calibration of radiation measuring instruments for a large number of users throughout the country including the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, Department of Energy, and hospitals.

The Group is developing a new facility to provide standard air kerma measurements from cesium-137 gamma ray beams. This will constitute the national standard for air kerma. The standard will be disseminated throughout the country via calibration of high precision radiation measuring instruments such as cavity ionization chambers.  The specifications of the new facility will be such that accurate radiation measurements (at the 0.1% level or better) can be ensured. 

The new facility will extend the range of dose rates that are currently available in the     existing horizontal beam facility.  This new facility together with the existing facility 
will allow NIST to offer a broad range of dose rates.  This will allow NIST to meet the 
demands required by the newest generation of radiation detection instruments and 
calibration facilities throughout the country.   

The Contractor shall deliver and install a cesium-137 gamma-ray beam calibration system.  All of the following shall be delivered/completed:  
	1. Room preparation
	2. Shielding panels
	3. Sliding lead shield door
	4. Interlock and safety systems
	5. Cs-137 irradiator
	6. Irradiator controller
	7. Positioning track system for detector calibrations
	8. Software.
     
The controller for the irradiator has to be compatible with the controller that is currently being 
used in the existing NIST calibration range.  Both controllers must have the same functions and technical specifications.  The implementation of these functions is  performed by using PLC.  
      
The measurements made for the NIST calibration service rely on the use of the controller and 
automation software for acquiring the data.  The controller can collect information from the 
gamma irradiator that is critical to the measurements performed during the calibration 
service.  Without being able to collect this information, the calibration service could not be 
performed. 

It is critical that the automation software is compatible with NISTs existing controller.  The 
automation software is used to operate the calibration system, therefore, must be compatible 
for data analysis.  The remote commands of the controller on the required gamma-ray 
calibration range must include identical commands to those that will be used in the existing 
calibration range.  The automation software will also integrate the controller and the 
cesium-137 irradiator being acquired. 

In 2004, the controller of the existing horizontal beam facility was replaced; only a new controller was installed, not a new system.  The existing controller was built by Hopewell Designs.  The design of the controller and the software are proprietary to Hopewell Designs.  NIST does not have data rights to these designs.  

The gamma-ray calibration range, including the controller and the software are 
commercial items.  Hopewell Designs, Inc. has proprietary rights to the technology which 
 governs the hardware and software.  Hopewell Designs will be responsible for the      
 manufacture, installation, training, and testing of the system to ensure it meets all required 
 performance specifications, including compatibility with the existing system.

Hopewell has no authorized service representatives or distributors.  Therefore, only 
Hopewell can supply the required system and guarantee compatibility.    
      
A potential source would have to possess proprietary knowledge of the Hopewell Designs equipment.  No other vendor possesses the knowledge to provide the required products and services.  No other vendor has rights to Hopewells proprietary hardware and software. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by August 4, 2010, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This synopsis follows a Sources Sought notice that was released on March 9, 2010 under HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-PCPSB-5012-55
<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice in advance of a Request for Proposal (RFP), and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, No. HHSN261201105012-55, detailing the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an offeror's proposal will be available electronically on or about August 15, 2010 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following URL location: (http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/); once there, click on Current Requests for Proposals and will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the National Cancer Institute posting section. No paper copies will be available. Proposals will be due on or about September 19, 2010. It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about April 16, 2011. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed project is to 1) evaluate how ongoing and/or developing inter-organizational relationships of the expanded NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) with other relevant NCI-sponsored research programs and funded organizations can differentially influence site performance across core program components; and 2) selectively analyze how other relevant environmental and organizational covariates (including relationships with community physicians in private practice) may directly influence program performance, or interact with research connections of various types to influence performance. Thereby, the Contractor will examine the relationships that individual NCCCP sites have with other NCI-sponsored programs. Based on these inter-organizational relationships, the evaluation will examine how these relationships contribute to the site's performance, as well as assessing how program performance differs across the NCCCP given the various types and intensities of linkages NCCCP sites have with other NCI programs. The anticipated contract will cover assessments at four levels of the NCCCP: environmental, organizational, physician, and patient care components. The Contractor will design the evaluation to include the assessment of the type, scope, and intensity linkages between NCCCP sites and other NCI-sponsored programs. The Contractor will develop the metrics, study protocols, and analytical approaches and conduct a variety of assessments to examine the inter-organizational linkages, how they are established, how they function, and their influences on NCCCP performance at the individual sites.</p>
<p>Offerors shall demonstrate an understanding of inter-organizational relationships in health care delivery organizations (such as the NCCCP sites have with other relevant research programs) and funded organizations [such as the NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers and NCI's Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOPs] that can have differential influences on program performance. Offerors shall also demonstrate both practical and conceptual knowledge of ways to address how the specific type and forms of NCCCP sites' inter-organizational relationships drive program performance in the following areas: 1) building research capacity through: a. improved bio-specimen collection and reporting, b. early phase clinical trial accrual and physician participation, c. electronic data exchange, and d. use of ca-BIG tools and applications to facilitate personalized medicine and developing new research initiatives; 2) improving adherence to evidence-based practice across the cancer continuum through the use and measurement of clinical guidelines and their applications in NCCCP network quality improvement collaboratives; and 3) developing effective strategies that reduce cancer health disparities. Additionally, offerors shall demonstrate their knowledge and expertise required to analyze how other relevant environmental and organizational covariates (including relationships with community physicians in private practice) may directly influence program performance or interact with research connections of various types to influence performance. It is important to demonstrate knowledge of and experience with relevant approaches to examine these influences at all four levels of assessments: environmental, organizational, physician, and patient.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS OF: PERFORMANCE MEASURE STUDIES, WELL-BEING ANALYSES, COMMUNITY CLUSTER ANALYSES AND SOCIAL INDICATORS STUDY: IMPROVING THE CONDUCT OF SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS (SIAS) IN THE NORTHEAST REGION.
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Performance Measure Studies, Well-being Analyses, Community Cluster Analyses and Social Indicators Study: Improving the Conduct of Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) in the Northeast Region.</p>
<p>NOAA is requesting quotes that can accomplish the following:<br />(a) The core of the in-person survey of well-being, job satisfaction and sector participation of individual and former fishermen and vessel owners for the Mid-Atlantic would remain identical to the current New England version, thus allowing it to be part of the time series that these two baseline efforts will begin. The Mid-Atlantic survey, as the New England one, will be accompanied by carefully associated oral histories to capture the fishing family, household and community aspects of well-being not covered in the survey of individual and former fishermen and vessel owners.</p>
<p>In addition, because this will be a streamlined version of the New England survey (which already asks some management and sector-specific questions), it will be possible to add some additional questions relative to key fishery performance measures as viewed by industry members - while still keeping the survey to approximately 30 minutes. This section of the survey would parallel an industry outreach effort on fishery performance measures that was completed in New England in April 2010 by the Gulf of Maine Research institute (GMRI) under a CINAR grant.</p>
<p>(b) An updated run will be conducted of the original overall cluster analysis of all Northeast Region communities in the latest version of the SSD. Following on from this separate runs will be conducted on sub-sets of communities that are associated with each of the current Northeast Region FMPs.</p>
<p>(c) A standardized set of social indicators to measure resilience/vulnerability, sustainability and other indicators (e.g., gentrification) in the Northeast will be developed that is complementary to such a dataset for the Southeast, and actual indicators will be created and analyzed. As part of this process, a data management protocol will be developed in conjunction with NEFSC and NMFS Southeast Region personnel, to allow data portability and comparisons across regions.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. The solicitation and proposed fixed price contract will be issued utilizing FAR Part 12 and the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis using the following factors listed in descending order of importance, (1) Experience; (2) Past performance; (3) Price. When combined, experience and past performance are significantly more important than price. All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency. To be eligible for award, vendors must obtain a DUNS number (this may be done by calling 1-800-333-0505) and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR): www.ccr.gov. Prospective contractors are also required to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required CCR registration. The solicitation will be available electronically on or about July 20, 2010 via FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov. Amendments to the solicitation will also be provided on the Internet using the same protocol listed above. Telephone requests for hard copies will not be honored. Hard copies of the solicitation may also be provided in response to a written or faxed request received directly from the contractor. Requests for hard copies of the solicitation may also be faxed to (757) 664-3636. Quotes will be accepted electronically at the following email address: Brian.O'Boyle@noaa.gov and via facsimile at (757) 664-3636.</p>

<CONTACT>William M Roberson, Phone 202-418-5367, Fax 202-418-5414, Email wroberson@cftc.gov
<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") intends to award a sole source modification for additional contractor support during Option Year I of contract CFOM-09-CO-0177 with Fox RPM Corporation. Through this contract, CFTC accesses a computer-aided facility management (CAFM) system, FoxFMS, which is hosted by the contractor. The base period of the contract, which expires on September 23, 2010, required the contractor to implement the system, and also includes system access, maintenance and technical support. Furthermore, the base year includes 805 direct labor hours, where the contractor uses the system in furnishing direct support of the Commission's current space expansion project and additional space management activities. The option years of the contract presently include only system access, maintenance and technical support of the system. CFTC's space expansion project is continuing. As such, the Commission has determined that it requires additional ongoing direct support into Option Year I. CFTC intends to modify the contract to incorporate 840 hours of direct labor into Option Year I, to continue the contractor's support of CFTC's space expansion project and to perform additional space management activities within the system. CFTC anticipates that by the conclusion of Option Year I (September 23, 2011), it will not need dedicated support, and that future work within the CAFM system will be performed solely by CFTC personnel. Due to the contractor's ongoing involvement in the Commission's space expansion project, and since the FoxFMS system is proprietary to Fox RPM Corporation, the Commission considers Fox RPM to be uniquely qualified to continue providing the required support services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by 3:00 p.m. local (Washington, DC) time on August 4, 2010. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source modification described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for a technology concept designed to develop skin-to-skin mooring capabilities for the Navy. For simplicity, this technology need is referred to as the Advanced Mooring System or AMS. This product was selected because the Seabasing Joint Integrating Concept defines a need to quickly and safely moor lightweight hull connectors and high-flare container ships to the Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) in high sea states, and no system exists to do this today.
<p>The AMS will improve vehicle, personnel, and container transfer during skin-to-skin mooring within the sea base through Sea State 3 (threshold), Sea State 4 (objective).</p>
<p>It is anticipated that award(s) will be in the form of cost-type contract(s), specifically Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with cost-type Task Order(s) made off of those IDIQs.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD 
Statement of Work Request
2/11/2010

The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) web site http://www.ptsd.va.gov is a resource for anyone investigating PTSD, whether for professional or personal reasons.  Fact sheets, clinical resources, and research links provide information to clinicians as well as the general public.  The Center is now looking to expand its use of video on the web.  In our increasingly visual culture, documentary testimonials facilitate the communication of important information. Video can add an emotional quality often lacking in text.  It will bring a human element to the material that will help connect the viewer to the content.  

Project:  To produce three high definition video profiles for the National Center's website www.ptsd.va.gov.  
   
DESCRIPTION: We are looking for an experienced, skilled photo journalist/filmmaker and a production company that will work with our in house producer/director (PD) to create three PTSD centered multi-layered profiles. The goal is to use a combination of still photography, audio, video, music, graphics, text, and stock footage to create informative and visually evocative segments to post on our website.  These photographic/video profiles will be used to explain to Veterans and the public, fundamental information about PTSD, including how to recognize the symptoms of PTSD, and what PTSD treatments are available.  Each profile will be uploaded onto our website in at least three segments:  A main segment (5 - 7 minutes), and three supporting segments (2 - 3 minutes each).  The main segment will focus on the individual with PTSD and the supporting segments may also include family members, friends, and/or clinicians, all to be determined in the research phase of the production.  The total amount of edited video for each complete profile will be approximately 12 to 17 minutes.

WORK REQUIREMENTS: 

The National Center for PTSD has an in-house producer director (PD) that will oversee and approve all aspects of production.  The PD will also identify subjects and associated interviewees, serve as the point of contact for scheduling interviews, and potentially conduct the interviews.  

The contractor will work closely with the PD throughout the preparation for the shoots.  The contractor will identify and provide all crew (photo journalist/filmmaker, sound, lights, production help, and the editor) and equipment (camera, lighting, audio, editing equipment, etc.) necessary to complete the production of videos.  The contractor will also be responsible for studio space, (if necessary), lodging, and travel for crew and organizing all production needs in the field.  Key personnel and equipment will be approved by the PD prior to filming.  Shooting will be in HD format using a stills camera on par with or of similar quality to a Cannon D7, and for video where the D7 is not appropriate a video camera on par with a SonyEX3 complete with adaptors for wide angle and other cinematic lenses.  A selection of radio microphones and a lighting kit to be determined by the PD and the photojournalist/filmmaker will also be supplied by the contractor.  At the completion of each shoot, copies of all footage shot plus transcripts of interviews will be delivered to the National Center ready for unwrapping or uploading into Final Cut Studio.  Still pictures will be digitally captured, color corrected, and sent to the Center for viewing. 

In the post production phase, the contractor will hire an editor who is an expert with Final Cut Studio which will be used as the editing program.  The PD will approve the editor and will provide the editor with selects and work closely with the editor through to completion. The PD will have final approval on all the independent elements that are used in the film, including music (up to one original theme per profile), graphics, and sound effects.   Once the final cut is approved, the contractor under the supervision of the PD will be responsible for all required finishing of the product, including but not exclusive to a sound edit and mix and color correct.    

Interviews will be shot on locations within the continental United States.  It is our hope to consolidate the interview locations, but the subjects have yet to be identified. Travel will be reimbursed to the successful contractor at the government per-diem rate.

NOTE:  We have considered a variety of methods to produce these videos including moving picture, a combination of stills and video, using a second camera during interviews, exploring "quiet" as a story telling technique, etc.  We have also considered shooting the profiles in two phases: the first is a research / pre-interview phase for stills photography with some video. This would focus on the main character.  This would be followed by a second, separate phase for more photography, both still and video, as well as interviews and footage with supporting characters such as treating clinicians.  We would also consider the contractor proposals for filming these profiles that will make the end product artistic, accessible and believable. For a guide to the kind of work we are looking for please visit the following sites:  http://www.mediastorms.org or http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/1-in-8-million/index.html

Proposed Timeline:	Month 1	Month 2	Month 3	Months 4-6	Months 7-12
Meeting between PD and contractor to discuss production plans, schedule and technical requirements 	x				
Contractor submits 
production schedule	x				
 PD reviews proposal and, if necessary, requests modifications.	x

Contractor preps for and organizes field production		x	x		
Contractor and PD shoot interviews and b-roll on location			x	x	
Post Production edits, music, finished products including 508 compliance				x	x


Deliverables:
The contractor will use the video footage, still photographs, and other materials to produce a series of three profiles for the website.  These profiles will be made up of 3 components:
1)	A short clip (less than 1 minute) to attract the viewer into the larger story.  This may be audio/stills, audio/video or a combination to be determined by PD.
2)	The primary segment (approximately 7 minutes) featuring an individual with PTSD, will feature stills, video, audio, interview, and b-roll.  This may also include music, text, graphics and/or narration.
3)	Supporting segments (approximately 2-3 minutes each).





Profile =






All digital footage and photographs will be the property of the National Center for PTSD.


Option Year 2
To renew contract to produce three additional profiles.  

Option Year 3
To renew contract to produce three additional profiles.

<DESC>Request for Information
USPS Air Transportation CMC
Washington, DC

In accordance with the Postal Services Supplying Principles and Practices 2008, USPS is issuing a request for information (RFI) as a sources sought notice.  

A.  The Postal Service does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to pay for the information solicited. 

B.  This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying suppliers who can provide immediate reaction air transportation services for the transport of bio-hazardous material and accompanying passengers between Miami, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico (MIA-SJU-MIA).

This is an invitation for potential suppliers to register interest in providing air transportation and supporting services.  Potential suppliers are asked to submit responses that provide information about their companies to meet or exceed our provided requirements.  This process identifies what is in the marketplace and provides an opportunity to pre-qualify potential suppliers.  Unlike a request for proposal (RFP), an RFI provides the Postal Service with useful information to further assess whether it is feasible and may lead to innovative solutions and a better understanding of how the requirements can be met.  The most suitable potential suppliers at this stage are logical sources to fill the requirements in the future should the need arise.

1.01 Overview

The purpose of this ordering agreement is to enable the United States Postal Service to procure immediate reaction air transportation services for the transport of bio-hazardous material and accompanying passengers from and to designated airports in a fully dedicated jet aircraft with the capability to transport passengers with cargo exactly as specified throughout this information between Miami, Florida, and San Juan, Puerto Rico (MIA-SJU-MIA).

This agreement will become a Firm Fixed Price contract upon acceptance of an order by the supplier (in writing) to provide service as ordered by the Postal Service and agreement on price (all-inclusive rate).  

1.02 Series of Events

In the event of a bio-hazardous incident, the following series of events will occur:

*Biohazard Detection System (BDS) indicates an alert
*Air transportation supplier is notified.  Supplier has two hours from time of initial contact to be fully crewed, fueled and flight-ready.
*U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) responds to facility and collects BDS samples as evidence.
*Two accompanying USPIS Inspectors will arrive at suppliers aircraft with evidence container and carry-on luggage.
*Aircraft will depart immediately after boarding of evidence container and accompanying Inspectors.  Pilots are encouraged to safely fly at the fastest possible speed in order to arrive at destination in the shortest period of travel time.
*Upon arrival, inspectors will transfer evidence container to Laboratory Response Network (LRN) representatives
*If aircraft is based at point of origin departure, pilots will wait for two accompanying Inspectors for return flight.  If aircraft is based other than point of origin, upon arrival and completion of mission, aircraft is cleared to reposition unless return trip is requested by Postal Service.

1.03 Scope of Service

The Postal Service will retain a list of potential charter passenger jet aircraft providers.  Each supplier must keep the Postal Service updated on critical information such as aircraft type availability, location of aircraft (base), 24-hour telephone contact number, and other appropriate operational information.

Initial Supplier Contact

When a need is determined, the Postal Service (USPIS Inspector or designated postal employee) will place an order for service via telephone.  If for some reason contact with a representative of the supplier is not made (communication with an individual versus voicemail), the Postal Service will contact the next supplier on the list and provide notice of potential use.  After fifteen minutes from initial contact telephone call, Inspectors will contact original supplier for second chance.  If no individual answers, Postal Service will proceed to contract with the next available supplier on the list.

Upon confirmation of order by both parties, supplier will immediately begin to crew aircraft, prepare aircraft for flight and notify necessary agencies and request priority departure from airport authority.  The supplier must make every attempt to meet the projected time for aircraft preparation (crew, fueling, etc.).  If a significant delay occurs in aircraft preparation, the contract may be terminated for default and the Postal Service may obtain transportation from an alternative supplier.

Supplier will provide the following information to the Postal Service:

*Physical location of aircraft
*Directions to aircraft
*Aircraft tail number
*Estimated time aircraft will be available for departure
*Flight number
*Names of Pilot, Co-Pilot and other crewmembers
*Additional information as appropriate

Once an order is placed and accepted, the aircraft type, tail number, flight crew, and flight schedule accepted by the Postal Service will become the contractual agreement.

The supplier will provide the required size, quantity, and condition of passenger jet aircraft necessary to perform the services described within the Statement of Work in the most expeditious manner.  The aircraft will operate as dedicated aircraft during the agreed upon hours of operation.  The supplier may be required to submit aircraft status reports to the Postal Service.

The priority of this agreement is the mandate to expeditiously transport Postal passengers and evidence container safely to final destination.  Both parties agree to cooperate and collaborate to provide necessary information and documentation to the necessary agencies in order to receive priority departure, flight and landing status.  Both parties further agree to process necessary documentation to meet the provisions of this agreement as soon as possible after completion of flight mission.

Aircraft

Lift Capabilities.  Aircraft provided by the supplier must have sufficient capacity to safely transport, at a minimum, two passengers, luggage, and evidence container in most expeditious manner.  The supplier must provide jet aircraft that meets or exceeds the requirements.

By submitting an offer, the offeror agrees that the US Postal Service will have access to the entire capacity of the aircraft.  Absolutely, no unauthorized passengers, baggage, cargo, freight or other product may be transported on this flight.

Aircraft Maintenance

The supplier is responsible for the maintenance of contracted aircraft in compliance with the Federal Aviation Regulations as applicable to the type of certificate for the aircraft provided, (for example, Part 121, subpart L) as applicable, and all other applicable U.S. Government regulations.  The supplier is completely and exclusively responsible for the safety and maintenance (and all applicable costs) of all aircraft.

Aviation Fuel

The supplier will be responsible for obtaining and uploading all aviation fuel necessary to operate the aircraft.  The supplier will be responsible for any and all costs associated with aviation fuel and its upload into the aircraft.  The Postal Service will not reimburse the supplier for any fuel costs as a pass through reimbursement (see all-inclusive rates).  The Postal Service will not assume responsibility for, or reimburse the supplier for, the purchase of fuel necessary to position or deposition the aircraft as a pass through expense.

De-icing

The aviation supplier is responsible for obtaining de-icing fluid and application services of aircraft, if necessary.

Flight Crews

The supplier must provide fully trained and qualified flight crews certified under FAR 121 or 135 regulations to operate all flights.  Flight crew must be properly trained in accordance with DOT and other federal agencies regulations applicable to transporting hazardous materials, including Division 6.2, infectious substances.  The supplier must ensure that the necessary clearances and background checks have been performed on each pilot, co-pilot and crewmember.  Upon request, the supplier should be prepared to provide background and security clearance information to the USPIS concerning any employee involved in the operations of the flight.

Landing Slots and Parking Fees

The supplier will acquire and pay for all necessary landing and parking at each air stop.

Alternate Landing Sites

If the supplier is ordered to land at an alternate airport, the supplier will immediately contact the Inspection Service or the official designated contact person and provide necessary information.

<DESC>55 CONS/LGCZ, Offutt AFB, NE intends to award a two month sole source extension to Northrop Grumman Space &amp; Mission Systems under authority of 40 U.S.C. 121(c), FAR 8.405-6 and DFARS 208.405-70. The specific circumstance that justifies restriction for this acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(b)(2). The continued work is a logical follow-on to the original Federal Supply Schedule order and was competed and awarded in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not issued under sole source or limited source procedures. The contractor shall continue to provide Nuclear Weapons Effects Scientific Analysis and Reporting Support for USSTRATCOM / J3. The primary objective of this task order is the continued analysis and support of areas pertaining to survivability over a broad range of mission areas and systems at Offutt Air Force Base, NE. This task order provides Advisory and Assistance (A&amp;AS) support for scientific and technical analysis and support in order to properly characterize nuclear weapon effects and determine the potential impact these effects will have on USSTRATCOM mission areas. A Top Secret clearance with eligibility for Special Compartment Information (SCI) and Nuclear Command and Control/Extremely Sensitive Information (NC2/ESI) is required for contractor personnel.
<p>The current effort is undergoing a contractor to civilian conversion. However, the conversion process is not expected to be completed by 31 Jul 10, the end date of the current period of performance. Therefore, the Government intends to extend the current task order for two months (1 Aug 10 through 30 Sep 10) to allow time for completion of the contractor to civilian conversion process.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement is based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>If your company has the capability to provide Nuclear Weapons Effects Scientific Analysis and Reporting Support services at full performance starting 1 Aug 10 through 30 Sep 10, provide a capability package to the Contracting Officer and a copy to the Contract Specialist by the response date, 23 Jul 10.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture - Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) anticipates a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for the following requirement: Four Post Deer Treatment Station (Dandux Outdoors).</p>
<p>The USDA-APHIS-VS Texas office is currently fighting an outbreak of Texas Fever Ticks. This pest is highly fatal to cattle. White tail (and other) deer contribute significantly to the spread of this disease. USDA ARS (Agricultural Resource Service) developed and patented a tickicide applicator for deer. Currently CR Daniels (Dandux) is the only commercial licensed manufacturer of this treatment station. Since USDA developed the product the patent is available for other contractors to use to manufacture this item solely for use by the Federal Government. If a company is interested in manufacturing this product please contact the contracting officer (information below). A copy of the patent is attached as a reference.</p>
<p>Dandux outdoors has an exclusive commercial patent license to manufacture a four post deer feeder adapter which applies tickicide with Agricultural Resources Services.

No objections were received. The patent will expire August 10, 2013</p>
<p>This station has been modified to be a 2 post treatment station. ARS patent lawyers have found that this modification falls under the four post patent and license agreement.</p>
<p>The current order is for 300 deer feeder adapters.</p>
<p>Interested sources that are capable of providing the equivalent supply listed above are encouraged to submit statements of capability to the contracting office.

<DESC>1. Sole Source Justification
<p>2. Authority FAR 6.302-1</p>
<p><br />3. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Center for Plant Health Science and Technology (CPHST) Buzzards Bay, MA intends to award a sole source contract to Varian Inc. 2700 Mitchell Drive, Walnut Creek, CA 94598, Agilent/Varian 490 Micro GC. Varian is the only source known to supply this item, and factory modify it to meet the program requirements as follows.</p>
<p>4. The 490 has a unique Auto Ranging capability where a single injection of gas with very large and very small amounts of gasses can be accurately measured. This is an important feature for us as it will allow us to use the 490 to monitor fumigations with multiple gases. (e.g. SO2 and CO2)</p>
<p>5. The 490 has a superior injector design reduces internal dead volume and improving reproducibility, making the unit easier to use.</p>
<p>6. The 490 offers the ability to vary the sample volume so we can adjust the amount of gas introduced onto the system to optimize the response. This is particularly important in fumigation monitoring as it allows us to take very small samples from small scale fumigation chambers where we don't want to reduce the concentration, while still having the convenience of being able to plumb the GC into larger chambers.</p>
<p>7. The 490 has user removable modules for quick and easy reconfiguration and repair with exchangeable GC channels! Flexibility. Modules have a unique Electronic Data Sheets EDS which allow for immediate start up and storage of operational history and last used methods</p>
<p>8. The 490 can be configured as a standalone benchtop unit or it can be easily transported in a field case, this feature also suits are needs as we can set it up temporally in our quantine facility for small scale fumigations, and also use it for off site work with quarantine fumigations in our parts of the US</p>
<p>9. Service is arranged on site, we don't have to package the package the unit and ship it in for lengthy depot repair. We have 5 other Agilent GCs on site in the lab, we have had good experience with the service technicians.</p>
<p>10. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Simplified procurement procedures will be used as well as commercial item acquisition regulations per FAR12. Number note 22 applies. Any inquires for this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Leigh Eberhart at Leigh.D.Eberhart@aphis.usda.gov The NACIS Code for this acquisition is 423490 with a size standard of 100 people.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, has a requirement for the Winthrop National Fish Hatchery, Adult Holding and Spawning Facilities, Leavenworth Fisheries Complex, Washington.  The Winthrop National Fish Hatchery is located approximately 90 miles north of Wenatchee (Okanogan County) Washington.  The initial pre-solicitation notice was issued on April 28, 2010 at www.fbo.gov.
This requirement was originally funded via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).  This requirement has been removed from ARRA funding and will now be funded via fiscal year 2011 appropriations.
The principal components of the work remain the same and the requirement remains set-aside as an 8(a) competitive negotiated procurement (see the original notice).  An electronic copy of the solicitation will be available APPROXIMATELY July 20, 2010, at www.fbo.gov.  Prospective offerors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving award of any contract - see www.ccr.gov.
This requirement was issued in error on July 2, 2010, and amendment 001 was issued later that same day to retract the solicitation package.  Due to these postings the actual solicitation package will be issued via amendment 002 using the same solicitation number.

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado, intends to award a Brand Name Only Purchase Order on a Sole Source basis to Education Systems, Inc. to provide EMAS Recruitment Pro Software, 1 Year Maintenance, Installation, Integration and Training. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42, 16 July 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 541511 and the size standard is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>USAFA/RR is replacing a custom-built application with a COTS solution. USAFA must take into account medical readiness, physical fitness, recruiting/interviewing with 1,700 fielded USAF Admissions Liaison Officers (ALOs), and the competitive nature of the Senatorial/Congressional/Presidential nomination process. In order to facilitate these differences, and to allow seamless integration into the USAFA/RR online application systems, the COTS product selected must be capable of running on the same platform as the online systems already in place, it must utilize the same database backend as the existing online systems, and it must allow direct manipulation of the data tables themselves (i.e. it must be an open system). This last requirement is paramount for both integration with existing online systems and for implementation of the customer requirements discussed previously. EMAS Recruitment Pro is the only package on the market with an open architecture, including a published data dictionary. EMAS Recruitment Pro (Recruiting and Enrollment Software) is only available directly from the vendor, Education Systems, Inc.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to the 10th Communications Squadron at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the EMAS Recruitment Pro Software and related Services or can provide the brand name product may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can either provide an equal product or they are an authorized distributor/wholesaler for EMAS Recruitment Pro Software. It is the offeror's responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Contracting and General Services, Portland, Oregon intends to award a sole source fixed price purchase order to Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Completion procedures.
This acquisition is to support a one-time purchase of a DNA extractor for the monitoring of fish parasites at the USFWS California Fish Health Center.  Monitoring of fish parasites requires DNA testing of tissues, and efficient DNA extraction is critical to this effort because of the large sample numbers processed, thus the need of a DNA extractor that is efficient and has high throughput.  
After preliminary market research and comparison with similar equipment, the ABI instrument has shown to  extract DNA in a sufficient manner and the cost per sample is comparable to the cost of the machine currently in use.  The equipment is considerably more affordable compared to other equipment that was reviewed.
Specific characteristics of materials and equipment limits the availability and patented property rights only to Applied Biosystems. The unique features and function of the equipment will best meet the requirements needed at the fish health center.  The vendor provides warranty work and servicing  and has demonstrated the ability to provide these services. 
This is not a request for quotes and no written solicitation will be issued. Nevertheless, any firm that is capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a response not later than close of business on 7/30/10.  Response to this posting must be submitted in writing via email.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Linda Askew at linda_askew@fws.gov

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER THE IDIQ CONTRACT NUMBER AG-3A75-C-0023.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing a project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposal for A&E Services under the IDIQ Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0023.  A Task Order will be issued to Black & Veatch Special Project for independent design review of an ARRA Watershed Rehabilitation project in the state of Kentucky: Fox Creek Site 4.  The NAICS code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design Review with detail cost proposal from Black & Veatch Special Project is due no later than close of business on July 23, 2010.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein: 

 I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories, operated by Sandia Corporation under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, is seeking industrial partners to develop applications for a novel approach to suppressing single event transients in CMOS circuits using composite transistors.  Transient-Immune Composite transistors are compatible with standard processing of SOI technology and standard triple-well processing of Bulk CMOS technology.  Sandia has unique technical capabilities and intellectual property in this important technology space (see U.S. 7,298,010).
<p>Single event transients in CMOS circuits are caused by energetic particle radiation resulting in system soft errors.  With the confluence of ever increasing transistor density of integrated circuits and threatening application environments, reliability has become a major concern in the evolution of the next generation systems.  Technology trends such as transistor down-sizing, use of new materials, and system-on-a-chip architectures further increase system sensitivity to single event transients.  Even for terrestrial applications, system errors caused by cosmic radiation become a concern.  Sandia's Transient-Immune Composite transistor technology can help mitigate these soft errors.</p>
<p>Partners will collaborate with Sandia on the continued development of the technology in various applications with the intent of providing a clear path to commercialization.  Qualified partners should be prepared to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with Sandia, contribute resources, including staff and facilities; and, if successful with commercialization, license Sandia's intellectual property.</p>
<p>Companies interested in partnering with Sandia should provide a written statement of interest, including: 1. Company name and address; 2. Name, address, and telephone number of a technical and business points of contact; 3. Description of company business interest, expertise and facilities relevant to this commercialization partnership.<br />For more business and licensing information, please contact Mark Allen, telephone (505) 844-7197, fax (505) 844-8011, email: msallen@sandia.gov.<br />Please respond by email or fax no later than August 31, 2010, at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0114, P.O.

USAID plans to increase the Total Estimated Cost<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>by $10 million. </span>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared. The period of performance remains 60 months from May 14, 2008.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The contract supports the work of EGAT/PR/MD and to a number of other USAID units through buy-ins that support some critical Agency priorities. Activities capture and share knowledge, promote learning, and refine knowledge generation. Methods include document repositories and interactive forums hosted on the microLINKS and PovertyFrontiers websites, among others; blended/continuous learning for new hires and technical backstops in private enterprise and agriculture; communications products and engagement strategies; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN">Activities supported through the core program continue to become more complex as new social media and other technologies develop, and new ways of using them are found; and with a higher-than-expected utilization of the grant mechanism by the core program and the learning networks associated with those grants. The Knowledge-Driven International Development (KDID) web platform will soon launch but will take significant time and resources to mature in terms of content, use, and integration across activities. And the blended learning approach, which reflects and operationalizes the principles incorporated into the Corporate Training Strategy (commissioned by USAID/M/OHR), and thus will prove an important model throughout USAID, will also take time to mature.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN">The web portal is in the late stages of development, with some sites in beta testing phase and others due to enter that phase in the coming year. Following the beta launch, each site will entail implementation of a stakeholder engagement strategy to train users in new features and capabilities. The blended learning for economic growth is in development, with the first phase of rollout for some courses, and with a second phase across at least six courses scheduled for the remaining contract period. Consultation is underway for EGAT/AG training, and a curriculum is being developed. Implementation guidance for the Feed the Future initiative is in the early stages of development. A community of practice is in formation in Jamaica, with actual stakeholder engagement just beginning.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The services required to continue the work initiated through the KDMD contract to a point of stability and maturity are highly specialized. USAID believes that adhering to the initial contract ceiling would seriously impair the work currently underway. Ending the contract early and competing a follow-on contract at this time would result in unacceptable delays and interruptions to work that supports critical Agency priorities.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 12pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">A full and open competition for a follow-on contract to begin at the end of the KDMD contract period is anticipated. </span></p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>The combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a sole source request for quotation under solicitation number W58RGZ-10-Q-0201.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-42 effective 16 June 2010.  This procurement is being conducted pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 for Other Than Full and Open Competition to Druck, Inc., 10311 Westpark Drive, Houston, TX 70742.  The associated North American Industrial Classifications System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513 with a small business standard size of 500 employees.<BR><BR>The Pitot Static Test Set (PSTS) is an aircraft Air Data Systems Tester that is lightweight and man-portable.  It provides capability to troubleshoot, repair, and verify proper operation of flight critical data systems.  The Modification Kit will provide technology modernization to the Armys approximately 500 PSTS.  Each kit is composed of the following items:<BR>1)	Water trap and plastic input pressure regulator<BR>2)	Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 488 card<BR>3)	Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only memory (EEPROM)<BR><BR>This acquisition is for a firm-fixed-price contract to have one (1) contract line item number (0001) for PSTS Modification Kit, including the associated configuration management and provisioning data.  The quantity of CLIN 0001 shall be 500 each.<BR><BR>The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 entitled Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The proposed acquisition requires the use of the authority cited based on the following:  Druck, Inc. is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the PSTS currently in the Army inventory and holds the proprietary rights to all data necessary to produce the required modification kit.  Druck, Inc. has tailored specific software and hardware that meet the physical form and fit necessary to interface with currently fielded PSTS.  At their own expense, Druck, Inc. has already identified and incorporated these technology advances by developing the components outlined in this document.  Opening this requirement to competition would delay upgrading critical equipment up to approximately 30 months.  A competitive requirement would require the development of a technical data package which would also increase the cost.  The additional time, money, and testing required by another manufacturer to duplicate the form, fit, and function necessary to interface these components does not meet the required schedule of fifty (50) per month beginning 90 days after contract award.  Based on current Army aviation fleet, the PSTS, in its modified configuration, is anticipated to meet all required air data test requirements across all Army aviation platforms<BR><BR>Based on the above rationale, the determination has been made that there are no other sources capable of providing the equipment referenced above. <BR><BR>The contractor shall commence delivery of the first unit NLT 90 days after contract award and deliver at a rate of 50 each per month, or best effort, until shipped complete.  Inspection and acceptance shall be Origin.  FOB Point shall be Destination.  Delivery of the 500 each shall be to the following delivery location:<BR><BR>USA DEP LETTERKENNY TRANSPORTATION OFFICE<BR>ATTN: Ed Whitt, (DODAAC: W90CGJ)<BR>1 OVERCASH AVE, BLDG 320<BR>CHAMBERSBURG, PA 17201-4153<BR>MARK FOR: PM AGSE 11C Account<BR><BR>Provisions and clauses applicable to this acquisition are as follows: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders  Commercial Items (applicable clauses are: 52.233-3, 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, and 52.232-33), DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions  Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, DFARS 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, 52.209-6 Protecting the Government interest when subcontracting with contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment,  52.219-16 Liquidated damages- Subcontracting Plan, and 252.219-7004 Small business Subcontracting Plan (Test Program).<BR><BR>The offerors quote must be signed, dated, delivered, submitted electronically, or mailed to the following office no later than 4:30 p.m. (Central) 27  July 2010: U.S. Army Contracting Command Aviation and Missile Command, Contracting Center, ATTN: CCAM-AR-C, Sarah Chatman, Contract Specialist, Building 5309, Room 9237, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898, Fax number: 256-876-3297, or Email address: sarah.chatman@peoavn.army.mil.

A dummy pack(s) shall be assembled and packed by the contractor to represent the total weight of a fully loaded tri-wall container. The dummy pack(s) shall be utilized as the top test unit for all Vehicle Vibration testing involving Tri-wall containers.   The government will supply contractor with empty Tri-wall containers to pack simulated weight containers.<BR><BR><BR>5.1 Temperature Conditioning:  The testing shall be conducted at standard laboratory conditions.  Condition the samples for testing to a standard atmosphere of 73.4  2F (23  1C) and 50  2% relative humidity.  Condition fiberboard containers in accordance with Practice D4332.  The same atmospheric condition should be used for any assurance level.  A conditioning period of 72 hours, or sufficient time to reach equilibrium of all parts of the package and the product is recommended.  Tests should be conducted in the conditioned atmosphere whenever possible.<BR><BR>5.2 Rotational Edge Drops  For edge drops, use Method A of Test Methods D6179 with a 6 in. (150mm) height timber edge support.  Drops shall be made on each opposite edge of the units base, for a total of four impacts.  For all rotational drops, test with the lowest drop height indicated by either gross weight or maximum dimension, using the test levels shown in Table 1.<BR><BR>5.3 Rotational Corner Drops - For corner drops, use Method B of Test Methods D6179, except that one corner of the shipping unit base shall be supported on a 6 in. (150mm) height block while the other corner on the same end or side rests on a 12 in. (300mm) height block.  Each corner will be impacted, for a total of four drops.  For all rotational drops, test with the lowest drop height indicated by either gross weight or maximum dimension, using the test levels shown in Table 1.<BR><BR>Gross Weight, lb (kg) or Maximum Dimension, in (mm)	Drop Height, in.

The test levels and the test methods for this section of the test protocol are intended to determine the ability of the shipping unit to withstand the compressive loads that occur during warehouse storage.  The minimum required load shall be calculated using an F factor of 4.5* in the formula below.  Remove the load within 3 seconds after reaching the specified value.<BR><BR>NOTE:  Since full pallet loads are being tested, F factors may be reduced by 30%.<BR><BR>5.5 Loose Load Vibration  The test levels and the test method for this schedule of the distribution cycle are intended to determine the ability of the shipping unit to withstand the repetitive shocks occurring during transportation of bulk or loose loads.  The test levels and test method account for amplitude, direction, and duration of repetitive shocks.  Test method and test levels shall be in accordance with ASTM D999, Method A1 or A2.<BR><BR>Special Instruction  For Assurance Levels I and II, the dwell time shall be 2 hours on the base for unitized loads and shipping containers with skid bases.  Also, all units to be tested shall not be in a stacked configuration for this section of the test.<BR><BR>5.6 Vehicle Vibration  The test method and levels for this schedule are intended to determine the ability of shipping units to withstand random vibration during transport.  For this section of the test plan, each pallet load shall be fitted with another pallet in a double-stack configuration (if double-stack shipping is applicable for the packaging configuration).  The top pallet should be loaded with a concentrated dead weight load equal to the weight of the lower pallet.  This will simulate a double stack of units in transport, which is valid for certain package configurations listed herein.  Conduct the random vibration test on the shipping units using the PSD (power spectral densities) in Table 2.  For vertical vibration, conduct the test for 3 hours on a vertical motion vibration machine.  If transverse and longitudinal vibrations are possible causes for damage, conduct vibration testing on a horizontal motion vibration machine for 3 hours in each axis.<BR><BR>Vertical	Transverse	Longitudinal<BR>Frequency (Hz)	PSD  ( )<BR>Frequency (Hz)	PSD  ( )<BR>Frequency (Hz)	PSD  ( )<BR><BR>10	0.01500	10	0.00013	10	0.00650<BR>40	0.01500	20	0.00065	20	0.00650<BR>500	0.00015	30	0.00065	120	0.00020<BR>	78	0.00002	121	0.00300<BR>	79	0.00019	200	0.00300<BR>	120	0.00019	240	0.00150<BR>	500	0.00001	340	0.00003<BR>		500	0.00015<BR><BR>Table 2:  Vehicle Vibration PSD<BR><BR><BR><BR>6.0 TEST REPORT:<BR><BR>A final test report shall be submitted to the government upon completion of the test report per attached CDRL A001.

<DESC>The FHFA is seeking an experienced and qualified contractor capable of providing and administering vision care benefits for active employees and their eligible dependents. Currently, the FHFA contracts with United Healthcare to administer its Vision Care Program (the program). The program is fully funded by the FHFA.<br /><br />SEE ATTACHED SOLICITATION FOR ADDITONAL DETAILS<br /><br />The contractor shall provide the services specified in Section C, Performance Work Statement of this solicitation for a fourteen-month base period, three twelve-month option years and the final option period will be for a ten-month period. The period of performance for the base year is October 1, 2010 - December 31, 2011.
<p>Transition Period <br />This contract includes a transition period that will start upon contract award and end on September 30, 2010. The effective date of insurance shall commence on October 1, 2010, which starts the base period of contract performance. The transition period shall include but is not limited to submission of census data, finalizing file layout(s) and data transfer procedures, and a kick-off meeting that will be held within one week of contract award. The transition period shall not be separately priced.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />FHFA will be offering a Vision Care Program to its employees and their eligible dependents. The program shall be a full service vision care program designed to address the treatment and maintenance of vision health related issues. The program shall consist of a single benefit option that provides both in and out-of-network benefits. The program shall include plan development, communication plan, claims processing, and reporting. The cost of Vision Plan premiums for employees and eligible dependents will be fully paid by FHFA. The Vision Plan will only be available to active employees and will not be available to retirees or individuals who leave FHFA.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFEROR<br />Proposals must be received by 10:00 am (EST) on August 23, 2010. The complete quote must be emailed to the address below and three (3) copies mailed or delivered to the following:<br />Federal Housing Finance Agency<br />1700 G Street NW., 3rd Floor<br />ATTN: Katrina D. Jones, Contracting Officer<br />RFP# FHF-10-R-0011 FHFA GROUP VISION CARE PROGRAM<br />Washington, DC 20552</p>
<p>Questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed via email not later than 10:00 am (EST) on AUGUST 5, 2010: via email Katrina.jones@fhfa.gov or via fax: (202) 343-1550 subject line must state: FHFA GROUP VISION CARE PROGRAM. Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable. The Government will not reimburse for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award zero or one contract as a result of this RFP to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value. The award of a contract will be made to the offeror whose proposal conforms to the RFP and is evaluated as being the best value to FHFA (price and other factors considered). A best value award decision will be made using a tradeoff process that considers the evaluation factors: Technical Approach, Past Performance, Experience, Key Personnel and Price. A best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows FHFA to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. The non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the degree of importance of price will increase if the proposals are relatively equal with regard to the non price evaluation factors. In this case price may become the determining factor. Technical and price clarifications may be requested if deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer. All offerors are encouraged to submit their most favorable price and technical quotation, as the Government reserves the right to make award without further discussion.</p>
<p>BASIS OF AWARD<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>&#61654; Technical Approach <br />&#61654; Past Performance,<br />&#61654; Key Personnel Qualifications,<br />&#61654; Experience <br />&#61654; Price</p>
<p>Technical Approach, Past Performance, Key Personnel Qualifications and Experience when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>Each proposal will be evaluated based on the criteria stated below. Evaluation factors 1 - 4 are of equal value and when combined, are significantly more important than price, including any rebates proposed.</p>
<p>Factor 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH<br />The Government will evaluate the technical approach, methodology and analytical techniques to be used in fulfilling the technical requirements as identified in the PWS. The Government will evaluate the offeror's knowledge of providing vision benefits and how the offeror will use its corporate capabilities to support the requirements in this contract.</p>
<p>Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE<br />The Government will evaluate past performance as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully provide the services described in the PWS based on demonstrated relevant and recent past performance. The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance based on references provided from a minimum of three (3) different projects performed within the last three (3) years by the business unit that will perform this effort. These three (3) projects must be similar in size, scope, and complexity to the requirements identified in the Statement of Work. The evaluation will consider the extent of the offeror's recent relevant past performance and demonstrated ability to meet performance/technical requirements, schedule, customer satisfaction, responsiveness, and quality.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral rating for past performance. <br /><br />Factor 3: EXPERIENCE<br />The Government will evaluate experience as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to successfully perform this contract based on demonstrated relevant and recent experience with providing vision benefits. The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience with vision benefits contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity as the PWS and will utilize the reference information provided in the factor for "Past Performance" and any additional information, description, or demonstration of experience in the area of vision benefits provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Factor 4: KEY PERSONNEL AND STAFFING<br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed key personnel and staffing for qualifications and experience and commitment to qualified staff to support and meet the support services objectives and functional areas in the PWS.</p>
<p>PRICE/COST EVALUATION <br />Proposed price/cost will not be rated. The Contracting Officer will also conduct an appropriate price/cost analysis in accordance with applicable regulations</p>

<p>(IX) Offers will be evaluated on their price and technical acceptability.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award the contract to the offeror(s) who (a) asserts to the terms of the RFQ, and (b) has the best combination of experience, technical capability, and price. Experience is a matter of the number of opportunities an offeror has had to do similar work and to encounter the kinds of problems that the Contractor is likely to encounter in the performance of this contract. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a technical and cost standpoint, which the offeror can submit to the Government. However, the Government may, after evaluation of the proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate with all offerors whose proposals are within the competitive range.</p>
<p>(b) Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical and price factors considered.</p>
<p>(c) Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated with respect to the experience, technical, and price factors. The non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.</p>
<p>(d) Price will contribute significantly to the source selection decision and will be evaluated as to completeness, realism and reasonableness. The importance of price will increase as the degree of technical merit differences between competing proposals decreases. If technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in technical merit, price will become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>(X) The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (June 2009), with its quote or complete the Representations and Certifications on line at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GOV .</p>

Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the governments best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <BR><BR>FAR provision 52.212-2 is amended to read as follows: <BR><BR>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Price, past performance and technical capability of the services offered to meet the government requirement and overall intent of the Yellow Ribbon Conference shall be used to evaluate offers.  Technical is slightly more important than past performance.  When combined, technical and past performance are significantly more important than price.  (Evaluation factors and information required for submission are further addressed in an attachment to this solicitation.)<BR><BR>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>(c) In addition to other factors, quotes will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government which might result from making more than one award (multiple awards).  It is assumed, for the purpose of evaluating bids, $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation, and individual awards will be for the items or combinations of items which result in the best value to the Government, including the assumed administrative costs.  For the purposes of evaluating for multiple awards, each event will be considered a group and child care will be considered a separate group.  While offerors are not required to quote all groups, you must quote all services required within a group.  Example:  You can quote all services (line items) for each group.  You can quote all services (line items) for the September event and your quote will only be considered for this event.

<p>This requirement is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.</p>
<p>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase a Sputter Deposition System.</p>
<p><br />****All interested Contractor's shall provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p><br />Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Sputter Deposition Chamber System. The system must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award. The system must consist of all the following components:</p>
<p>The main purpose of the sputter deposition chamber is for in-house fabrication of Li-ion battery test structures. Specifically, the sputter chamber will be used to deposit a variety of materials including, but not limited to, metals (Al, Cr, Ni, Pt, etc) as well as oxides (LiCoO2, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4, LiTiOx, etc) and oxy-nitrides (LiPON).</p>
<p>The sputtering deposition system will be used to synthesize thin film hetero-structures consisting of complex oxides, nitrides, conventional semiconductors, and metals that will constitute electrochemical cells or their components capable of energy conversion and storage. The cell fabrication will be designed for the purposes of 1) fabricating electrochemical cells (batteries) of nanoscale dimensions, for example by means of the deposition of a thin film cell hetero-structure on top of silicon nanowires; 2) fabricating cells that can be subsequently converted with post-fabrication methods into nano-batteries, for example, creating a thin film battery, testing it, and then cutting it with Focused Ion Beam tool into a battery of nanoscale dimensions for subsequent characterization; 3) fabricating a component of an electrochemical cell for the characterization of its properties and performance at nanoscale level.</p>
<p>The sputter chamber system should meet or exceed the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. A stainless-steel chamber with dimension 14" high x 10" OD or larger; <br />2. Vacuum pumping capable of reaching of the base chamber pressure = 1.e-7 Torr;<br />3. Two magnetron sputtering sources with the capability of extension to 3 sources;<br />4. One DC and one RF generator for the sputtering sources;<br />5. Vacuum gauges capable of pressure monitoring in the range of 0.5 - 5.e-9 Torr;<br />6. A substrate holder with motorized rotation for uniform deposition with the deposited film thickness variation within 3% over a 4" diameter wafer. The substrate must allow for adjusting the working distance between the substrate and a sputtering source within 40mm range;<br />7. The system must have at least two gas inlets equipped with mass flow controllers;<br />8. Must have a motorized main chamber valve for automated pressure control;<br />9. Must have pneumatic shutter controls allowing remotely-controlled opening and closing of the magnetron sputter sources;<br />10. Must have a substrate heater for the temperature control of the sample while deposition in the range from room temperature to 600 degrees Celsius;<br />11. Must have magnetic transfer arm or equivalent transfer mechanism and the system capability to move the sample from and into an attached glove box (purchased by NIST, separately) in controlled environment or vacuum without exposing the sample to the ambient atmosphere;<br />12. Must have RF biasing capability of the substrate while heating, or rotation, or deposition with up to 50W RF power.</p>
<p>OPTION LINE ITEMS: The following line items are Option Line Items. The Contractor shall provide pricing for these items. The pricing shall be effective for one (1) year from the date of award. These Line Items will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5 and may be exercised at award or during option period set forth under FAR 52.217-7:</p>
<p>Option Line Item 0002: Automated pressure control;<br />Option Line Item 0003: A thin film thickness monitoring option;<br />Option Line Item 0004: Separately pumped sample load lock;</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Air Resources Laboratory (ARL), Atmospheric Turbulence Division (ATDD) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, has a requirement for a generator system designed to back up a Solar/Battery Power system for Arctic Regions.  NOAA/ARL/ATDD needs to install a  remote powered climate weather station on U.S. Forest Service lands near Tok, Alaska, in the fall of 2010 or spring of 2011.  This station will primarily be powered by a solar array of four (4) 200 watt panels charging a battery bank of six (6) 2 volt 1215 amp hour Concorde Sun Extender PVX-1215HT solar batteries ((dimensions 11.64" L x 6.95" W x 15.73" H) connected in series, for a 12 volt supply.  (The solar array and battery bank are not to be included in this quote. NOAA/ATDD will provide.)  All components at the station run on 12 volts and have a continuous current draw of 2 amps.  In addition to the continuous 2 amp load there is a heater on the precipitation gauge that draws an additional 6 amps about 30% of the time during periods of freezing precipitation.  The periods of precipitation will probably be less than 10 % of the time.  Due to low wind speeds during the winter period, wind generators are not included in the station design.<br /><br />This generator system will be used to supply battery charging during periods when incoming solar radiation is inadequate to supply enough charge to the batteries.  The requirements for the generator system will be as follows:<br /><br />1.	The generator could run on diesel, propane, or gasoline.<br />2.	If the fuel is liquid, the fuel tank needs to have a secondary containment system designed to contain leaks from the primary tank.<br />3.	The fuel system should have adequate capacity to run the generator for a complete winter season.  Provide rationale for determination that capacity is adequate.<br />4.	The generator system needs to be enclosed in such a way to protect it from the environment.  <br />5.	The enclosure system should have adequate space to house the generator, battery bank, and all charging regulators for the system.<br />6.	The system is required to operate in extreme arctic conditions to include the temperature range of -60C to +35C.<br />7.	The system should monitor the battery charge state and self start when needed.<br />8.	The system will need to be disassembled, transported to the site, and re-assembled by three people.    Components of up to 120 pounds would be acceptable.  Provide detailed assembly instructions.  (The assembly of the system onsite is not to be included in this quote.)<br />9.	The expected service interval for the system should be annually, but infrequent or unscheduled maintenance could be done if needed.  Therefore, the system is not intended to be designed with backups or redundancy.<br />10.	There is a noise requirement of less than 70 dB at 200 feet.<br />11.	The system is to include the charging components needed to connect the generator to the battery bank.<br />12.	Provide the footprint size of the design and list the major components, and total weight.  Provide a schematic drawing of the generator system.<br />13.	  The generator system is to be delivered to a point in Alaska to be determined.<br /><br />The company designing the system needs to  (1) demonstrate technical ability that they have experience in designing this type of generator system for arctic environments; (2) demonstration of past performance in providing a generator system by providing references.<br /><br />Interested parties are requested to include in writing, the company name, address, phone number, and DUNs number.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated primarily on technical functionality that fully meets our requirements.  All technical questions for this requirement should be directed to Mark Hall at 865-607-1737 or by email: Mark.Hall@noaa.gov.  The applicable NAICS code is 335312.  Response may be submitted by fax at 865-576-1327 or email: Sharon.Conger@noaa.gov by 5:00 pm, Monday, July 26, 2010.<br /><br />All costs associated with providing information as requested by this notice shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  Submission is voluntary.  It is required that all contractors doing business with the Government be registered with the Central Contractor's Registry (CCR) and complete the On-Line Representations and Certifications.  No award can be made to a company not registered in the CCR.

<DESC>National Policy
This is a combined synopsis solicitation for a commercial product prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is 100% set aside for small business in accordance with FAR 52.219-1 AND 52.219-6 (THIS MEANS YOU MUST BE A SMALL BUSINESS, QUOTING THE PRODUCT OF A SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTOR).

NO PRICING IS TO BE PROVIDED IN THE TECHNICAL APPROACH OR RELEVANT EXPERIENCE RESPONSE.  
Factor 1 - Technical Approach:  Limit 5 pages for Factor 1 response.  The Offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the requirements that are specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), to include each listed deliverable. The Offeror's technical approach must demonstrate the necessary skills, knowledge, and capabilities to successfully perform all tasks in the PWS.  The Offeror shall describe its Quality Control Program which should detail and describe the Contractor's framework and processes for delivering quality products and services as required by the PWS.  At a minimum, the Offeror's technical proposal shall demonstrate the following mandatory technical specifications:
.	An established record of historical publication and/or teaching;.	A demonstrated capability to collect, collate, and analyze historical data;.	A demonstrated capacity to interpret historically significant national security issues;
The Offeror's technical proposal will be evaluated based on its technical approach including detailed deliverables and performance standards as defined in the PWS and the mandatory technical specifications listed in the aforementioned bullets.  The Offeror shall respond with a line-by-line response attesting to full compliance to each item listed under the mandatory minimum technical specifications and address the ability to meet the desired delivery requirements defined in the PWS.
Factor 2 - Relevant Experience: The Offeror shall submit four copies of the relevant experience written narrative portion of the proposal.
The Government will assess each Offeror's relevant experience to determine whether they have performed efforts similar to those required under the PWS. The Government requests the Offeror provide a written narrative detailing their knowledge and experience, as it relates to their ability to reconstruct and analyze the roles of the Chairman of the JCS and JCS in the development of national security policy during the Johnson Administration Era. The narrative shall address the Offeror's familiarity with the topic, research design and execution experience, and writing and editing skills.  
The Offeror's Technical Approach and Relevant Experience will be evaluated using an adjectival rating of "Outstanding" "Good," "Acceptable," "Marginal," or "Unacceptable."  These adjectival ratings are defined in the table below:
ADJECTIVAL RATING        	DEFINITIONOutstanding	A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Good	A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.
Acceptable	A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Marginal	A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimum detail to indicate feasibility of approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problem with an overall high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirement.  Unacceptable	A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.

Factor 3 - Past Performance:  The Government will evaluate past performance for current relevancy within the last ten (10) years based on how well the Contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, size, scope, and complexity. The Contractor shall have a past performance that demonstrates successful execution and delivery of services in scope and type cited in the PWS. The Offeror shall submit the past performance matrix found at the end of the PWS as part of its response.  The Offeror will send the questionnaires to those listed on the matrix and request those companies complete and return the questionnaires back to the Contract Specialist via email by the closing date.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's demonstrated past or current effort. Basis of Evaluation: Evaluation will assess the likelihood of success in performing this requirement as indicated by the Offeror's record of past performance. The Government will also evaluate promptness and effectiveness of any necessary corrective action. The Government may also evaluate information gathered independently of the Offeror's submission to assess past performance (i.e., Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPARs)). Quality of performance is defined as the level of past performance provided which will be used as an indicator of the Offeror's probable performance as it relates to this acquisition. Offerors that would be eliminated from the competitive range solely based on negative findings in past performance will be given an opportunity to address such findings. A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of past performance can become an important consideration in the source selection process. Adverse Past Performance may result in an overall High-Risk rating. The Offeror is reminded to include all relevant past efforts, including demonstrated correction actions, in its proposal. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or where past performance information is not available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. A "Neutral" rating will be given.  Past performance evaluation adjectival ratings are described in the table below: 
ADJECTIVALRATING	DESCRIPTIONExceptional	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded many to the Government's benefit.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective action(s) taken by the Contractor were highly effective.Very Good	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements and exceeded some to the Government's benefit.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective action taken by the Contractor were effective.Satisfactory	The Offeror's performance met contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the Contractor appeared or were satisfactory.Marginal	The Offeror's performance did not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflected a serious problem for which the Contractor had not identified corrective actions.  The Contractor's proposed actions appeared only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.Unsatisfactory	The Offeror's performance did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery was not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contained a serious problem(s) for which the Contractor's corrective actions appeared or were ineffective.
Factor 4 - Price:  In determining the overall best value of the proposal, price is less important than the technical approach, management, and past performance. Price will not receive an adjectival rating. The Offeror's proposed payment schedule will be evaluated. When evaluating the price proposal, a determination will be made as to the Offerors' price reasonableness and completeness. The Offerors' proposals must demonstrate reasonable pricing that is aligned with the technical and management approaches.  Failure to address any of the instructions within this combined synopsis/solicitation may result in a proposal being considered unacceptable.  The Government will make a best value determination based on these factors.  Intent is to award based on initial offers.  If considered necessary by the Contracting Officer, discussions will be conducted only with those Offerors determined to have a reasonable chance for award.  Parties responding to this solicitation may submit their quote in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g. on company letterhead, formal quotes form, etc.) but must include the following information: 
1.)	Company's complete mailing and remittance addresses, discounts for prompt payment, if any (e.g. 1% 10 days), ability to meet delivery requirement and unit cost of product. 2.)	The company's CAGE code, DUNS Number, and Taxpayer ID number. 3.)	To reiterate, All FAR certifications and representations specified above must also accompany your quote unless available on line.

But, the psychology literature refers to inattentional blindness where users are so focused on their primary tasks that they literally don't see the messages and alerts. This eye-tracking tool will allow our research team to determine exactly where a person focuses on a computer screen. The eye-tracker should consist of a 24 inch monitor with the ability to track a user's left and right eyes and software to analyze the data, and provide statistical analysis. This system will be used to design and validate cyber-security interfaces and messages. It is difficult or impossible to do this without eye-tracking since we can't determine if the user did not actually see the elements of the interface or just choose to ignore them. With such a tool, we can actually determine which is true. In addition to supporting CNCI this tool will also support future research for DHS US-VISIT.</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is&nbsp;10 August 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about&nbsp;12 August&nbsp;2010. E-mail quotes are preferred and may be sent to Crystal.G.Taber@uscg.mil . Please indicate HSCG38-10-Q-200174 in subject line.

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />1. Technical Capability - this factor is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts. Only quotes from the OEM, an OEM approved vendor or prospective vendors that are able to provide clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria.</p>
<p>Offerors that have obtained a pass rating on the technical criteria listed above will then be evaluated on the following criteria in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>2. Price - The contractor shall provide pricing for requirements listed in this solicitation. Offers should indicate nomenclature, part number, unit price, and extended price, any discounts for prompt payment, business size standards, and minority classifications.</p>
<p>3. Delivery - The offer must include information on lead time and F.O.B. information IAW the requirements in this solicitation. All offers will be considered F.O.B. Destination unless F.O.B. origin is specified AND shipping costs are included. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that are able to deliver sooner than the required delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p>4. Past Performance (Relevant and recent) - The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>(Price is the most important evaluation factor, with Delivery being the second most important evaluation factor. Price and Delivery, when combined, are more important than Past Performance.)</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is August 9, 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>BACKGROUND:
The prevention and reduction of healthcare-associated infections is a top priority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The HHS Steering Committee for the Prevention of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) was established in July 2008 and developed the HHS Action Plan for the Prevention of Health-Associated Infections, which outlines a comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce healthcare-associated infections.  The Action Plan established national goals for healthcare-associated infection prevention and outlined key actions for achieving identified short and long-term objectives.  The Action Plan was intended to enhance collaboration with external stakeholders and to strengthen coordination and impact of national efforts. Recognizing that efforts to make progress hinge on the ability of states to lead and coordinate prevention efforts at the regional and state level. The 2009 Omnibus bill required states receiving Preventive Health and Health Services (PHHS) Block Grant funds to certify that they would submit a plan to reduce Health-Associated Infections to the Secretary of Health and Human Services not later than January 1, 2010. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a State HAI plan template to facilitate coordination with national HAI prevention efforts.  All 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico submitted plans that reflect current and proposed prevention activities, identify needs, and set realistic priorities and five-year targets.  By having each state identify its own goals based on the level of infrastructure and resources presently in place, HHS has been able to gather valuable information that is currently guiding our prevention efforts.

PURPOSE:
In May 2010, OPHS regional offices were encouraged to submit 2010 regional HAI Prevention Project proposals using information and data from the national and regional state HAI plans, the CDC review, and the expertise of HAI state advisory councils.  After a comprehensive review of materials, the RHA staff identified activities that could be implemented to address the HAI state/regional gaps, i.e., formative research with consumers on public reporting of infections rates, and education to healthcare personnel. 

HHS Region VI received funding to develop a regional HAI work group that includes infectious disease experts from each state, and other federal agencies/offices who will work together to develop website elements to be included in a health care-associated infection consumer friendly website.  The process work will involve designing focus group questions and survey information to obtain consumer input regarding health care-associated infections and potential use of this information to make informed health care decisions. 

STATEMENT OF WORK:
During FY 2010, a contractor will be selected to work with the regional/state HAI team to provide consultation and assistance 1) to research and evaluate existing national/state HAI websites that involve consumer information 2) to design consumer focus group questions 3) to identify state locations for two/three consumer focus groups  4) to identify and recruit focus group participants that is representative of the regional population,  5) to analyze focus group data  5) to plan monthly HAI regional taskforce conference calls, and one face-face meeting to finalize elements for the consumer website, and 6) to prepare a final report.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the answer to a question in response to the original synopsis solicitation.  There is no change to the original response due date.<BR><BR>The following question and answer is provided:<BR><BR>Question:  Our company is very interested in responding to this solicitation. The system that we have developed appears to meet all the requirements except:  - Permanent (non-superconducting) magnet at least equivalent to a 2.11 Tesla magnet operating at a 90 MHz proton frequency.   We presume that this requirement is due to the need for Helium in traditional superconducting magnet systems and the associated operational and safety risks.  Our company has developed cryogen-free (i.e. no helium and no nitrogen required for cooling) superconducting NMR systems, we would propose to offer such a system in lieu of a permanent magnet. Such a cryogen-free system has some advantages over permanent magnet systems as its performance is less susceptible to ambient temperature variations and the filed can be readily adjusted to suit different experiments.  As you will appreciate, considerable resources are required to respond to a solicitation. Therefore can you please advice whether the use of a cryogen-free superconducting magnet instead of a permanent magnet as stated in the solicitation is likely to adversely affect the technical evaluation - assuming that other technical criteria are similar.<BR><BR>Answer:  Operational and safety risk is definitely a major concern.  Also of concern would be whether or not your magnet would stand up to frequent, unplanned power outages and power fluctuations and the lead time to start up the instrument (i.e., how long it takes to cool down the magnet from a completely powered down state).  Proposing the use of a cryogen-free superconducting magnet instead of a permanent magnet would not adversely affect the technical evaluation - provided that your response contains clear and sufficient information for the Government to make a determination that it meets the performance characteristics and specifications as stated in the solicitation.  <BR>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<DESC>QUESTION 1:
We have a question regarding the provisions for final payment. Submitting the final report for the sole approval of the COR leaves a lot open for conjecture. It seems too subjective to be regarded as a definitive objective. Can this be reworded to state something more attainable in terms of fact?

ANSWER 1:
The purpose of the Definitional Mission Final Report is to assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed study, technical assistance, or other trade capacity building activity(ies).   

The provisions of issuing final payment upon approval of the final report is a standard USTDA practice. The COTR shall review and approve the Final Report and approve the Final Report based on the specifications outlined in RFQ.

<DESC><p><strong>*** UPDATE 12 APR 10 ***</strong></p>
<p>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100 and PIXS6441.</p>
<p>This notice is a follow-on sources sought synopsis to FBO # PIXS6441 posted on 23 Feb 10. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract.</p>
<p><strong>All substantive portions of the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis are incorporated by reference. The purpose of this follow-on sources sought synopsis is to clarify FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting." Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." It is the intention of the government to pursue the standard FAR clause language, wherein the small business prime contractor must intend to perform and demonstrate the capability to perform at least 50 percent of the entire scope of work described in the draft Performance Work Statement.</strong></p>
<p>Companies that responded to the 23 Feb 10 sources sought synopsis, please respond with your company name and confirm your interest in acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor, considering ability to comply with FAR 52.219-14. It is not necessary to resubmit any other information unless there has been a change.</p>
<p>Companies that did not respond to the previous sources sought synopsis, please respond with all of the information listed below. Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:</p>
<p>1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.</p>
<p>2.

<p>3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address.</p>

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with carbon copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil, robert.johnson4@wpafb.af.mil, and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil.</span></strong> All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx, will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by&nbsp;19 April 2010. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br /></span>*** UPDATE 05&nbsp;MAY 10 ***<br /><br /></strong>We are not presently holding any one-on-one meetings with industry.

<DESC>This modification is being issued to do the following:

1)  To add specifications for HR76, HRJ-8 and HRJ-5. Currently, there is no HR specification for ground diesel.  However, it is suggested that the ASTM D975 specification be used and blended as a 50/50 blend of HR Diesel.  See Attachment 1 with specifications.

2)  In reference to paragraph 2 of Part I: Short Term Objectives.  The quantities listed in Attachment 2 represent the 25% of bio-derived product required in the 50/50 blend ratio.  See Attachment 2.

3)  In reference to Part II: Long-Term Objective.  Paragraph three (3) under Process is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows:
DoD plans to hold an Industry Day to answer questions, seek additional information, and help establish the best market engagement strategy possible to ensure success in meeting the aggressive DoD goals of displacing large quantities of conventional petroleum derived aviation fuels with domestic renewable fuels. The dates for Industry Day are tentatively set for the afternoon of September 2nd and September 3rd to coincide with the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit and Expo to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from August 30  September 2, 2010. Please note the Industry Day is not part of, nor connected to, the Asia Pacific Clean Energy Summit. Additional details on the Industry Day will be posted on the DESC website (www.desc.dla.mil) and as supplemental information under this RFI.

4)  RFI response due date is hereby extended from July 30, 2010 to August 6, 2010.

The Fire Center will act as a station and staging area allowing for the increase and decrease of fire resources based on funding and need; and it will serve as home base for fire resources that can be strategically moved in the San Gabriel Canyon to provide coverage for high risk areas. The new Rincon Fire Station is designated to house three fire engines (Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East Fork). The current Rincon engine will remain at the Rincon Fire Station. The Crystal Lake and East Fork engines will be moved to the Rincon site. The water tender, fire prevention technician, and recreation personnel will continue to be co-located at the site. New facilities will be constructed at the Rincon site to house the three engines with personnel, the water tender with personnel, and the fire prevention technician with the Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East Fork engines. The A&amp;E will apply the values of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, sustainability and reliability creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to the Agency's values. The facility will meet Federal Energy Goals, security requirements and current codes governing the design. The proposed action will consist of the following: The existing Rincon, Crystal Lake, and East fork facilities will be demolished and replaced with a newly constructed approximately 5026 square foot energy efficient office/garage building, and one 10-person barracks at Rincon (with a possible option of second 10 person Barracks).

<DESC><p>During the prebid meeting on July 15, 2010 at 10:30 am, Barry Collins the COTR for the project clarified that the 18" by 100' pipe at M.P. 1.54 was not to be removed. This pipe was intentionally left off of the work list and out of the contract because too much vegetation will be disturbed to remove the pipe.</p>

Yellowstone National Park requires locating and disposal of unexploded ordnance in the Sylvan Pass Avalanche Zone. The following is a description of the requirement
1.0 Background
Snow avalanches in mountainous terrain are commonly controlled with the use of explosives as a way of protecting structures, roads and people.  Yellowstone National Park (YNP) Rangers have been minimizing the potential impacts of avalanches on oversnow travelers (snowmobile and snowcoaches) since 1971.  Each winter, YNP staff conduct numerous avalanche hazard mitigation missions intended to test the stability of the snowpack and trigger avalanches, by firing explosive ordnance into the avalanche paths above the East Entrance Road through Sylvan Pass.
The U.S. Department of Defense defines "explosive ordnance" as any munition, weapon delivery system, or ordnance item that contains explosives, propellants, or chemical agents.  The items are referred to as UXO if they (1) are armed or otherwise prepared for action; (2) are launched, placed, fired, or released in such a way that they cause hazards; and (3) remain unexploded either through malfunction or design.  UXO is present at Sylvan Pass because ordnance failed to fully detonate upon impact after being fired.
Until 1996, YNP staff fired 75 millimeter (mm) recoilless rifle rounds (M349 HEP-T with a M91 A1 base detonating fuse) at the target zones; however, some of these rounds did not explode as intended on impact and still contain dangerous high explosives.    Unless sufficient force is transferred to the fuze on impact, the round will dud.  In essence, this means that a low-angle shot at an oblique snowfield, had a high dud probability. In 1997, the 75mm recoilless rifle was replaced with a 105mm Howitzer.  The conversion of the avalanche artillery to 105mm point detonating round, dramatically reduced the number of duds produced.  In addition, procedures have been established to better document and recover duds that might occur with the Howitzer.  
Prior to 2003, Yellowstone staff occasionally conducted visual searches for UXO on the south-facing slopes of Sylvan Pass. The frequency and success of these efforts is largely undocumented, though it is known that military EOD teams disposed of 75 mm rounds on several occasions.  
In September 2003, the State of Montana, Department of Military Affairs (DMA), with the assistance of Tetra Tech EM inc. completed the first systematic search for unexploded ordnance within selected portions of the Sylvan Pass avalanche zones.  During the 8-day effort, 17 ordnance and explosives items were located.  The rounds were rendered safe by military explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) technicians from Fort Carson, Colorado. 
From 2008 - 2010, Sylvan Pass Avalanche staff conducted six UXO searches in the slides paths, as well as along the roadside at Sylvan Pass. The searches concentrated on areas of known coordinates of unexploded (or low order) Howitzer rounds and helicopter dispensed hand charges.  In 2009, one Howitzer round was located and in 2010, three 75mm rounds were located in starting zones above the Pass.  In June 2010, an EOD teams from Malstrom AFB, disposed of the four unexploded rounds.  This work, and the subsequent UXO disposal, was documented and mapped using GPS.  
2.0 Project Area Description
The base of the Sylvan Pass avalanche zone is located at an elevation of approximately 8,530 feet, along the East Entrance Road of Yellowstone National Park. From the roadside, the avalanche paths vary in length but the many of the paths extend to the ridge top at an elevation of 10,100 feet. The slope angles throughout the avalanche zones vary from 25 degrees to 50 degrees, with the steeper angles existing near the upper portions of the avalanche paths. The entire avalanche zone is trapezoidal in shape, measuring approximately 12,000 feet wide along the roadway, and approximately 4,000 feet wide near the ridge top.  Talus and scree dominate the south-facing slope and extend from the upper reached of the avalanche paths to the base of the paths at the roadway.  The talus varies is size from small gravel to large boulder-sized blocks. Steep cliff bands are intermittently present at various locations throughout the slope. In general, vegetation found on the slopes consists of coniferous trees and shrubs with minimal soil cover. 
YNP staff has identified over twenty paths that have produced, or are capable of producing, avalanches.  Within each path, established target points have been used historically during hazard mitigation missions. Additional target points, or slight modifications to the established target points, have been used to increase effectiveness of ordnance placements. From the permanent Howitzer gun mount, south of the road, all avalanche paths can be seen.  Directly across from the gun mount, a gravel crushing operation is located at the base of the several avalanche paths.   
3.0 Scope
Yellowstone National Park recognizes the need for periodic reconnaissance and disposal of UXO at Sylvan Pass.  Through careful planning and project coordination, a systematic search for UXO will only be conducted when and where there will be minimal risk to personnel. Due to the potential hazards of this project, field personnel must be experienced in locating explosives and working in steep, unstable terrain.      
The purpose of the contract is to enlist subject matter experts in planning, directing and documenting field operations to accomplish the project objectives outlined below.  
4.0 Project Objectives
Conduct a visual search for UXO at priority areas at Sylvan Pass to minimize the UXO exposure risk to visitors, employees and contractors.Conduct visual search in specific locations of UXO rounds that have been documented but have not been retrieved. Use hand-held instrumentation to detect below surface UXO in priority areas.Organize team(s) so as to have the greatest likelihood of locating and mapping UXO in high priority areas of the upper avalanche paths and near the roadway.Map areas of coverage and UXO locations.Dispose of detected UXOs by detonation on-site, when possibleEvaluate safety of all field operations and risk to personnel on an ongoing basis and postpone or suspend operations, if indicated.   5.0 Tasks
The NPS will be responsible for the following:
Provide an NPS Liaison to the ContactorProvide an Avalanche Specialist for technical knowledge and expertise in Sylvan Pass avalanche operations.  Avalanche Specialist will be available for pre-mission consultation and for assistance during field activities.  Provide documentation of known UXO coordinates and a map identifying areas of priority to be searched.  (See attachment A)Provide personnel to conduct systematic searches of priority areas, as assigned by the Project Leader.  Personnel must have experience and physical ability to access (hike) and perform work in steep, unstable terrain (over 30 degrees). NPS will:Provide first aid kits, hard hats, safety vests, PPE for NPS field personnelProvide hand-held GPS units for each searcher.Provide radios for all field personnelCoordinate a pre-mission site visit and briefing for the Contractor. Establish exclusion areas and control traffic, if needed, to protect public safety.Provide an on-site ambulance and EMT.Manage any visitor or media visits to the project site.
The Contractor will provide:
A Safety, Health and Emergency Response Plan (SHERP), or similar.  The SHERP will provide guidelines to protect personnel, the public, and the environment from hazards associated with site activities and potential site contaminants. A Project Leader responsible for directing and implementing all activities performed to locate and document UXO in priority areas at Sylvan Pass.A Site Safety Officer (SSO) to ensure that the SHERP and all pertinent health and safety policies are followed, and that the project is conducted so as to protect the health and safety of personnel.  A project completion report that will include documentation of areas searched, GPS track logs or maps, and locations of newly discovered UXO. The report will also include recommendations for future UXO detection and disposal projects.Daily report recording all relevant health and safety issues, daily safety briefings,field inspections, accident/injury occurrences and near-misses.Military EOD assistance, when needed, for disposal of located UXO
Minimum qualifications for UXO technicians and personnel providing services under this contract will be at or above the UXO Technician Level III or above, as defined by the DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB).

6.0 Government Furnished Property
The Contractor will furnish all property to complete the tasks listed.
7.0 Security
The south-facing slopes within the project area are closed to public entry throughout the year.  NPS will provide security during the project to ensure that no one enters the closure.  The East Entrance Road will be closed for short periods of time, when field work or UXO detonation poses the potential of rock fall on the roadway. 
8.0 Special Considerations 
Physical, Biological and Chemical Hazards 
Uneven and steep terrain - slip, trip and fall hazardsRock fall and sliding scree and debrisVehicle on East Entrance Road and travel enroute to project siteLarge animals such as deer, moose, elk, bear Weather - rain, snow, ice, wind, lightening, cold temperaturesStress and fatigue- loss of situational awarenessAnimal bites and stings UXO hazards and chemical exposures unrelated to UXO at Sylvan Pass
Safe Work Practices

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER THE IDIQ CONTRACT NUMBER AG-3A75-C-0023.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is announcing a project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposal for A&E Services under the IDIQ Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0023.  A Task Order will be issued to Black & Veatch Special Project for independent design review of an ARRA Watershed Rehabilitation project in the state of Kentucky: Fox Creek Site 4.  The NAICS code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design Review with detail cost proposal from Black & Veatch Special Project is due no later than close of business on July 23, 2010.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein: 

 I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
	Addresses unique site conditions 
	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

Sources Sought Synopsis Diagnosing and Monitoring Alzheimer Disease (AD) in vivo using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy

Contracting Office Address:
VAMC Providence, Mailstop 650/90C, 623 Atwells Avenue, Providence, RI 02909-2472

 This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: the availability and present capability of qualified sources to fulfill the Government requirement.   Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. 
Background

The molecular bases of Alzheimer disease and related neuordegenerative disorders are becoming better understood, but the means for definitive diagnosis and monitoring in vivo remain lacking.  Near-infrared optical spectroscopy (NIR) offers a potential solution.   Transmission and reflectance spectra of thin brain tissue slabs have been used to calculate wavelength-dependent absorption and reduced scattering coefficients from 470-1000 nm.  The reduced scattering coefficients in the near-infrared clearly differentiated Alzheimer Disease from control specimens.  Diffuse reflectance spectra of gross brain tissue in vitro have confirmed this observation.  These results suggest a means for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer disease in vivo using near-infrared optical spectroscopy.

Introduction
Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive, terminal, neurodegenerative disorder.  The largest risk factor for AD is advanced age, and the public health impact of AD and related disorders is increasing in proportion to the senior population served by US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).    

Purpose and Objectives 
The VA seeks solutions for the early diagnosis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders by using non-invasive NIR in vivo to characterize the light-scattering signatures of dense protein aggregates.
Interested contractors should consult the following paper for additional purpose and objectives: Reference: E.B Hanlon, L. T. Perelman, E. I. Vitkin, F. A. Greco, A. C. McKee, N. W. Kowall, Optics Letters 33, 624 (March 15, 2008) (Scattering Differentiates Alzheimer disease in vitro).


The VA will assess the responses to this Sources Sought notice to determine the present existing ability and capacity in the contractor community to execute the tasks described in the requirements.

 Requirements
The contractor shall design, fabricate and test near-infrared (NIR) optical spectroscopy technology for the non-invasive detection, diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease and related neurodegenerative disorders (AD), including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).  The design, fabrication and testing shall be carried out in collaboration with and according to specifications developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS), Seattle, WA.

2.	Description of Action:  This justification is for other than open competition for maintenance and repair services to be performed by Advance Sterilizer Products (Johnson & Johnson Health Care System INC). 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The VAPSHCS has a requirement for the vendor to perform preventive and corrective maintenance services on the Sterrad NX Sterilization System. This equipment is critical for the Medical Center's continuous sterilization process. 

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(x)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) Advance Sterilizer  	Products is the only vendor authorized to service this equipment. IAW FAR 6.302-	2(a)(2)(b)(2) delay in the award of this requirement could result in serious injury to  	our Veterans. Services performed by unauthorized vendors and the installation of 	unauthorized parts could result in costly damage to equipment.

6. 	Actions to Promote Competition:  IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2) the proposed contract 	action is urgent and compelling. The referenced vendor is the only known source for 	this service, there is no known secondary source.  
  
7.   Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the  
      Government is $18,252.13.  IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii). Based on historical cost for
