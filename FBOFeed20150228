award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has
not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open
competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this

www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures
identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's
experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you
have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being
evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which
forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to
provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous
submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be
considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a
