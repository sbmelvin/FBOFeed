<a href="mailto:yesik.cho@us.army.mil">US Army Contracting Command Korea</a>
<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command Korea has a requirement for Senior Observers and After Action Review Facilitators in support of exercises in the Republic of Korea.  Recently, the US and ROK governments agreed to transition wartime operational command and control (OPCON) of ROK forces to the ROK military in 2012.  This will result in the inactivation of the current U.S. led Combined Forces Command, and the establishment of a U.S. complementary supporting joint command in Korea.  This will be a challenging transition for both the U.S. and ROK from organizational structures and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that have been practiced in Korea for decades.  This requires a qualified Senior Observer and Facilitator team with experience in operations in the Korea Theater of Operations (KTO).  This transformation SRO and Facilitator team is expected to consistently support the Commanders exercise program traveling to the Republic of Korea several times a year. This team will use USFKs Organizational and Operational Concept Plan; Transformation Master Plan; and Training and Exercise Objectives to support USFKs incremental transformation between FY 2008 and FY 2012.  Accordingly, this team shall thoroughly understand these documents and their impact on our overall transformation and certification effort; recommend updates to them as appropriate; and provide continuity throughout the transformation period. This team will provide theater level command and control expertise, support the After Action Reviews (AARs) of  the:  Alliance, US KORCOM and ROK Joint Forces Command, observe the exercises, participate in senior leader seminars and validate potential AAR issues and facilitate discussion of these issues for the commander, his staff and component commands. This team will keep USFK leadership apprised of transformation progress to include recommended adaptations to ensure all USFK Transformation requirements are met by FY 2012.  It is anticipated that a cost plus award fee contract will be awarded with a period of performance from 1 August 2008 through 31 July 2013 (including option years). Solicitation will be issued and posted to the FedBizOpps and https://contracting.korea.army.mil/contracting/Solicitations/CONUS.htm   approximately thirty days from the date or later of this synopsis.  Further details regarding the solicitation and conference will be posted to the website link referenced above.  Point of contact: Ms. Dana D. Harris, 822-7914-6296, email: dana.pavey@us.army.mil or dana.harris@korea.army.mil.<BR>

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST). This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departments networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIs BIMC project needs. The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives Systems must have front video/USB ports Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The requested HP server fulfills the following critical requirements: The server must utilize Intels quad-core 5400 series processors that generate no more than 80 watt of heat. The processors shall operate at a minimum of 3.0GHz and employ a 1333 MHz FSB. There are Intel quad-core processors that generate 100 and 120 watts, but they exceed our maximum heat threshold. Note: If Intels 50 watt Quad Core processors are available at the time of purchase, then the 50 watt processor will supersede our original 80 watt requirement, and be the preferred choice. The server form factor must not be greater than 2U The server must support a minimum of (8) internal 2.5 inch SAS hard drives Servers must be configured with 16Gb of memory and have the ability to expand to 32Gb without discarding original memory Server power supplies must be rated by the manufacture at a minimum of 800 watts. The vendor must be able to provide emergency maintenance within a 4-hour response time, 24/7CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration. The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers server configurations or to manage multiple vendors yearly support and maintenance agreements.The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline. The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

For example, in response to the Childrens Health Act, Dr. Foote was responsible for establishing a temporary advisory committee, which joined DHHS , other agencies and departments as well.  Dr. Foote has testified to Congress repeatedly on autism research issues that remain contentious and are still important focal points for NIH interactions with the advocacy community.  Additionally, Dr. Foote led the implementation of the congressionally mandated STAART centers program, which has a direct counterpart in the Combating Autism Act.  

Dr. Foote, will lead discussions with the Federal Advisory Committee and draft the scientific content of the strategic plan for the NIMH.   The period of performance is 4 months for a total amount of 624 hours.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price modification to contract N00421-07-C-0081, to BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration Inc., 450 Pulaski Road, Greenlawn, NY 11740-1606.  BAE Systems was awarded the competitive contract to provide (8) First Article Conformal-Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (C-CRPA) systems to support the F/A-18 Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) effort.  This quantity was based on estimates that have proven insufficient to support the F/A-18 flight test.  Subsequent analyses of F/A-18 flight test requirements now require six (6) additional antenna systems.  
This follow on is for the procurement of (6) developmental and testing C-CRPA to support the F/A-18 flight test.The C-CRPA is specifically applicable to the dorsal fuselage of the F/A-18 Aircraft.  Its conformal design is dependent upon proprietary technical data.  BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration Inc. owns the proprietary technical data required to produce and deliver the C-CRPA for the F/A-18 flight test.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) intends to issue a follow-on five-year sole-source indefinite delivery - indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Lockheed Martin Federal Systems (LMFS), Owego, New York for continued engineering services in support of the Organic AMCM systems and MH-60S helicopter integration as well as fabricating production integration equipment including, but not limited to Common Consoles.  The purpose of this effort is to ensure the integration and interoperability of five separate AMCM sensors on the MH-60S helicopter. The proposed AMCM system sensors to be incorporated in the MH-60S are as follows:
AQS-20/X Advanced Sonar System (in-water towed system)Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS)Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS)Rapid Airborne Mine Combat System (RAMICS)Organic Airborne and Surface Influence Sweep (OASIS) 
This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. LMFS, Owego is the sole developer and integrator of the avionics and C4I suite on the MH-60S helicopter. LMFS is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to perform the required engineering studies and interface requirement definition analysis required for the integration of the AMCM suite of sensors into the helicopter. Thus, this acquisition is for continued provision of highly specialized services within the meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Additionally, this commonality for logistics purposes has the potential of reducing the life cycle cost of the MH-60S / Organic AMCM capability. LMFS has spent over eight years developing the avionics systems on the MH-60S and is the only vendor with the prerequisite knowledge of what it will take to integrate these systems. Only LMFS has the unique knowledge base and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Wing Inflatables, Inc., 1132 Somoa Blvd., Arcata, CA 95521, on a sole-source basis for sponson sets for the 11 Meter Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat  (11M NSW RIB).  The 11M NSW RIB is a high-speed combatant craft used by the Special Boat Teams to support the Maritime Special Operations mission. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition because the government does not own the technical data package or specifications for the sponsons and the sponsons manufactured by Wings Inflatable are the only sponsons that have been tested, certified, and approved by the US Navy for use on the RIBs.  Firms desiring to have their product certified for future requirements must contact Mark Brinkerhoff at Mark.Brinkerhoff@navsoc.navy.mil, phone 619-437-0840.  The certification process would take between 12 and 18 months and would require the contractor to provide approximately 5 complete sets of sponsons, at no charge to the Government, for testing.

<a href="mailto:valerie.hawthorne@navy.mil">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement to modernize Air Combat On Line (ACOL) application for the Air Combat Training System (ACTS), with subsequent support for ACTS.  ACOL is a Learning Management System (LMS) application approved for servers attached to DoDs Secure Internet Protocol Routing Network (SIPRNET), and ACTS is the system infrastructure that ensures access to ACOL for Navy Air Crews at home, at sea, and deployed.  NAVAIR has asked the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) to put ACOL Modernization and ACTS support under contract.
The primary objective of the base ACOL Modernization effort is to provide ACOL with Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 2004 conformance while retaining all existing training progress data, as well as the ability for trainees to continue to use existing SCORM 1.2 courses.  The effort envisions several enhancements to capture some of the LMS industry best practices, but such enhancements are only desirable within the limits of affordability.  The successful offeror will be afforded the opportunity to support ACTS through four successive Option Years.  Parties interested in this requirement shall contact Valerie.hawthorne@navy.mil,(717)605-3946,Contracting Officer NAVICP. NAVICP will utilize an on line communication/collaboration tool called the eProcurement system to post the Request for Proposal, attachments and other pertinent information. All communications between the Contracting Officer and the vendor, as well as uploading of technical and price proposals will occur through the tool. The Contracting Officer will initiate vendor registration in the eProcurment system to allow access and participation.

<CONTACT>Shapleigh Drisko, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-875-6010, Fax 703-516-1520, Email driskosc@state.gov
<DESC>The Department of State anticipates the competitive award of a one-year base plus four one-year option period follow-on requirements contract to provide a source of Workers' Compensation Insurance as required by the Defense Base Act (DBA).  Under this follow-on program, the requirement to provide overseas contractor employees with insurance coverage pursuant to the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act/ Defense Base Act would be done by a single insurance carrier during the contract duration, for all eligible Departmental contractors unless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.  The successful insurance carrier shall deal directly with the companies requiring DBA insurance for payment arrangements and resolution of issues.  No Government funds will be allocated under any agreement or contract for performance of this program.  Reimbursement/premiums for DBA insurance will come from individual Department of State contracts requiring DBA coverage.     

The purpose of this contract is to provide a source of Worker's Compensation Insurance (excluding the Aviation Support Services Contract) as required by the Defense Base Act (DBA). Under all Department of State (DOS) financed service and construction contracts, involving any overseas performance, the contractor is required by law to provide overseas employees with such insurance pursuant to the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (commonly called the "Defense Base Act" or "DBA") (42 U.S.C. 1651 e t seq.). DBA insurance coverage applies to individuals employed under DOS Contracts or subcontracts or subordinate contracts regardless of the duration of their assignment, and is over and above any State Worker's Compensation Insurance coverage.

DBA insurance coverage is required for employees of contractors (and their subcontractors) unless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor (See FAR 28.305). However, the waiver does not apply to any employee who is:
a. Hired in the United States;
b. A resident of the United States; or,
c. A citizen of the United States.

A fixed-price, requirements type of contract for the services specified and for the period stated is anticipated.

All DOS contractors procuring DBA insurance (i.e. renewing coverage or obtaining new coverage) for a DOS financed contract, or subcontract at any tier which require overseas services, are required by Department of State Acquisition Regulation (DOSAR) and the terms of their contracts to purchase such DBA insurance under this requirements contract.

DOS non-personal services contracts with individuals are also subject to DBA coverage. Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) are exempt from Defense Base Act coverage; they are covered by the Federal Employees Compensation Act.

All DOS direct contractors must procure DBA insurance under this requirements contract unless they are a DBA self-insurance program approved by the Department of Labor.

The Departments current requirements contract for DBA insurance is with the Continental Insurance Company, DBA CNA Insurance, 333 S. Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL.

<DESC>Within the office of Business, Environment, Agriculture and Trade (BEAT) at USAID/Ethiopia, there are three nominal divisions: 1) Policy, 2) Trade and Private Enterprise Development, and 3) Pastoralism and Livestock Development.  The BEAT office, through these divisions, promotes: agriculture and economic policy reform; business and market development; livestock and pastoralist development; and food security and livelihoods for vulnerable populations.  Other BEAT programs support the impact of the nominal divisions.

Over the past five years, budget levels in the BEAT office have fluctuated as a result of shifting foreign assistance priorities and the periodic availability of alternative funding sources to support long term development.  Over this same time period, USAID/Ethiopia/BEAT has sought to break the cycle of deepening livelihoods crises in Ethiopia.  Climactic shock perpetuates livelihoods crises and results in the loss of on-farm assets which undermine economic development and make people cyclically more vulnerable to shock. 
The purpose of this solicitation is to procure the services of a USPSC/TCN Contractor to work as technical advisor for a number of cross-sectoral projects and issues within the USAID Mission. The Contractors primary responsibility will be to serve as technical advisor for projects with USAID/Ethiopias Pastoralist portfolio. The contractor will be expected to bring specific expertise in development initiatives pertaining to pastoralist programs. The contractor will also serve as a member of the cross-sectoral team, supporting and developing  the linkages between the Business, Agriculture, Environment and Trade (BEAT) Office, the USAID/East Africa/ Regional Enhanced Livelihoods in Pastoral Areas (RELPA) Programs, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP) in Pastoralist areas, and conflict mitigation components of ongoing and new programs with programmatic and geographic linkages to pastoral areas of Ethiopia.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Description:  The Northwestern Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  These A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part Subpart 36.6.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Kansas City and Omaha Districts environmental missions, although the resulting contracts may include work at other locations throughout the Northwestern Division.<BR>Contract Information:  The Government intends to award up to three contracts, totaling $20 million, from this announcement.  The contracts are intended for 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, one in each category.  The 8(a) contract is planned to be awarded for $10 million, while the HUBZone and SDVOSB contracts are planned to be $5 million each.  In the event that the solicitation process for either the HUBZone or SDVOSB set-asides results in no firms being ranked as most highly qualified, the Government may proceed to make alternate awards using the following process:  HUBZone: the contract capacity may be used for the next most highly qualified ranked SDVOSB firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm, in that order; SDVOSB: the contract capacity may be used for the next most highly qualified ranked HUBZone firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm, in that order. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330.  For this procurement, a firm is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less.  The period of performance for each contract will be one year, with four (4) one-year option periods.  Selections are expected to be made in June 2008.  It is anticipated that the first contract will be awarded no earlier than July 2008.  One or more months may elapse between subsequent contract awards.  Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period.  These task orders will be firm fixed-price type orders.  For the 8(a) contract, no single task order will exceed $500,000 or five years in duration.  For the HUBZone and SDVOSB contracts, no single task order will exceed $250,000 or five years in duration.  When a requirement is identified, the Government Project Delivery Team will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing project.  Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases, such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and design.  If it is a follow-on requirement, every effort will be made to assign the task order to the original A-E as long as they have the capability to perform.  A firms experience, qualifications, past performance, capability and capacity will be considered in the determination of task order assignments.  The period of performance for task orders awarded under these IDCs will be based upon the work requirement and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents.  The Service Contract Act, as amended in 1965, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will incorporate the provisions of that act.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.  Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and previously found in solicitations.  Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.<BR>Project Information:  Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state and local regulations and laws and within the required time frames.  Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order.  Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting.  Assignments may include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), and working on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental type projects, including radioactive and mixed wastes, energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, use of recovered materials, underground storage tanks and fueling systems, habitat restoration and mitigation, and sites potentially contaminated with military munitions.  For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<BR>Selection Criteria: (A) Primary Selection Criteria.  Selection of firms will be based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firms team demonstrated during the past five (5) years in the broad range of environmental work required for this contract including (a) Investigation, planning, design, and construction phase services for a variety of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste cleanup projects.  Experience must demonstrate wide-ranging capabilities for diverse projects with differing contaminants in various media; (b) Knowledge of and adherence to regulations and practices pertaining to hazardous waste sampling, handling, transportation and disposal including RCRA, CERCLA, CWA, TSCA, and NEPA; (c) Oversight of Remedial Investigation, Feasibility Study, Remedial Design, Remedial Action, and Long Term Response Action projects performed by other parties, in conformance to their respective consent decrees or administrative orders; (d) Demonstrated quality management procedures.  Include a narrative description of quality management procedures and implementation to include internal quality control, responsibilities, and a proposed organization chart.   Firms will be evaluated for the degree in which their team possesses experience and competence in these four areas ((1)(a) through (1)(d), above).  The most highly qualified firms will have extensive experience in all of these areas; (2) Professional qualifications of firms staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract.  The education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience, longevity with the firm, and experience of personnel working together with key management and other technical personnel will be considered.  This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under the capacity criterion below.  Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in these primary disciplines, which are listed in descending order of importance.  List professional registrations, if applicable, for the disciplines: (a) Environmental engineer; (b) Chemical process engineer; (c) Chemist; (d) Risk Assessor; (e) Hydrogeologist; (f) Project Manager; (g) Civil Engineer; (h) Geotechnical engineer; (i) Industrial hygienist; (j) Health physicist; (k) Cost engineer; (l) Geologist; (m) Archaeologist; (n) Biologist; (o) Mechanical engineer; (p) Electrical engineer; (q) Architect/Landscape Planner; and (r) Structural Engineer; (3) Past performance on DOD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  ACASS is the primary source of information on past performance. ACASS will be queried for all firms submitting a proposal.  When deemed appropriate by the evaluation board, performance evaluations for any significant team subcontractors who have previously been prime A-E contractors may also be considered.  The board may seek information on past performance from other sources, but it is not required to seek other information on the past performance of a firm, if none is available from ACASS.  The board will consider the relevance of each performance evaluation to the proposed contract, including the type of work, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance.  A firm that has earned excellent evaluations on recent DOD A-E contracts for similar projects will be ranked relatively high on past performance; (4) Capacity.  The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines from the prime firm and its team consultants to perform work in the required time; (5) Knowledge of the locality.  The board will evaluate a firm's familiarity with local conditions.  Examples include knowledge of, and experience dealing with, the state and local regulatory agencies, geological features, climatic conditions or local construction methods that are unusual or unique. Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area; therefore, responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities.  (B) Secondary Selection Criterion.  The secondary criterion will only be used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms.  The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation.  The secondary selection criterion is Volume of DOD Contract Awards.  Responding firms should cite all contract numbers, award dates, and total negotiated fees for any DOD contract or task order awarded within the past twelve (12) months. Submittal Requirements: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus five (5) copies of SF330 (06/2004 edition) for the prime firm and all team consultants.  Section H of the SF 330 is limited to twenty (20) pages with double-sided sheets counting as two pages.  For all SF 330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font.  A contract-specific Quality Control Plan will be prepared and submitted by the A-E after contract award, but is not required with this submission.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  This is not a request for proposal.  Submittals must be mailed or delivered to the following address not later than 28 May 2008, 2:00 p.m. local time: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Attn: CENWK-CT-H (Thomas), 757 Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, MO 64106-2896.  No faxed or other electronic submittals will be accepted.

<SOLNBR>AAC685ARSS080424
<RESPDATE>061308
<CONTACT>Grisselle R Nusimow, Contracting Officer, Phone (850)883-0520, Email grisselle.nusimow@eglin.af.mil - David A Fennell, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)883-0250, Fax (850)883-2360, Email david.fennell@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Air Force Air Armament Centers 685th Armament Systems Squadron is interested in obtaining information from the global armament and munitions industry on viable ammunition that potentially meets requirements specified in this special announcement. 

The US Government intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to evaluate proposed medium caliber ammunition. The 685th Armament Systems Squadron requests assistance in identifying potential 25mm x137 ammunition for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter gun system in all combat environments. 

The F-35 is a joint USAF/USN/USMC and US-Partner developmental aircraft program in SDD with a projected USAF Initial Operational Capability of 2013.  Over the next 20+ years, the F-35 will replace the USAF F-16 and A-10 and become the primary frontline fighter aircraft for the USAF.  The USAF variant F-35/A is armed with the GAU-22A which is a 25mm 4-barrel gun system and ammunition handling system, and will begin on aircraft gun firing in 2011.  This gun system is currently in development by Lockheed Martin.

None of the existing 25mm combat ammunition within the DoD inventory (PGU-20/25/32) can achieve the USAF required lethality.  Recent training and combat experiences validate the importance of supporting gun systems and their ammunition for effective support for ground forces.  Additionally, the F-35/A gun system requirements include an air-to-air lethality capability.  Due to the limited available ammunition storage capacity on the F-35, ammunition with a multi-role dual-purpose projectile design must be employed to meet lethality requirements. 

This Request for Information is limited to those requirements specifically provided in the first attachment to this synopsis under the same FEDBIZOPS tracking number as (Attachment 1). 

Proposed test articles shall include only those mature enough to enter service in the very near term.  As such, the proposed ammunition must have demonstrated a Technology Readiness Level7.  

Note: Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) are a systematic metric/measurement system that supports assessments of the maturity of a particular technology and the consistent comparison of maturity between different types of technology. TRL-7 specifically is defined as a prototype near or at planned operational capability. TRL-7 represents a major step up from testing in a high fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment. TRL-7 requires the demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment, such as in an aircraft.  

It is requested that responses include rough order of magnitude unit prices for initial testing and then possible follow-on procurement. 

Responses to this RFI require the use of a Template (provided in attachment 2) also posted under this synopsis tracking number. Each response shall not exceed ten pages, by expanding blocks of the attached template to provide the details of each response. The attached template is compulsory for a submission to be considered responsive. Vendor responses must be received at the: Air Armament Center, 207 West D Avenue, Suite 301, Bldg-349, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6088 (Mail Stop: 685ARSS/RFI) 

Offerors responding to this RFI are requested to send an e-mail to below listed POCs to advise us you are actively working a response.  Responses to this market survey are due on or before June, 13 2008.

Data submissions are to be submitted via Email attachment for unclassified data using MS Word 2003 format or via authorized delivery means for classified data under DOD security procedures. Mark all proprietary information as For Official Government Use Only. 

This request for information is intended to obtain information to quickly acquire F-35 required ammunition, minimize development and testing resources at a significant avoidance of Life Cycle Cost. This solicitation is for information purposes only. This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor shall any information submitted by industry constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract based solely upon this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<DESC><p>
<p>The Advanced Pointer Tracker (APT) is a mobile 60 cm telescope system used for visible, short-wave and mid-wave imaging as well as for 1.04-1.06um high power laser beam propagation. The telescope output aperture is currently configured with a segmented ZnSe window or operated open to the atmosphere. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate is seeking proposals for a 68 cm high purity monolithic window for installation on the output aperture of the telescope. AFRL is seeking information to determine if industry has the capability to build this window to the given requirements before committing funds.</p>
<p>The 68cm exit window must provide an imaging capability from 0.6 microns to at least 3.5 microns and preferably through the 5.0 micron region. The window must maintain high hardness, high strength, durability, low bulk absorption, low scattering, and low change in index with respect to temperature change (dn/dT) at the 1.06 micron laser wavelength region. The figure of merit for this window is the maximum allowable optical distortion under the specified laser loading which combines the features of bulk absorption, CTE, dn/dT and thickness. The window must be suitable for polishing/coating and utilization in an outdoor environment. The maximum weight of the window is somewhat flexible and should be based on structural and optical distortion limitations of the proposed substrate considering it is mounted on dynamic beam director.</p>
<p><br />Specific Requirements:<br />Diameter: 68cm<br />Clear Aperture: 65cm<br />Maximum distortion introduced by transmission through window<br />@ 1&#61472;&#61549;m: 1/5 wave P-V for 100W/cm2 loading for 30 seconds<br />Surface Quality: 40/20<br />Bulk Absorption &lt;100ppm/cm<br />Transmission &gt; 99.8 % for 1.06 &#61549;m (2o AOI)<br />Transmission &gt; 90% average for all other wavelengths (0.6-3.5&#61472;&#61549;m or 0.6-5.0um)<br />Laser Damage Threshold: &gt;1kW/cm2 CW @ 1.06um<br />Storage Environment: -23 to 55 degrees Centigrade (-9 to 131 degrees Fahrenheit) up to 100% humidity<br />Operational Environment: -1 to 41 degrees Centigrade (30 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit) up to 80% humidity<br />Environmental Test: Substrate and coating must be pass equivalent of MIL-C- 48497A for adhesion, humidity, moderate abrasion, temperature, solubility and cleanability and water solubility. <br />Load: Structure must be crash worthy (9 g crash loads in one direction, 4 g sides, 3 g down), flight vibrations as cargo (1-3 g), transportation loads (3 g), etc.</p>
<p><br />Businesses having the capability to perform this work are invited to submit a statement of capability (SOC) in order for the Government to determine whether the acquisition should go forward. The SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Experience in design and fabrication of high-energy windows</p>
<p>(2) Ability to design, fabricate, coat, and deliver, a window for reasonable cost and schedule.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify, and obtain information from, responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems at the United States Military Academy (USMA) - West Point, NY.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.
In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility distribution systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter ?Notice?) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 4:00 pm on Thursday, February 14, 2008.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government?s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the March-April 2008 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

West Point is located on the west bank of the Hudson River, approximately 50 miles north of New York City and 15 miles south of Newburgh.  In addition to being a college campus with academic, social and athletic activities, West Point is a military installation and a National Historical Landmark, as well as a national tourist attraction with over 3 million tourists annually.

The Major Command is the United States Military Academy.  Today the Corps of Cadets numbers almost 4,000 men and women from every state in the Union as well as several foreign countries and U.S. territories.  

West Point is currently undergoing an extensive Revitalization Program that will greatly improve the quality of cadet life.  West Point gives the impression of being geographically isolated because of the river and mountains that must be crossed to reach communities and services other than those found in the Town of Highlands.
 
As the oldest continually occupied post in our country's history, West Point is home for approximately 1,400 military personnel.  Most military personnel are members of the Academy's staff and faculty and assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 1st Infantry. 

Additional installation information may be located at:  http://www.usma.edu/

<DESC>Description 

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is interested in receiving market information supporting the conversion of Metadata Records from Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) native format to standard MARC 21 format.  The objectives may include but not limited to development of an XSLT1.0 based style sheet that will convert DTIC Native metadata format into a standard Marc 21 format. The style sheet consists of  a set of rules for transforming the document from one format to another. A style sheet is made up of templates, where each template defines a fragment of the output tree as a function of a fragment of the input tree. XSLT uses XPath to refer to nodes in the input tree. Once we have described the transformation rules in a style sheet, we still need a XSLT processor that can run the rules expressed in the style sheet and convert a document in the DTIC native format into the target format. As part of this work we will also provide any required training and any issues arising in the integration of the style sheet into different environments. The planned use of style sheets is in the DTIC OAI framework, and also in a client based transformation solution.  The contractor shall assist in performing functionality and system performance testing in the test and integration development environment before production delivery of the style sheet.

<DESC>Scope of Workfor Architect-Engineer (A/E) ServicesThe VA Medical Center, Fargo, ND is seeking qualified AE firms to perform AE services for Project Number: 437-306; Project Title: Audiology-Eye-Opthalmology 4th Addition.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  A Firm Fixed Price contract is contemplated with a qualified -Small Business- AE firm.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541310, Architectural Services.  The Construction Range for the project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  SCOPE OF SERVICE:  The successful applicant shall be responsible for the coordinated design of an approximately 14,000 gsf of space addition to be added to the Fargo VA Medical Center at the fourth floor level on top of existing Building 46 for audiology, eye and ophthalmology services.Approximately 14,000 gross square feet would be added to the fourth floor of Building 46.  This project design would allow for the centralization of audiology, ENT, optometry, ophthalmology, and tele-retinal clinic into one location with approximately twenty clinical rooms and required support space.  The design shall be based upon the VA space guide, design manuals and input from Fargo VA Medical Center staff.  Elevators 7 & 8 are being extended up to fourth floor under a separate project that has been awarded, but as part of this design, changes may be required, such as a back entrance installed and the associated controls modified, otherwise the doors, entryway, etc shall be modified along with the mechanical space to allow for unrestricted access to the new fourth floor addition since they will be opening into space that is presently part of a mechanical room.  The two existing audiology booths located at first floor shall be relocated to the new addition.  Presently the booths are recessed into the floor so that no ramp is required to enter these booths and that would be the preferred set up on fourth floor.  Other equipment and furnishings for the services shall be relocated or replaced with new under the construction contract as determined during the design process.The space presently occupied by audiology, eye and others shall be remodeled under this project into primary-specialty care space or another function that is better suited for this location as determined during the design process.  Patients who presently need eyeglasses must go to another location on a different floor of the medical center to be fitted for glasses.  This addition should provide the space necessary to fit patients for eyeglasses in the same area where they have their appointments.Two large horizontal duct chases would have to be relocated or raised under this project to provide the necessary space for this addition.  The addition shall have a fully adhered EPDM roofing system, a brick exterior matching the surrounding buildings, new windows matching those recently installed under other projects or matching the existing Building 46 windows as determined during design.  The interior construction shall be steel stud and drywall with finishes similar to other areas in the Medical Center.SELECTION CRITERIA:  The VA will utilize the following selection criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm (including a joint venture or association) with the type of services required.  (2) Specific experience and professional qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team.

<a href="mailto:charles.kollitz@va.gov">Contracting Officer's Email Address</a>
<DESC>Scope of Workfor Architect-Engineer (A/E) ServicesThe VA Medical Center, Fargo, ND is seeking qualified AE firms to perform AE services for Project Number: 437-308; Title: Replacement Operating Rooms.   CONTRACT INFORMATION:  A Firm Fixed Price contract is contemplated with a qualified "Small Business" AE firm.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541310, Architectural Services.  The Construction Range for the project is between $5,000,000 and 10,000,000. SCOPE OF SERVICE:  The successful applicant shall be responsible for the coordinated design of an approximately 40,245 gsf of space to be added to the Fargo VA Medical Center along the west side of existing Building 9.  At a minimum, the design shall involve the relocation of Supply Processing and Distribution (SPD) activities and equipment from the basement level of Building 46 to the new Building 9 addition and it shall construct a new surgical suite with all required support areas at the second floor of the Building 9 addition.  The remaining new addition space shall be a shelled space with concrete floors, unit heaters, sprinklers, minimal lighting and other items determined to be necessary.  New air handling units shall be provided for the SPD and surgical suite spaces.  The design of these areas shall be in accordance with current VA design guides and specifications and current industry standards.  The A/E shall ensure the design process and final design complies with VA Directive 7547, Cultural Resource Management.  The A/E shall in addition, after obtaining Fargo VA approval, submit the design to the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office and obtain their approval.The project will fill in the basement, first, and second floors of the west side of Building 9 to allow for relocation of surgery into space adjacent to the existing recovery rooms on the second floor of Building No. 9.  Basement, first floor and second floor of the in-fill will each be approximately 11,015 gsf.  Third and fourth floors, and the penthouse will be approximately 2,400 gsf each, and constructed to match the existing Building 9 facade so as to maintain the building's original appearance to the extent possible.  The existing west entrance stairs and columns will be salvaged and relocated as part of the effort to maintain the building's original appearance or they shall be replaced with new similar components to maintain the buildings original appearance.  The option choosen shall be dependent upon which option is determined to be the most cost effective during the design process.The second floor of the addition will be constructed into between five and eight replacement operatories as determined during the design process, along with the required support spaces in accordance with Fargo VA staff requests at design meetings, VA space guide and design manual requirements.  Selected surgical equipment as determined during design shall be relocated and reused, while other selected items shall be provided as new.  Select SPD equipment shall be relocated and other equipment provided as new as determined during design.  A clean and soiled dumbwaiter system may be required between the surgical suite and the SPD.  Mechanical and electrical equipment rooms to support the operating room addition may be housed in the basement of the new addition or in the Building 9 fifth floor attic addition.  The third, fourth and fifth (attic) floors construction is necessary to blend the new addition with the appearance of Building No. 9.  The fifth floor attic space is also intended to house any air handling units and other mechanical and electrical equipment necessary to support the shelled in spaces below when they are converted to functional spaces in the future.  Utility chases and equipment planning for both new addition and future renovation of the shelled spaces shall be planned for during the project's initial design.In 1983, when the operating suite was designed, one operating room was designed for orthopedics and the rest were smaller general surgery rooms.  Today larger rooms are required to accommodate equipment and staff for complex procedures so the schedule is many times limited by the availability of the one large orthopedics room.  The Medical Center purchased and installed new endovascular suite equipment in 2008 which shall be relocated to one of the new operating rooms.This project shall provide a new surgical suite that will have modern temperature and humidity controls as part of a new HVAC system, which will alleviate current problems with the current environment of care.  The current surgical suite has an inadequate HVAC system that is being "nursed along" well past its intended life.  Currently, surgeries often have to be delayed or cancelled until the temperature and humidity ranges can be brought within specified surgical suite parameters.  The new ductwork, reheat coils, humidifiers and controls need to provide proper temperature and humidity control.  OR staff need the ability to increase OR room temperatures for cold patients.  If patients become cold, coagulopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, and other intraoperative complications increase.  OR staff also need the ability to decrease the temperature with patients who are hyperthermic due to sepsis, localized infection, or other hypermetabolic conditions.  In order to enhance patient safety, OR staff need to have control over individual room temperatures.  To maintain normothermia for patients, a temperature range of 68 to 75 is recommended (AORN Recommended practices and Guidelines, Standard of Perianesthesia Nursing Practice).Significant patient privacy problems exist with the layout of the existing OR.  The configuration of the rooms is such that patients obtaining an invasive, yet ambulatory procedure must walk through the entire suite, past all of the other operating rooms in order to enter their procedure room.  This violates their privacy and that of other patients at a sensitive time.  It is uncomfortable for them to access needed care in such a manner.  This project shall address this issue and provide for VA staff approved separation between inpatient and outpatient surgical areas within the new operating suite.There are infection control concerns as a result of the inadequate design of the current OR suite.  The soiled laundry and contaminated equipment from the OR must be disposed of outside the main OR suite.  The dirty linens and equipment are carried through a main corridor, and then sent through a dumb waiter to the basement.  This process is both risky and cumbersome.  New energy efficient insulated glass windows (matching those recently installed at other Fargo VA Medical Center locations) will be installed replacing rotting and inefficient, building original, 1945 single pane, divided light, wood double hung windows.  A select number of windows have been replaced and will be replaced under current projects and those windows shall be salvaged and reinstalled along the west side of the new addition.  The new exterior building walls design shall provide significantly more thermal insulation than the existing un-insulated exterior building walls.  The existing original steam perimeter heating system will be removed at rooms adjacent to the construction site.  Energy efficient motors and variable frequency drives shall be used on air handling units and pumps.SELECTION CRITERIA:  The VA will utilize the following selection criteria in descending order of importance:  (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm (including a joint venture or association) with the type of services required.  (2) Specific experience and professional qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together as a team.  (3) Professional capacity of the firm in the designated geographic area of the project to perform work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations.  (Unusually large existing workload that may limit A/E's capacity to perform project work expeditiously).  (4) Past record of performance on contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs or other government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  (5) Demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.  PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:  The successful applicant must be geographically located within a 50 mile radius of the Fargo VA Medical Center.   	SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  All responding firms, including consultants to the primary firm are required to submit one completed original and 3 copies of Standard Form 330 Architect-Engineer Qualifications.  Submit required documents no later than 4:30pm, Central Standard Time, May 16, 2008 to the Issuing Office address shown above.  Scheduled Oral Presentations will follow.  Responding firms, either multi-disciplined or collaborating with consultants, must demonstrate capability in healthcare architecture, interior design, surveying, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, communications, environmental, fire protection, cost estimating, specification writing, and construction surveillance skills as described herein.

An Initiative is defined as a new or existing technology, system, or TTP that satisfies an operational requirement to satisfy Information, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) related capability gaps.      
The Empire Challenge experimentation series is the premier ISR experiment event directed by the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)).  There are four major principals who support the USD(I) US Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), and National Geospatial Agency (NGA).  In addition, Coalition and NATO participants are also extensively involved to ensure interoperability and exposure to these Initiatives.  USJFCOM J2/JTC-I will lead the coordination and execution of EC09.    
The primary focus of EC09 is to identify new Technologies/Systems/TTPs that will satisfy Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) for ISR Transformation as well as Command and Control of ISR assets involved.  In addition, Combatant Command (COCOM) Challenges, Joint Urgent Operations Needs (JUONs), and Joint Priority Lists (JPLs) are also key considerations.  
Empire Challenge experiment results are incorporated into a final report used to develop a Military Utility Assessment (MUA) addressing Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) implications of the Initiatives evaluated in the experiment.  This report will be published by generated and published by the Naval Postgraduate School and provided to the Empire Challenge Executive Steering Group (ESG) for consideration and acquisition recommendations to the Services and Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC).  
Empire Challenge Risk Reduction Limited Objective Experiments are performed to insure that no system/technology is installed on an operational or experimental network without it first being tested for technical and integration performance and assessed for risk in an operationally representative laboratory setting.

<DESC>The Joint Tactical Edge Network (JTEN) NetOps Interoperability Working group, in coordination with Office of the Secretary of Defense Department of Development Research & Engineering (OSD DDR&E), will be hosting a Request for Information session on Network Management Interoperability on May 28-29, 2008 at the Holiday Inn, Tinton Falls, NJ.  The objective is to identify what information needs to be shared, but also investigate a common way of transferring this information between different Network Management Systems operating in a Service or Joint network.  We need to determine how to share this information effectively between different systems. The results of this workshop will be considered for submission to standards bodies.<BR><BR>This opportunity will allow for different DoD Services, Industry and Academic Institutions to come together and discuss possible standards and implementations to Network Management, allowing for an overall improvement in NetOps. This workshop provides an excellent opportunity to understand common challenges in this area.  We expect an open and interactive dialogue focused at identifying common challenges in bringing networks together and employment of interoperable Network Management Systems.<BR><BR>All Industry and Academic Institutions interested in attending the Joint Network Management Science and Technology Workshop shall respond by completing the attached Attendance Request.  Space is limited therefore not everyone who submits an Attendance Request will receive a formal invitation to attend. The Government is restricting attendance to two individuals per organization. If you would like to present, a draft brief should be submitted as well.  Responses should be submitted by May 5, 2008 to both Kim Jakubowski and Yogeeta Kumar (contact information is below).

<DESC>The Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO) is seeking a light weight replacement for the current heavy steel Ballistic Protection System (BPS) currently used on its rotary wing aircraft.  As a result TAPO has the requirement to conduct a live fire on readily available aircraft armor panels (ballistic protection).  These systems should encompass the gamut of light weight ballistic protection to meet the objective and threshold requirements below.  Those firms who would like to participate in these live fire tests are invited to provide two 1 x 1 (1 square foot panels) at no cost to the government for the governments use in the tests.  Ballistic performance tests will be carried out using the following criteria:

	Range/Obliquity :  
	Threshold:	300 meters from muzzle and zero obliquity (300m, 0 Deg)
	Objective:	100 meters from muzzle and zero obliquity (100m, 0 Deg)

	Ballistic Protection
	Threshold:	7.62mm x M1943 ball
	Objective:	5.45mm x 39 Full Metal Jacket Type PS 

	Repeatability
	Threshold:	2 rounds within a 3 diameter 
	Objective:	2 rounds within a 1 diameter


The armor should be in its deployable state (i.e. have any and all coatings typically used when in normal operation in a combat environment).  Firms will only be provided the results from their own ballistic panels test event and will not have access to the another firms results.  This is a Government only test event and participating firms cannot witness the test. 

Additionally the Government requests the written composition of the armor panel to determine if any material or environmental concerns exist.  These details will be maintained by the Government and will not be shared with other firms.

The Government conducted live fire test is anticipated to occur in early July 08.  As a result each firms panels must be delivered no later than 23 June 08.  

TAPO Technical POC for this action is Sean Heatherman, Aerospace Engineer, (757) 878-3299 ext 266

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, (VA) Cleveland Business Center located at 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, OH 44141 plans to issue a design/build contract to procure a wind turbine system. This Sources Sought Notice is seeking to identify suppliers, or Contractors capable to provide all labor, materials, tools and equipment, and design-build services necessary for a wind energy system. The VA plans to procure this requirement using source selection procedures and the award will be based on the best value to the Government considering price and non-price factors. Any resulting contract will be firm-fixed priced; NAICS Code: 541330 with a size standard of $4,500,000. This requirement will include the equipment selection, permitting, bonding, construction, and commissioning of a wind energy system.  The Davis-Bacon Act will apply.  The magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.PROJECT INFORMATION: Design and Construct a wind energy system at VA Medical Center at 4801 Veterans Dr. in St. Cloud, MN.  The VA is interested in owning a single large wind turbine between approximately 300 kW and 750 kW in rated capacity, with a preference for a system of about 500 kW.   The system is expected to operate on the customer side of the meter, but allow for exporting power to the electric utility, Xcel Energy.  The VA will consider both new and rebuilt wind turbines with minimum two year warrantees (proposers may submit varying warrantee options).  The contractor will assist the VA with the following four activities:"	Anemometry  - install a 60 meter meteorological tower to collect data at several elevations,"	General development assistance, including turbine and tower selection, specific location selection local permitting, and electrical interconnection,"	Construction of the wind energy system, being responsible for successfully constructing the turbine, tower, foundation, balance of plant and commissioning of the wind energy system, and"	Ongoing operations and maintenance as an option.  If the contractor does not wish to conduct operations and maintenance, the contractor will assist the VA with obtaining contracted O&M services.  Respondents may offer several alternatives based on wind energy system options, and allowing for cost differences in construction and balance of plant for those systems, while meeting the requirements of the scope of work.  Contractors will provide all labor, material, permits, supplies and equipment to  furnish, install, and commission the wind energy system; including all necessary devices and connections between the wind turbine and main electrical service.  If the proposal response offers options for wind turbines, price differentials should be clearly noted.  The St. Cloud Site was evaluated in November 2007.  For ease of reference, respondents may assume the following site characteristics:Characteristics	FactorWind speed @ 80 meters	7.1 meters per secondWind shear coefficient	0.3979Site elevation	1,055 feetWeibull Shape Factor	2.0Turbulence Intensity (TI)	15 percentSystem design and equipment specifications shall minimize maintenance requirements.  System shall include metering with SCADA for remote data collection, turbine control, and soft fault clearing. The contractor shall work with the VA to integrate the SCADA system with the VA's information technology or provide alternatives for the VA to collect performance data. The system shall be capable of providing 3-phase power at interconnection voltage (480V or 13.8 kV on the customer side of the meter).   SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:Please provide the following information in your response:1.	What type of work has your company performed in the past in support of the same or similar requirement?2.	Can or has your company managed a project of this nature before?3.	Was it managed under an ISO (or similar type) controlled environment?4.	Has your company managed a team of subcontractors before?5.

This RFI is issued to determine the capability of prospective contractors to provide comprehensive HSI services. These services include expertise in the HSI, human performance, concept mapping, and systems engineering.<br />BACKGROUND: The Air Force requires a tool to assess Air Force weapons systems in requirements, acquisition, and sustainment as a method for saving the Air Force significant costs during the life cycle of systems while optimizing total system performance. A sound HSI assessment strategy puts the warfighter at the center of the Integrated Defense Acquisition, Technology, &amp; Logistics Life Cycle Management Framework; thus, equipping the warfighter rather than manning the equipment. Early application of HSI leads to cost avoidance in terms of manpower, personnel, training, and human error. To achieve this requirement, the Air Force seeks business and industry familiar with DoD, application of HSI, and/or concept mapping. <br />SCOPE: This request for information is directed to highly competitive potential prime contractors who can demonstrate the capability to provide HSI knowledge and experience and understand how the application of concept mapping benefits the requirements, acquisition, and sustainment processes while affecting total life cycle costs in the requirements, design, development, integration, fielding, and sustainment of weapons systems programs. <br />The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine the requirements and acquisition strategy for the following tasks:<br />Generate weapons systems concept maps for the HSI Assessment Tool (AT) so that Human Performance assessments can be accomplished through application of the HSI process regardless of acquisition phase.<br />Provide system analyst and/or operational research expertise, more than five years experience, in DoD weapons systems management to include: systems analysis of DoD and / or Air Force weapons systems, an understanding of the Integrated Defense Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Life Cycle Management Framework, weapons systems WBS, and weapons systems tech data.<br />DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The Information package should include the following items:<br />1. Do you qualify under the 8(a) program? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBzone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business or veteran-owned small business)?<br />2. What are your applicable NAICS codes?<br />3. Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of work? If not, why?<br />4. Do you have sufficient experience in the anticipated scope that would allow the evaluator to assess your capability? If not, please explain.<br />5.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Mechanical Pencils by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Pencil, Mechanical
7520-00-NIB-1905 - .5 mm, 6 Asst. Translucent Barrel Colors, Latex-free grip and eraser
7520-00-NIB-1906 - .7mm, 6 Asst. Translucent Barrel Colors, Latex-free grip and eraser
7520-00-NIB-1924 - .5mm, Side Advanced, Latex-free grip and eraser, Translucent Smoke Barrel

7520-00-NIB-1981 - .7mm, Stainless Steel, Antimicrobial Latex-free grip and eraser, Silver with Black accents and grip

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Mechanical Pencils to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Stock numbers for similar products are:

BIC Atlantis Mechanical Pencil, 0.5mm - BIC-MPAFG11-BK
BIC Atlantis Mechanical Pencil, 0.7mm  BIC-MPAG11-BK; BIC-MPAG21; BIC-MPAGP41; 
BIC Velocity Mechanical Pencil, 0.5mm - BIC-MV511-BK; BIC-MV711-BK; BIC-MV7P51-BK

Pentel EnerGize Mechanical Pencil Trim, 0.7 mm - PEN-PL77A; PEN-PL77S
Pentel EnerGize Deluxe Automatic Pencil, 0.7mm - PEN-PL77BP


In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Mechanical Pencils to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 14, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) is considering incorporating the following Quality Assurance Criteria in its solicitation and subsequent contract for radiological analyses.  Comments are being requested concerning feasibility and difficulty in meeting these criteria.  This RFI is part of the Market Research that is being conducted prior to the announcement of the RFP.
Acronyms:LCS - Laboratory Control Sample.MS - Matrix SpikessLC - sample specific Critical LevelssMDC - sample specific Minimum Detectable ConcentrationCSU - Combined Standard Uncertainty
QA Criteria - For the specifications provided below, no action is to be taken for a single occurrence but action is to be taken when a parameter specification has been exceeded three times in a single batch of samples (17 samples) or when trending indicates that a parameter specification has been exceeded more than 5% in 30 consecutive days.  Exceptions to this application are noted for certain parameters.1.  Chemical yields shall be between 60-110%; the yield shall be less than 100% plus 2 times the standard uncertainty of the yield with a 110% upper bound limit.2.  Recoveries for both LCSs and MSs shall be between 80-110%; the recovery shall be less than 100% plus result plus 2 times the standard uncertainty of the recovery with a 110% upper bound limit.3.  A blank result shall not exceed the ssLC of the analysis.4.  Negative results shall not exceed 1.65 times the CSU of the result.5.  For duplicate samples, the difference between results shall be < 2 times the square root of the sum of each CSU squared.  The warning range is between 2 and 3 times the square root of the sum of each CSU squared.  A difference between results that is > 3 times the square root of the sum of each CSU squared is unacceptable with no exception.6.  The ssMDC for a measurement should be less than the contractual MDC.7.  The ssLC should be approximately  of the ssMDC.8.  The ssLC should be approximately two times the CSU when a result is negative.9.  The ssLC should be approximately two times the CSU when a positive result is less than two times the CSU.10.  The CSU of the result should be approximately 1/3 of the ssMDC when the result is below the ssMDC.11.  When a result is greater than five times the ssMDC, the CSU of the result should be greater than the ssMDC.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts- (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 315211 assigned to contract number (Determined at Award).[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

1.	Twelve (12) DMDs on controller boards are required that shall each include a 1024 x 768 array of aluminum micromirrors packaged in an integrated circuit with a window to protect the tiny mirrors and allow users to supply their own light source.
2.	Eight (8) DMD chip sets are required, each including one DMD.  These DMDs shall have identical specifications to the DMDs that are on the controller boards, but shall not include the controller board.
3.	Twelve (12) ALP electronics boards are required that interface with the DMDs on the controller boards.
4.	Each DMD array shall measure 0.7 inches along its diagonal.
5.	Each DMD that is mounted on a controller board shall be capable of being removed from the controller board and replaced by any of the other DMDs required here.
6.	The DMD mirrors shall be on a 13.68 micrometer pitch along both directions in the array.
7.	Each DMD mirror shall be individually electronically addressed and made to tilt relative to its powered off state.  Upon power-up, there are to be two states for each mirror: +12 degrees and 12 degrees.  These angles are with respect to the window normal, and they are about an axis that is along the diagonal of the mirrors.
8.	For each DMD on controller board, the associated computer-interfaced electronic controller board shall enable a binary file to be loaded into the DMD array which specifies, at any given time, which mirrors are in the plus 12 degrees state and which are in the negative 12 degrees state, thereby defining a DMD binary image.
9.	The switching time for any given DMD mirror shall be less than 20 microseconds.
10.	100 percent of the DMD mirrors shall be operational.
11.	The optical fill factor shall be at least 85 percent.

The cited authority is applicable because MBF Bioscience is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  LNG has been using the Stereo Investigator system developed by MBF Bioscience from our collaborators at the Johns Hopkins University to quantify the cell loss in our new Parkinsons disease mouse models.  It will greatly facilitate our research if we have an in-house stereology setup.  Because we have already generated substantial amount of data using the Stereo Investigator system developed by MBF Bioscience, we would like to continue to use the same system for the rest of experiments.  In addition, we have learned how to use this system and will save time from learning a different setup.  Therefore, we believe the Stereo Investigator system developed by MBF Bioscience will be critical to keep our data consistent and better fits our need.  The delivery date is 60 days ARO.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price technically acceptable.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)
Computing Services (CS) datacenters provide routine and mission-critical
computer processing resources and support to numerous government agencies on a
fee-for-service basis, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">DISA sites are access-controlled and monitored
to provide operational and mission security for customer programs and
equipment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Changes in operational
requirements, on-going and changing security concerns and regulations, DISA
transformation initiatives, and aging systems all require that DISA continue to
invest in maintaining modern, operational, secure intrusion detection systems
at its facilities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ongoing preventative
and repair maintenance programs are essential to systems that are reliable and
operate as designed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Modifications to
the existing system may be required when operations dictate such, when
equipment becomes outdated or obsolete, and when software systems are required
by technology improvements or planned obsolescence of systems.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maintaining security systems that meet &amp;
exceed changing DISA security requirements is a challenge met by this
agreement.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The foundation of every good security system is
intrusion detection.<span>&nbsp; </span>24/7 monitored
protection against unauthorized entry, access, and other penetrations of
perimeter and internal security measures must be monitored and recorded for an
accurate audit trail.<span>&nbsp; </span>DISA does not have
the organic systems or manpower to install, maintain, and monitor the IDS to
the required security standards, and so DISA SMC Ogden has outsourced this
service.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

necessary in maintaining the existing system.</span></p>

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.
 
  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<CONTACT>Timothy DW McLendon, Phone (703) 292-4268, Email tmclendo@nsf.gov - 
<DESC>Vendors have submitted the following questions and below are NSF's answers to those questions.

1. Can NSF please provide submission instructions?  Is PDF electronic submission acceptable? <<Tim, can you handle this one?>>

2. Are there any page limitations for the proposal response? <<No>>

3. Will the proposed solution be required to run on multiple browsers i.e. Mozilla, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera Safari and others? <<NSF requires that the application be able to run at minimum on Internet Explorer and Mozilla FireFox.  The ability to run the application on other browsers is considered a plus.>>

4. Can NSF provide guidance on when the solution needs to be live in production? <<Per the RFP, All of these requirements must be met by the offerer at the time of award.  Our intent here is that the  contractor should already have a system that meets our requirements available at the time of the bid.  We need the NSF version of their system be in full production immediately upon award which ideally will be sometime in May 2008 should there be a successful bidder.   We are looking for an off-the-shelf solution that is customizable to the needs of NSF.   It is not our intention to build a system from ground up. >> Can NSF also provide tentative timelines for execution of the options I through V. <<Options I-IV are dependent on another internal application and we have no funding in FY 08 for implementing these enhancements.  There also is no immediate timeline for Option V although we would want to be able to provide this information within a reasonable amount of time upon request by our senior management.  Our intent here is the bidder be able to demonstrate that it has the expertise and resources to further customize and enhance the solution to meet needs that we anticipate pursuing sometime in the not too far off future.>>

5. Can NSF please clarify your definition of the term "turnkey" as indicated in SectionV of the proposal?   <<Turnkey:  Built and ready to operate with some minor customization>>

6. Can NSF provide details of the integration capabilities with SATO Travel?  <<The successful bidder must be able to interface with SATO to get the information that it needs to meet the reporting requirements detailed in our RFP.  It is up to the successful bidder to work with SATO to determine the requirements of a SATO integration that will meet our reporting needs.  In addition, the bidder must be able to provide near real-time tracking of flights.  This involves not only integration with SATO but integration with other government and airline systems which the bidder should investigate and provide as part of its solution.>>

7. Can NSF provide some usage trends - e.g. peak activity hours during the day, peak months etc.  <<The heaviest usage of the system will be between the hours of 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM EST; although we anticipate that some users will access the system around the clock.>>

8. In section III.1 General Requirements it states that All of these requirements must be met by the offerer at time of award. Is it NSFs expectation that the offerer will have a pre-existing seamless interface with SatoTravel at time of award?  <<Yes>>


THE DIVISION OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXCEED THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUITSTION THRESHOLD OF $100,000.00.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of
Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity
which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the
Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 	(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the water treatment and distribution system and the wastewater collection and treatment system at the United States Army Garrison - West Point, New York.  Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.

In conjunction with the conveyance of the systems, the Contractor will be required to provide utility services, including improvements, upgrades, repairs, expansions, investments, and plant replacement, as well as continued operation and maintenance of the utility systems.  Additionally, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the conveyed systems.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C.  2688  Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area, and satisfy the requirements of the contract.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C.  2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately.

Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the resultant contract.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the solicitation.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.  All other than small businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.


Installation Description:  The U.S. Army Garrison, West Point, New York, (West Point) is located on approximately 16,000 acres on the West Bank of the Hudson River, roughly 50 miles north of New York City and 15 miles south of Newburgh, New York.  Since 1802 when President Jefferson signed legislation establishing the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, USMA has produced graduates who have contributed to our country in peace and war.

The purpose of USMA is to provide the Nation with leaders of character who serve the common defense.  The Mission of USMA is To educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country; professional growth throughout a career as an officer in the United States Army; and a lifetime of selfless service to the nation.

Today, the Corps of Cadets includes over 4,300 men and women from every state in the Union as well as several foreign countries and U.S. Territories.  In addition to the Corp of Cadets, the West Point community also includes approximately 8,000 officers, enlisted and civilian staff and faculty members (and their families) whose primary duty is the education and training of the cadets.

West Point was officially recognized for its historical significance and contributions to the country in 1960 when this rocky highland was declared a National Historical Landmark.  It is estimated that almost 3 million tourists from around the world visit West Point every year to walk the grounds and, observe the cadets and enjoy the day along the banks of the Hudson River.

Additional installation information may be located at:  http://www.usma.edu/

Utility Systems to be privatized:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the systems.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations:

Water Treatment and Distribution System

West Points potable water utility system includes several subsystems, which serve the following areas: the Main Post area, the Camp Buckner / Camp Natural Bridge areas, Round Pond Recreation Area, Constitution Island, Lake Frederick, Bull Pond, and Morgan Farms.

The subsystems located at the Round Pond Recreation Area, Constitution Island, Lake Frederick, Bull Pond and Morgan Farms are small subsystems typically consisting of a ground water well and a small amount of water line.  These subsystems are included in this privatization action.

There are also a number of small systems located at various ranges in which potable water is trucked-in.  These range systems are not included in this privatization action.

<DESC>This proposal is for the addition of NSNs to the Corporate Contract between DLA and Oshkosh Truck Corporation SP075002D9720.  This project was initiated to ensure coverage on the provided list of NSNs for Air Conditioning Parts on Tactical Wheeled Vehicles, identified from the DSCC AC Summit by Land DCO and the military.  The contract is a long-term contract, currently in its 6th option year with 1 full option year remaining. The 54 NSNs are intended to be added under the same terms and conditions as the original solicitation.  All NSNs are available through the primary point of contact, Veronica Godbott at veronica.godbott@dla.mil.  Items will be procured as ?All or None? per NSN.  There is a potential to add other center items at a later date.  All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.  See Note(s): 12 and 26.    Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.   This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not posses complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Approved sources are: Oshkosh Truck.  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors described in the solicitation.  NSNs to be covered under this project include:2540014937841	5310013543729	5340015302603	5340015323710

<DESC>FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE US DOE/NNSA IN THE DELIVERY OF 
WIND ENERGY TO FEDERAL FACILITITES IN ALBUQUERQUE, NM

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT POSTING AGENT D. V. ROSEBOROUGH.   ANY QUESTIONS AND ALL RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL TO MELLIE R. CANNADY, SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES, CONTRACTING REPRESENTATIVE AT EMAIL ADDRESS: MRCANNA@SANDIA.GOV.  PHONE INQUIRIES CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED.

Purpose:  Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) to commercial, utility-scale wind farm developers, owners, operators, energy service companies (ESCOs) and financiers who may be interested in forming partnerships with the US DOE/NNSA in the delivery of wind energy to Federal facilities in Albuquerque, NM.
  
This RFI is part of a comprehensive strategy to meet and exceed statutory renewable energy goals for federal agencies; DOE/NNSA is taking a leadership position in accelerating the development of utility-scale wind projects at DOE/NNSA sites that have adequate land with wind resources in Class 3-7 regimes and transmission/distribution capacity.  This RFI seeks responses to issues identified prior to the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the siting, design, installation, operation and maintenance, and delivery of electrical energy of wind farms at an Albuquerque site.  Industry will also have the opportunity to engage in discussions with Sandia prior to this RFIs response deadline.

DOE/NNSA has conducted an initial screening of all DOE/NNSA facilities and a site at Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque is one of the areas identified as having the greatest wind farm potential by these initial screening criteria.

DOE/NNSA seeks to facilitate wind farm development and implementation by installing a meteorological (MET) tower for at least 12 months at the potential wind farm site on available land.  Subsequent steps will involve the installation of commercial utility-scale wind turbines at one or more sites.   The wind farm(s) may also serve as a blueprint for other federal agencies seeking to meet EPActs renewable energy goals and become a showcase to educate the U.S. public on commercial, utility-scale wind technology.

Background:  Recent legislative policy, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), and Executive Order 13423 Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management, and DOE/NNSA Order 430.2B Departmental Energy, Renewable Energy, and Transportation Management have provided impetus for DOE/NNSA to fully assess its own potential to reduce energy consumption and increase the amount of directly-consumed energy from renewable energy resources.  The DOE/NNSA objective is to take a leadership position in meeting the federal renewable energy goals set forth in the EPAct 2005 more quickly than required by law.  Double credit will be given for renewable energy produced on agency sites or on Federal lands and used at a Federal facility; or for renewable energy produced on Native American lands.  Given the costs of available renewable energy technologies and renewable energy resources on DOE/NNSA lands, it is anticipated that utility-scale wind energy may provide the most cost effective approach for DOE/NNSA to meet a significant portion of the EPAct 2005s renewable energy goal.

SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES / KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE / DOE/NNSA AS A WHOLESALE ELECTRIC CUSTOMER

DOE/NNSA is primarily interested in on-site renewable projects that will be privately owned and operated, with the DOE/NNSA site purchasing the energy through a power purchase agreement (PPA). The Department will consider other project arrangements and is seeking input on approaches to structuring agreements. DOE/NNSA is also in the process of exploring and implementing Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC) at most large DOE/NNSA sites. Energy service companies (ESCOs) have been encouraged to evaluate renewables for the proposed ESPC projects. 

As a wholesale electric customer, it is typical to purchase, schedule, take delivery, and to use the spot market for over- and under-utilization of scheduled deliveries.  It is expected that a power block will be competitively purchased of size substantially below the peak demand of the site (72 MW in 2007).  An additional summer block is also expected to be procured with additional small power purchases to meet peaking needs through a Merchant Desk.  Purchasing strategies involve balancing cost while ensuring power is always available to meet the load and power Purchases are based on forecasts and real-time metering.  Excess power can be sold at expected reduced market rates. It is preferred that the wind energy be firmed by the developer.  However, other options may be considered and an interface may exist in the forecasting function between wind production and load variability.  

It is anticipated that the energy produced by wind turbines will not exceed the consumption of the federal wholesale customers.  Thus a nominal installation size of 30 MW of wind turbines is expected without consideration of additional energy customers outside of this transaction.      

Issues of consideration:  Sandia seeks to solicit industry input regarding the type of information, data, conditions, resources, contracting mechanisms or parameters, etc. that potential industrial partners would expect/require to be in place in order to respond to a RFP for a wind farm(s) installation and operation on Federal land.  The following issues may be addressed or commented on by the developer responding to the RFI, or may be addressed in the future by the Federal entities involved as wholesale customers, or will be deferred until such time as can be addressed in a future RFP.  Please address these issues with comments on the requirements, needs, or expectations for a successful wind farm installation.   

	Sandia will install a 50 meter MET tower and a comprehensive wind data set will be made available to all parties interested in the RFP.
	Sandia will consider requests by interested parties to allow approvals for siting of bidder-supplied MET towers for additional wind assessment.
	What additional information would a bidder require regarding the wind resource at a particular DOE/NNSA site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site?
	Maps of electrical plot plans will be made available at the industry day. (see below)  What other information would a bidder need regarding electrical transmission and distribution at the site to be able to respond to an RFP for a wind farm at that site? 
	Interconnect approval will obviously be necessary for any turbines.  What other information would a bidder need regarding permission for transmission or distribution systems interconnection?  
	What type(s) of contracting mechanism(s) and terms would a bidder envision in 	   contracting with DOE/NNSA for wind farms at DOE/NNSA sites?  Potential contracting mechanisms for federal agencies include: 
o	Energy Savings Performance Contract 
o	Enhanced Use Lease
o	Power Purchase Agreement 
o	Power Brokering Agreement (see Attachment)
o	Renewable Energy Credits in exchange for lease and royalty payments
o	Other contracting arrangement of interest?
	What length of contract would a bidder envision for a viable wind farm project?
	How would the type of contract affect desired length of contract?
	What is a reasonable time frame for a bidder to develop and implement a wind farm project?
	Comment on land use issues and the value to be received for land use in return for the energy to be purchased.
	Comment on Environmental Assessment (EA), Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requirements and/or processes.  
	Comment on tax incentives and Renewable Energy Credit (RECs) and the ownership structure needed in terms of contracts to maximize benefits of such incentives.  

Issues of land use will include the rules and regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), coordination needed to avoid possible mission conflict due to other activities on the land or nearby, developers approach to contracting activities on base such as project management, safety oversight, escorts, QA inspections, etc.  Nonetheless, Sandia wants to move forward on wind farm development and interact with industry to pro-actively work through issues to achieve satisfactory resolution in a reasonable time frame.  

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST

The purpose of this notice is to obtain from potential industry participants:

1.	An indication of the level of interest  
2.	Suggestions for inclusion in the RFP to attract potential bidders
3.	Types of development planning and support that would be most useful.
4.	Comments on how best to solicit and form partnerships, and how project costs, roles and responsibilities should be shared to best achieve success (e.g., for site development, construction, infrastructure, commissioning, power purchase agreements, operation, decommissioning, and contract terms).
5.	Comments on the issues of consideration.    

All responses will be held in confidence within the Sandia, Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), and DOE/NNSA team.  Industry recommendations on questions and comments in this RFI will be used to formulate a subsequent solicitation plan, such as an RFP.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in any future solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving future notification of related activities, if desired.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals.  *** This is not a request for proposals. ***

Submission of information of an expression of interest DOE/NNSA does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal to any subsequent solicitation.  DOE/NNSA will use the information to implement its renewable energy effort and incorporate suggestions in future solicitation or other procurement documents where appropriate.

Respondents wishing to protect specific information and data from unauthorized disclosure should mark such information as "Limited Rights Data," or "Restricted Computer Software," as defined in FAR 52.227-14 - Rights in Data - General.  Sandia has found that it cannot assure protection of Supplier data information if it is only marked as "Proprietary".

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<BR><BR>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<BR><BR>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 under Instructions for Completing the Questionnaire, below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<BR><BR>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Governments rights in the data.<BR><BR>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS.<BR><BR>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<BR><BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<BR><BR>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Market Survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this Market Survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<BR><BR>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<BR><BR>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy US Army requirements for a Full Width Mine Plow (FWMP), Lane Marking System (LMS) and Combat Dozer Blade (CDB) mountable on the Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV). The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<BR><BR>The ABV is based on the M1A1 Abrams tank chassis with a fabricated turret unique to the ABV. The ABV has two Mine Clearing Line Charges (MICLIC), a FWMP, a CDB and a LMS. The Government would provide a M1A1 Abrams tank for the testing of a proposed FWMP, LMS and CDB. The ABV must create a cleared and marked lane that is 15 feet wide and 14 inches deep (objective); 13 feet wide and 10 inches deep (threshold) through minefields 200 meters long consisting of Anti-personnel (AP) and Anti-tank (AT) mines. The ABV is required to clear and mark the lane in 6.5 minutes (objective); 8 minutes (threshold). The ABV must also be capable of clearing complex obstacles to enable passage of the maneuver element through the breach. The soil is assumed to be unfrozen with no rocks larger than 32 centimeters in diameter. The threshold is to plow the described width and depth in loose sand and soft silt (objective: hard clay and hard silt). The ABV must also have the capability to breach the following non-explosive simple obstacles with a CDB: 1.52 meter concrete cube (threshold), urban rubble (threshold), log post obstacle (threshold), log crib (objective), abatis (objective).<BR><BR>The FWMP and CDB assemblies must be detachable within 10 minutes (threshold); 5 minutes (objective), from inside the crew compartment using Basic Issue Items and on-board equipment. The FWMP and CDB assemblies must also have a travel-lockout to hold and lock the blade in its stowed position during vehicle travel. The ABV with the FWMP installed must be capable of traversing a 15 degree ramp when loading and unloading from an amphibious ship and traverse from that ramp onto a Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), or other vessel, without dunnage, and without damage to the ramp or vessel. The ABV has a comparable capability to the M1A1 Abrams to climb vertical walls, cross trenches, climb up 60 percent grade slopes and negotiate a 40 percent side slope. When combat-loaded, the ABV will weigh less than 60 tons (objective); less than 70 tons (threshold). These weights include having the FWMP, CDB and LMS installed on the M1A1 Abrams tank.<BR><BR>The ABV FWMP must provide survivability against explosive blasts and complete the mission. It must survive the equivalent of two Iranian M-19 Anti-Tank Mine detonations on its FWMP and still complete the mission attempt of clearing one lane thru the mine field to the standard listed above.<BR><BR>The ABV LMS must be capable of using marking poles currently in US Army inventory, NSN 6230-99-791-5361. The ABV lane markers will denote the edge(s) of the cleared lane up to 300 meters in length, in day, night, and combat conditions. The LMS must be capable of operation by a two man crew in the closed hatch configuration.<BR><BR><BR>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE:<BR><BR>1. Number each response with the appropriate question number.<BR><BR>2. You do not have to repeat the question in your response. <BR><BR>3. If you cannot answer a question, please indicate No Response.<BR><BR>4. If a response will satisfy another question, state: See response to question XXX.<BR><BR>5. Include relevant sales media and product manuals. If providing an ACROBAT formatted manual, annotate the manual to indicate which material is applicable to the questions. If preferred, include Internet Web links to locations where animations/videos may be viewed.<BR><BR>6. If your sales media and/or manuals contain a restricted distribution statement, issue a release statement indicating that the restricted material may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market investigation.<BR><BR>7. Spell out any acronyms in their first instance.<BR><BR>8. Clearly mark any proprietary information. If applicable, the front page of your response package should state: Proprietary Information Contained. Provide a release statement indicating that the proprietary information may be distributed to Army personnel involved with this market investigation.<BR><BR>9. A copy of the Tri-Lateral Design and Testing Code (TDTC) is available on the Internet at http://www.dtic.mil/dticasd/sbir/sbir032/a213.pdf.<BR><BR>10..

<AWARDEE>SEE DESCRIPTION
<DESC>Award of the ENCORE II Information Technology (IT) Solutions contracts has been made under the Small Business Set-Aside Category.  The award decision was made based on a Best Value analysis of each offerors Past Performance, Technical/Management Approach and Cost/Price.  For this evaluation, Past Performance is comparatively equal to Technical/Management approach.  When combined, Past Performance and Technical/Management approach are significantly more important than Cost Price.  

Following are the contractors who were awarded a contract, and the Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) that was determined for each contractor:

Award date is 24 April 2008, with performance starting on 1 June 2008.  The period of performance consists of a 5-year base period and 5 one-year option periods.  Contract ceiling is $12.225 Billion.

The proposals submitted under the Full and Open category are still under evaluation.

ENCORE II will establish multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) task order type contracts capable of providing global net-centric capabilities, attributes or services that support the military services, the DoD and other Federal agencies. The ENCORE II contracts will provide net-centric solutions, including network engineering, analysis and support for the acquisition, installation, fielding, training, operation and life-cycle management of components and systems in the operational environments of Combatant Commands and their subordinate components, the military services, the Department of Defense and other agencies of Federal government.  This includes procurement of various products, including but not limited to, hardware, software and licenses, as applicable, when such products are incidental to the implementation of the solution, through separate task orders to satisfy IT activities at all operating levels. Areas to be supported by the contracts include Command and Control (C2), Intelligence and Mission Support Areas and to all elements of the Global Information Grid (GIG). Tasks performed under the ENCORE II contracts will include enterprise IT policy and planning, integrated solutions management, performance benchmarking, business process reengineering, requirement analysis, market research and prototyping, information and knowledge engineering, custom application development, product integration, test and evaluation, asset management, communications engineering, security engineering certification and accreditation, telecommunications support, computer-telephony integration, web services, hardware and equipment, software applications and licenses and managed services.
