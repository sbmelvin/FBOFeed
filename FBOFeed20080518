Each motor shall be provided with a corrosion-resistant nameplate giving the name of the manufacturer, horsepower, voltage, frequency, speed, efficiency and current for unit at full load.<BR><BR>8.0	DISCHARGE HEAD ASSEMBLY<BR><BR>Discharge head shall be a cast iron surface discharge with 125 lb. ANSI dimension discharge flange and shall support the motor, column, shafting and pump assembly. The discharge head shall be mounted on a fabricated steel,-sole plate which shall be anchored to the existing pump sleeve/mounting plate.  The bolt pattern of the discharge head assembly shall utilize the existing bolt holes shown on the attached drawing or be located in an area that does not interfere with existing holes.  Holes can be drilled and tapped in the sleeve in order to mount the new discharge head assembly. The bottom surface of the head shall be machined smooth. A tapped drain line connection shall be provided for the removal of the excess water to a drain. <BR><BR>A cast iron stuffing box shall be provided with a bronze removable stuffing box bushing, galvanized split gland, T-bolts with stainless steel clips and brass nuts. Stuffing box shall utilize a minimum of five synthetic Garlock 8913 packing rings, compressed around the pump shaft and lubricated by the pumped water.<BR><BR><BR><BR>9.0	COLUMN ASSEMBLY<BR><BR>Column pipe shall be furnished in interchangeable sections not over 10 feet in length and shall be connected with threaded sleeve type couplings. The friction loss in the column shall not exceed 5 feet per 100 feet of column, based on the rated capacity of the pump. The weight and size of the column shall be no less than required in AWWA spec E101-1. The line shafting shall be AISI 300 series or 416 stainless steel of ample size, minimum of 1 inch diameter, to operate the pump without distortion or vibration. The shaft shall be furnished in interchangeable sections not more than 10 feet in length and shall be coupled with AISI 300 or 400 series stainless steel coupling. The column assembly shall have bronze bearing retainers retained by the butted pipe ends. Each bearing retainer shall contain a water-lubricated, cutless rubber bearing designed for vertical turbine pump service.<BR><BR>10.0	PUMP BOWL ASSEMBLY<BR><BR>The pump bowls shall be of close grained cast iron, having a minimum tensile strength of 30,000 pounds per square inch, free from blow holes, sand holes, and all other faults; accurately machined and fitted to close dimensions. Bowls are to be coated inside with a smooth vitreous enamel to reduce friction losses, corrosion, and sand wear. Each intermediate bowl is to be constructed by using a bronze bearing and a neoprene bearing to support the impeller shaft.<BR><BR>The bowl is to provide a side seal at the impeller skirt and in addition, a resilient neoprene ring, reinforced with an imbedded steel core, is to be installed in the bowl directly below the impeller skirt. This lateral bowl ring is to reduce the wear of the impeller skirt. Original capacities and efficiencies are to be maintained by adjustment of the top shaft nut at the top of the motor. The impellers shall be of bronze enclosed type only, accurately machined and finished, and balanced. They shall be securely fastened to the impeller shaft with a steel taper bushing. The impeller shaft shall be of stainless steel of not less than 12% chrome. The impeller shaft shall be supported by a combination of water lubricated, fluted rubber and bronze bearings. Discharge and suction cases shall both be fitted with steel sand collars. All bowl bolting shall be of stainless steel.<BR> <BR><BR>11.0	STRAINER<BR><BR>The bell suction shall be fitted with a bronze basket strainer supplied with a suction screen that has an area 4 times the area of the pump suction.  The strainer grid shall not allow anything large enough to clog the impeller.<BR><BR><BR>12.0	PERFORMANCE TEST<BR><BR>The performance of the pump shall be determined by a series of test points sufficient in number to develop a constant-speed curve over the range of total heads corresponding to those illustrated by the attached system curve. The performance/test range shall include additional testing at total heads 2 feet higher than the total head. The lowest total head for testing shall be, as a minimum, the total head determined from paragraph Operating Conditions. If the test setup permits testing at lower total heads, the range of total heads shall be extended 2 feet lower. Tests shall be made using prototype total heads. Head differentials between adjacent test points shall not exceed 3 feet, but in no case shall less than 10 points be plotted in the pumping range. If the plot of the data indicates a possibility of instability or dip in the head-versus-capacity curve, a sufficient number of additional points on either side of instability shall be made to clearly define the head-capacity characteristics. When a scale model of the pump is tested, the efficiency of the prototype pump shall be considered to be the efficiency of the model. No other computation or adjustment of model efficiency to prototype conditions will be permitted.<BR><BR>13.0	COATINGS<BR><BR>The assemblies indicated shall be coated with a NSF approved Scotchkote 134 fusion bonded epoxy with a dry film thickness of 10-12 mil. All surface preparation shall be in accordance with the coating manufacturers recommendations. <BR><BR>Bowl unit--- inside and outside surface with Scotchkote 134<BR>Column inside surface--- Scotchkote 134 <BR>Column outside surfaces--- Scotchkote 134<BR>Discharge head exterior surfacesmanufacturers standard air-dry enamel<BR>Discharge head inside surfaces--- Scotchkote 134<BR><BR>14.0	FACTORY ASSEMBLY<BR><BR>The pump shall be assembled at the manufacturer's plant [ in a vertical position] to assure proper fitting and alignment of all parts. Rotating elements shall be checked for binding.
