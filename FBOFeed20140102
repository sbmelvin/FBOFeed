<DESC>This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal. 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to extend its current contract with Verocel, Inc, 234 Littleton Road, Suite 2A, Westford, MA 01886 to purchase and store for one (1) year 2,085 Micron PCN 30880 memory chips, part number MT46V128M8TG6TA. 
 
In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the FAA's decision to increase the scope of this contract via single-source procedures.  The rational basis for this decision is: Verocel, Inc. is currently executing the Safety Computer Development Contract.  Pre-Production units were recently accepted from Verocel and the contract is moving into the Integration and Application Demonstration Phases.  Failure to procure these memory chips before they become obsolete would require redesigning the Safety Computer unit and recertification.  The exact memory chip is required; otherwise, recertification of the hardware and software would be required. Due to the limited availability of the chip, it is in the FAAs best interest to use the current development contract to procure the Micron PCN 30880 memory chips.

If you have any questions or comments on this contract action, please contact the Contracting Officer, Jacqueline Haralson no later than 5 p.m. January 10, 2014, at Jacqueline.haralson@faa.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a sole source order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-11-G-0003, with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI), to furnish the personnel, services, facilities, equipment and material necessary to perform other engineering, manufacturing and services to produce and deliver an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) with a Statement of Work (SOW) for the Tail Rotor Gearbox (TRGB) Mounting design effort. Since inception of the USMC H-l Upgrades program, BHTI has been the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the H-l weapon system. BHTI was awarded the Engineering Manufacturing &amp; Development (EMD) contract in 1996. BHTI is the only source with the requisite knowledge and experience to complete development, integration, and production of the H-l to meet the USMC requirements. The Government does not have a complete technical data and computer software package, nor sufficient license rights in the technical data and computer software delivered to date necessary to conduct a competition, and BHTI will not sell such a package to the Government. Therefore, BHTI is the sole source that can complete these requirements.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Charles W. Johnson, using the contact information provided in this synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact BHTI directly.</p>

<DESC>The Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office, intends to solicit on a 100% small business set-aside basis for genealogy research services for the Navy Casualty Division, Chief of Naval Personnel, Millington, TN in order to identify living maternal and paternal relatives and family members, who by law, can direct disposition of remains as requested by the Department of the Navy for unaccounted-for Navy service members from past wars and conflicts (WWII through Desert Storm).  The product of the search will include a limited family tree to demonstrate relationship to the Unaccounted-For Navy service member, the current address, current phone numbers, and all research documentation developed during the genealogical search.
  Genealogy requests will typically be in the form of one of two phases.  However, a request may be for both Phase I and Phase II information in the same search request.  Phase I is a limited, cost effective search to initiate contact with the families of Unaccounted-For Navy service members and to identify mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), y-DNA or nuclear (Autosomal) eligible donors.  Phase II is a detailed search to establish, in a legally sufficient manner, the Primary Next of Kin (PNOK) for Unaccounted-For Navy service members.  The period of performance for this contract will be a base period of 12-months with four 12-month options totaling 60 months if all options are exercised. 

The Navy intends to solicit for a Firm Fixed Priced, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.
  Interested vendors will be asked to submit cost and technical proposals and will be evaluated on a best value basis with technical more important than price.  Solicitation N00189-14-Q-Z004, with its respective amendments, will be available to download at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website (www.neco.navy.mil) in the near future.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 561611.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

Purpose:  To procure a lodging and a meal package in support of the Next Step Advanced Marriage Retreat program for the period 14 thru 16 February 2014 and the Basic Marriage Enrichment Retreat 6 thru 8 June 2014.

Mission:  To provide a safe and comfortable environment to host a two-day retreat for the Veterans and their spouses from the VISN 7 catchment areas.  

Period and Place of Performance:  The selected facility for this retreat must be in McCormick, South Carolina due to budget constraints and couples' requirements.  It must be available for two consecutive nights.  The retreats are scheduled for Friday, 14 February 2014 at 1:00 p.m. when the instructor team will arrive thru Sunday, 16 February 2014 at 5:00 p.m.   The other retreat will follow the same start and end time for June period of use.  Room check out on Sunday will be in accordance with the facility's posted checkout time but scheduled events will still be in session through 5:00 p.m. that afternoon.  

Background:  Retreats are opened to all Veterans in VISN 7 as a whole.  The facility must be in a pleasant and calming atmosphere due to mental health issues that many of our Veterans suffer from such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) etc. that is a cause for a Veteran to panic, withdraw and even run from the facility.

Performance Objectives/Results:  The vendor in the specified area must offer a facility large enough to accommodate the quantity of couples required for these marriage retreats.  Offerors must satisfy the government's requirement for the Marriage Enrichment Retreat for Veterans and spouses suffering with marriage issues largely as a result of mental health issues and stress.  It must be a facility that will meet the government requirements for lodging vacancies, counseling facilities and area activities needed to ensure complete compliance and goals are met during the specified times and dates scheduled as defined in operating constraints below.  It must be a one-stop facility equipped to provide a venue for great couple interactions and team building.  

Operating Constraints:  The facility must have: 

A  block of 20 rooms each having two double size beds, private bath, alarm clock, television and other routine amenities, at least one (1) of the rooms must be handicapped accessible for Veteran use if needed for the period 14 thru 16 February 2014.

Buffet meals (all) must be furnished by the location which would include dinner on Friday, breakfast, lunch and dinner on Saturday, and breakfast and lunch on Sunday for 40 participants at each meal/service during the period of use specified above.  

A special reserved area of the dining room is requested for all meals to allow separation of the Veterans from crowds due to mental health and stress related issues.  The Government will provide any medical/mental health assistance necessary for the Veteran during the event and the facility will not be responsible for such assistance. 

Exclusive use of the Convention Center for the February retreat, which would consist of an area measuring 32 feet by 48 feet to provide ample space for the couples to spread out and move about freely.  It will be furnished with comfortable chairs, two conference style tables for the instructors to sit, easy restroom access, aesthetically pleasing and quiet environment which is obstacle free and having appropriate natural and substantial indoor lighting for evening sessions.

<DESC>The Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA) is considering a partial small business set-aside for the acquisition of engineering services for the Advanced Technology Support Program IV (ATSP4), which will be the next in a highly successful series of engineering services IDIQ contracts.  The purpose of this announcement is to solicit survey responses and short capability statements from small businesses to better understand the capabilities of the small business engineering services industry.<br /><br />ATSP4 is a uniform technical and management approach that leverages advanced technologies to meet the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) for a quick reaction capability across the entire spectrum of technology development, acquisition, and long-term support.  This capability includes the development of appropriate solutions to keep a system operational, elevate sophistication level, or meet new threats.  These efforts may include developing components to meet the DoD's requirements for ultra-low volumes, extending component availability, or ensuring a trusted, assured, and secure supply of microelectronics; also included will be the intelligent and rapid application of advanced technologies to add needed performance enhancements to DoD weapon systems in response to traditional and irregular (asymmetric) threats and to the problems related to aging weapon systems.  Increasing warfighter capabilities and providing solutions to electronics support problems-such as, reliability, maintainability and obsolescence-are accomplished through the development and insertion of applications of advanced microelectronics technologies.  The scope of ATSP4 covers both hardware and software and includes studies, analysis, design, software, simulation, prototyping, integration, testing, producibility, and limited production.  The scope of ATSP4 also includes the development of viable methods and procedures for using available tools and resources, strategies for resolution of replacement alternatives, and technical interchange in support of task accomplishment.<br /><br />A Source Selection methodology will be utilized which anticipates multiple awards for this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract. Results and feedback received will be used to help us shape the optimal contracting arrangement for small business participation and, ultimately, the Request for Proposal (RFP). At a later date, DMEA will establish a web site located at: http://www.dmea.osd.mil/atsp4ss, where associated documentation will be posted. This site will utilize an interactive RFP approach where the solicitation will be refined through the analysis of industry comments and suggestions, which are encouraged. Posted information is non-binding and subject to change. In support of DoD paperless initiatives, all communications regarding this acquisition will be electronic.<br /><br />Complete survey responses, with an emailed one-page capability assessment, are requested by this posting.  The survey can be accessed through the URL below.  Please, only one response per business segment; company name and business segment identification in the survey is required.<br /><br />The survey can be accessed at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/ATSP4SS-1<br /><br />Based on the responses to this notice, a virtual industry day is anticipated for this requirement, once initial market research is conducted, in order to solicit further feedback and to anticipate potential and support appropriate, successful small business involvement.

<SUBJECT>Single Family Post Insurance Claims Processing
<SOLNBR>DU100R-H-2014-028

<CONTACT>diane toledo-gaskins, Contracting Officer, Phone 2024024140, Email diane.e.toledo-gaskins@hud.gov
<DESC>Single Family Post Insurance Division
<p><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to maintain and operate an off-site Single Family Post Insurance Division/Single Family Claims Support Center that provides a variety of contractor technical and support services. These activities include services to analyze, calculate and recommend action on supplemental claims, collect incoming mail, prescreen and batch claim packages in preparation for data entry, open and direct other pieces of correspondence and/or documents to Single Family Claims Branch (SFCB) staff and perform file maintenance activities. The contractor will adhere to the rules, regulations, laws, standards and conventions identified by HUD as well as within the Federal Government. The contractor shall be accountable for all work done to comply with the requirements and deliverables, as well as be responsible to the Government. <br /><br />Background: The SFCB responsibilities include the receipt and disposition of mail and correspondence relating to claims processing, claim forms and other miscellaneous documents. With the recent enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, FHA Modernization Act of 2008, the SFCB receives a significant increase in claims forms and other supporting documentation from mortgagees, Home Ownership Centers (HOC) representatives, Headquarters (HQ) staff, and servicing agents. A lack of control or delays in the processing and delivery of incoming mail cause delays in claim processing. Such delays cause the Department to incur greater costs in higher claim payments and a decrease in customer satisfaction as to the timeliness of our services to them.</p>
<p>Claim processing is highly automated and carried out by the Single Family Claims (also known as A43C) subsystem of the Single Family Insurance System/Insurance in Force (SFIS/IIF). Fiscal year (FY) 2013 claim volume was 500,000 transactions. Approximately 80 percent were processed automatically, with an estimated 100,000 claims processed as exceptions which required manual intervention. Certain processes are not automated and the affected claims must be processed manually, as are exceptions that occur within the automated processes. To ensure that claims submitted by mortgagees for FHA insurance benefits are reviewed and processed in an accurate and timely manner, the SFCB requires support in its control and processing of supplemental claims, delivery of incoming mail and file maintenance.</p>
<p>Objectives: The SFCB seeks to identify if there are sufficient certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses contractors with the appropriate qualifications, commitment, and experience either internally generated by using their own employees or through teaming or subcontracting to:<br />(a) analyze, calculate, and process supplemental claims, (b) collect incoming mail and direct it as appropriate, (c) prescreen and batch incoming paper claims to be keypunched, and (d) perform file maintenance.</p>
<p>The Contractor(s) must satisfy the following requirements. Provide a detailed description of your company's (including its teammates, if applicable) experience and demonstrated abilities to deliver each and every one separately of the following requirements:</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br /><br />The Reference Number is F1M3B23176AC01. The 628th Contracting Squadron, 101 E. Hill Blvd., Joint Base Charleston, intends to award a sole source contract for AT&amp;T- Owned Telecommunications Maintenance Service for Joint Base Charleston Weapons Station.</p>
<p>The 628th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Bellsouth Telecommunications, Inc. dba AT&amp;T, 2180 Lake Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319-6004. Market research was performed and information gathered in determining this company to be the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>In accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 5.207(c)(15), the proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals; however responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The justification for the sole source requirements as follows:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 6.303-2:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Activity: 628 Contracting Squadron, Joint Base Charleston, SC</p>
<p>(2) Nature of action being approved: Sole source acquisition.</p>
<p>(3) The purpose of this acquisition is to provide outside plant operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) services for telecommunications voice and data circuits beyond the AT&amp;T established demarcation site to Building Entrance Terminals at end user building on Joint Base Charleston (JB CHS) Weapons Station, Goose Creek, SC.</p>
<p>(4) Justification Rationale: IAW FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) One source is capable of providing the service because AT&amp;T will not permit another company to have any accesses or rights to their cable.</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration of Unique Qualifications: The infrastructure (wiring and equipment) specified under this requirement is owned by AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T is the only vendor authorized to provide outside plant O&amp;M services on AT&amp;T-owned infrastructure located on JB Charleston Weapons Station.</p>
<p>(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a) (2), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</p>
<p>(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previous awards made for same service and comparison to other agencies that offer wireless internet service.</p>
<p>(8) Description of market research: A search of other service providers in the areas revealed that they are not authorized to perform this service Joint Base Charleston.</p>
<p>(9) Other supporting facts: The infrastructure (wiring and equipment) is owned by AT&amp;T. It would not be economical to replace the present infrastructure with another company's infrastructure.</p>
<p>(10) Interested Sources: Several companies were found who provide this service, however none are able to install their infrastructure.</p>
<p>(11) Actions to prevent barriers that may lead to restricted consideration in the future: <br />None at this time.</p>
<p>(12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Address questions to Lisa (Boyd) Mitchell, Contract Specialist, at (843) 963-4492, fax (843) 963-5183, email lisa.boyd.3@us.af.mil and Tamara Kostos, Contracting Officer, Phone (843) 963-5158, email tamara.kostos@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source option period under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Pulsar Informatics, Inc. (Pulsar); Philadelphia, PA 19104, for the development of a Individualized Fatigue-Based Scheduling and Countermeasure System in support of the Advanced Medical Development Program at the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD. The services are essential for an additional 9 month option period under contract N62645-12-C-4004 to be able to complete additional evaluations that were not originally contained in the contract, making it possible to finalize the software. The estimated value of the contract extension is $882,276.00.
<p>Due to Pulsar already having assessed on other ship-based Naval platforms and completed the desktop exercise with the submarine community, the leadership and staff require no training time, very little hiring time and already have the critical contacts for recruitment and assessment to complete the project. The feasibility of another group being able to complete this project from implementation, assessment, analysis and reporting in the time which this contract would be complete (less than 1 year) is extremely unlikely and would result in a duplication of work and costs.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability. All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All capability statements received by 3:30 PM Eastern Time, 17 January 2014 will be considered by the Government. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.</p>

CredAbility is unique among HUD-approved national housing counseling intermediaries in that it maintains an extensive research dataset on its HECM clients, and that dataset provides much more detailed information on the financial condition of HECM applicants over time than is available from any other readily available source. Participation of CredAbility in the study is of critical importance to Ohio State University researchers because of the extensive historical database on HECM clients that CredAbility maintains, and because CredAbility is an existing partner with OSU in both the MacArthur Foundation and HUD grants funding other parts of this research.<br />This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.

Med Associates was contacted and they confirmed that they do not have any authorized dsitributors in North America. The required chambers must be compatible with USAMRICD's current Med Associates operant equipment, including computer software, interface cabinet, and 28V power supply. Med Associates is the only company which manufactures chambers which will allow USAMRICD complete compatibility with their existing equipment.  The compatibility will allow USAMRICD to continue to use existing software and programming practices that only work with Med Associates components.   <br>  <br> This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days, 20 January 2014, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable supplies and services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. Response to this award is to be sent to roman.e.laterza.civ@mail.mil . <br>

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Directorate of Procurement is increasing the value of the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) version 1.1 contract, H92222-13-D-0013, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, which was awarded on 23 August 2013 to General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GDOTS). An increase of approximately $1.4M is anticipated in order to enable Production Qualification Testing (PQT). The increase will result in an estimated contract value of $564M and will apply to the following requirements:
<p>&bull; Prototype Vehicles - increase maximum qty from 7 to 9;<br />&bull; C4ISR Material/Integration for Prototype Vehicle - increase maximum qty from 7 to 9;<br />&bull; Surrogate Armor Kit - increase maximum qty from 1 to 3; and <br />&bull; Conduct pre-Critical Design Review (CDR) vehicle test.</p>
<p>This increase is required in order to conduct PQT at multiple test sites, run the necessary test miles and events, and be able to remain on program schedule to meet the required delivery schedule of the production vehicles. Additionally, the ability to conduct a pre-CDR vehicle test is required in order to lower Government risk prior to locking down the configuration in the CDR. Substitution of these items with incompatible products would void test results utilized for safety release and fielding to Special Operations Forces. The pursuit of full and open competition would result in unacceptable delays and substantial duplicate costs. All questions and comments regarding this matter should be directed to Mrs. Verdetta Weaver at verdetta.weaver@socom.mil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis to provide Field Support Services in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as applicable, and supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI-RML6-14004 and the solicitation is being issued as a Notice of Intent on a sole source basis.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="color: #101010;">The purpose of this acquisition is to allow the development of </span><span>a monoclonal-based antigen capture assay specific to T. solium taenia( tapeworm). The methodology is straight forward and uses techniques and reagents that are available or producible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) will be produced in mice to excretory-secretory antigens of T.solium tapeworms by harvesting and culturing in vitro developing tapeworms grown in immunosuppressed hamsters. Mice will be immunized per protocol, the immune sera tested for reactivity and Mabs produced by standard techniques. Clones will be screened by a standard ELISA assay for reactive clones employing E-S products to T. solium tapeworms. Positive clones will then be recloned and Mabs tested in various formats for use in taenia antigen capture assays. There is a well-defined set of feces (T. solium or T. saginata infected, nematode infected, other tapeworm infected or not infected), that has previously been used to determine sensitivity and specifity for the above-mentioned assay that can be used in testing for this project. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span>Because the life cycle of T. solium and various stages are not present in the U.S., by necessity experiments need to be performed in endemic regions such as in Peru.</span><span> </span><span>Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia is a supported research laboratory in Lima, Peru, that is devoted to the study of T. solium. This laboratory has access to all stages of the parasite. This will<span style="color: #101010;"> allow continued support for collaborative research between NIH and the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru and specifically this will allow development of a test to specifically diagnose T. solium tapeworm carriers, which could lead to elimination of this disease.</span></span></p>

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-14-Q-200045 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72.  

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to American Eurocopter Corporation (AEC) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Eurocopter France. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AEC is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.    

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-14-Q	-200045 REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. 
Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

The Government reserves the right to withhold any item or group of items contained in this solicitation upon award.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, no award, or multiple awards if after considering the additional administrative costs it is in the Governments best interest to do so.  The Government shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation.  Individual awards shall be for the items or combinations of items that result in the lowest cost to the Government including the assumed administrative costs.  

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED TERMS AND CONDITIONS  HSCG38-14-Q-200045 FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. 
If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

      (5) Payment request means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the contractor under this contract.
  (b) Electronic payment requests. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form. Purchases paid with a Government-wide commercial purchase card are considered to be an electronic transaction for purposes of this rule, and therefore no additional electronic invoice submission is required.
  (c) Data transmission. A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format are through one of the following:
      (1) VA's Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System. (See Web site at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.)

  (d) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.
  (e) Exceptions. If, based on one of the circumstances below, the contracting officer directs that payment requests be made by mail, the contractor shall submit payment requests by mail through the United States Postal Service to the designated agency office. Submission of payment requests by mail may be required for:
      (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
      (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
      (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
      (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach for SC involving remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 5 November 2013 and attachments posted to&nbsp;FedBizOpps for the latest documents.<br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong> <br />The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong>Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.<br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.
<p>Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $10M and $15M. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Christina Fernandez.<br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong>Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by date of award, the PCO will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong>The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.</p>
<strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong>An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirement requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Fairchild Air Force Base may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the <br />independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br />Note: CH2M HILL Constructors, Inc (CH2M HILL) has recently completed conducting investigations and/or focused remedial design pilot testing at two Fairchild Air Force Base Environmental Restoration Program sites under USACE contract W91238-06-D-0013. The two sites represent a significant part of the Fairchild Air Force Base PBR. The following documents have been delivered in draft form and will be posted to the RFP key documents site:
<p>i. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB, Site SS-39 Pre-Design Investigations.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB Site SS-39 Injection Summary.</p>
<p>However, for site SD-37 (which is included in subject contract and this PBR), CH2M HILL delivered an initial draft technical memorandum that is not sufficient for the Air Force to post at this time. We intend to post some of the associated data attachments to the CH2M HILL Technical Memorandum, Fairchild Air Force Base, Site SD-37 Datagap Investigation and Analysis, however, without the full context of the associated technical memorandum, this presents a conflict of interest where CH2M HILL has access to site investigation not available to other Offerors.<br /><br />CH2M HILL recently completed conducting optimization of&nbsp;Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 remedy under contract FA4890-06-D-0007-0001. As part of that optimization, CH2M HILL built and operated site Soil Vapor Extraction and In-Situ Chemical Oxidation remedy optimization components. CH2M HILL representatives have stated they have all of the actual construction and operational cost data associated with the remedy optimization components readily available, but have not provided the information in their draft report of the optimization effort. This detailed information will be needed for the Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 Proposed Plan and Record of Decision Amendment preparation, which is a required task of the PBR. This information has not been provided in a format readily available to other Offerors and therefore, potential Offerors will have to re-create by estimating all of the associated parameters and costs. Based on this, CH2M Hill has a conflict of interest because they have information that is not readily available to other Offerors.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; background: white;">Solicitation No. BBG50-R-14-0001<br />Questions and Answers<br />Extended - January 13, 2014</p>
<p>"Solicitation No. BBG50-R-14-0001 is hereby amended to extend the response deadline to Monday, January 13, 2014. There will be no further questions accepted during this extension. All previous offerors that submitted a proposal is welcome to re-submit another proposal at your discretion and expense. In response to questions received from vendors on the subject RFQ, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is providing responses with the following information cited below:"<br /><br />Question No. 1:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; background: white;">
<p>For the 10 minute demo segment, are you looking for something like a screen test for analyzing the talent's on-air appearance, language skills and delivery? Or are you looking for an actual story line with the talent, again for analysis, but also including b-roll, graphics, etc. which would be more like 1/3 of an actual program?</p>
<p>Answer: The 10-minute demo segment's content is at the Offeror's professional and creative discretion. The on-air talent will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>Question No. 2:</p>
<p>To clarify the production details, are you expecting Farsi-speaking reporters on location in LA, NY, DC London and the Middle East, as news breaks? Or are you expecting to see B-Roll from those locations with the studio host describing the events? We understand there may be two hosts, perhaps a male and a female but the question is whether they (or one of them) is supposed to "on the scene" as events unfold, or simply reporting over the b-roll seen on the studio set's monitors.</p>
<p>Answer: The show is to be shot on location on the West Coast of the United States (primarily Los Angeles), per the SOW. The Agency is expecting Farsi-speaking reporters on location in Los Angeles, CA. The hosts are expected to be in studio. The episode content is at the Offeror's professional and creative discretion and that the Offeror shall comply with the SOW.</p>
<p>Question No. 3:</p>
<p>Do you expect to have remote live conversations during the studio shooting using systems such as Skype or Google Hangouts on the Air?</p>
<p>Answer: The episode content is at the Offeror's professional and creative discretion.</p>
<p>Question No. 4:</p>
<p>Is there an incumbent for this work? Who is the incumbent for this work? Is there an incumbent vendor for previous series of this type that may have worked on politics, but will now simply switch to entertainment angle?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no incumbent for this requirement.</p>
<p>Question No. 5:</p>
<p>What is the expected target range of the contract's value?</p>
<p>Answer: The contract's value will be determined by the competitive range of the technically acceptable offerors.</p>
<p>Question No. 6:</p>
<p>What other companies have you worked with to support similar efforts in the past?</p>
<p>Answer: BBG has produced similar programming in-house. BBG is seeking for the Contractor to complete a turnkey requirement in accordance with the SOW.</p>
<p>Question No. 7:</p>
<p>Since the numbers of remotes, and the locations of where relevant events are unfolding, are both extremely variable, is there a way to suggest to prospective vendors a set number of locations and specific target cities we all should use for budgeting? Without a consistent number, and representative target locations, it will be extremely difficult to compare submitted budgets.</p>
<p>Answer: The show is to be shot on location on the West Coast of the United States (primarily Los Angeles, CA), per the SOW. The agency is only requiring Farsi-speaking reporters on location in Los Angeles, CA. The Offeror may, in its discretion, provide remotes and reporters at other locations at its discretion, but BBG is not requiring it. Offerors will not be evaluated on their ability to provide reporters in locations outside of Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>Question No. 8:</p>
<p>As an alternative, is there a way to structure the proposal so travel and lodging are managed under a separate contract?</p>
<p>Answer: No. BBG is seeking for the Contractor to complete a turnkey requirement in accordance with the SOW.</p>
<p>Question No. 9:</p>
<p>The contract describes 55 days for production of the first program (45 days for production + 10 days for approval) followed by 4 shows per month for the next three months. This totals 13. <br />1. Is this the plan for the second series of 13 programs?<br />2. If so, then should vendors plan for the same 55 days before the 14th show is delivered? This means there will be a two-month gap between show #13 and show #14 and this is repeated on each new 13 part series.</p>
<p>Answer: The second series of programming is in the option period that may or may not be exercised. The deliverable schedule will be determined by the COR prior to performance.</p>
<p>Question No. 10:</p>
<p>Has the BBG considered pulling talent from the existing roster of VOA talent pool?</p>
<p>Answer: Hiring talent for the show that is the subject of this procurement is the responsibility of the Offeror.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This short-term contract is required to maintain continuous prime vendor coverage and uninterrupted services until implementation of a new, competitively awarded contract can be put in place.<br /><br />The current contract for Wellness Services, which contains a Collective Bargaining Agreement, expired on November 21, 2013.&nbsp; FAR 22.1002-3(a) requires successor contractors performing on contracts in excess of $2,500 for substantially the same services performed in the same locality to pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) at least equal to those contained in any bona-fide collective bargaining agreement entered into under the predecessor contract.&nbsp; Thus, the CBA must be included in the solicitation to provide interested&nbsp;parties the information needed to craft a realistic price proposal.&nbsp; When the Contracting Activity requested the CBA, it was advised the CBA was in the process of being re-negotiated.&nbsp; The Contracting Activity received the CBA Addendum via e-mail on October 1, 2013, during which time the Federal Government was shut down.&nbsp; The Federal Government did not re-open for business until Thursday, October 17, 2013.<br /><br />The current contractor, Basic Contracting Services, Inc. (BCSi) is familiar with the Wellness Center operations and already has staff, supplies, and resources needed on site.&nbsp; Because another company would require lead time to recruit, establish employment and payroll records, and order any supplies required to perform the contract, BCSi is the only company that can feasibly perform the work at this time.&nbsp; This contract will serve the need to keep the Wellness Center operations in place while allowing sufficient lead time to obtain approvals from all levels needed to re-compete and award a new contract.&nbsp; The period of four (4) months is needed to allow sufficient time for upcoming annual leave, holiday leave and to consider the possibility of another government shutdown in January 2014.<br /><br />Wellness services are needed for mine inspectors attending and residing at the Academy so t hey are able to maintain physical fitness and the ability to perform the tasks their jobs require.&nbsp; Wellness services promote the daily physical activity and well-being of these employees.&nbsp; MSHA's Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual states that physical conditioning training is a formal part of each module of regularly scheduled training.<br />

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS AWARD NOTICE IS ISSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE FOR THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 AND FAR SUBPART 5.705.
<p>Contract Number SB1341-11-CN-0011 was awarded to Wiklund Research and Design of Concord, MA, on February 28, 2011, in the amount of $1,206,648.00. All work must be completed not later than February 27, 2012.</p>
<p>Work required under this contract shall provide all labor, materials and equipment necessary to develop Usability Guidelines and an Evaluation Framework for Electronic Health Records Systems.</p>
<p>The above referenced work will be completed under a time and materials contract. Due to multiple unknowns associated with the project, a firm fixed price could not be established with any reasonable degree of confidence. Unknowns include: uncertainty regarding the frequency and location of meetings that the Contractor will require to complete the required work; uncertainty with respect to the number of Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs) available and being utilized in the professional marketplace; and use of a firm fixed price contract was anticipated to limit competition and increase the cost to the Government due to a significant amount of risk.</p>

<DESC>Electrochemical machining is a non-contact machining method that is well suited to the fabrication of complex difficult to machine materials.  Unlike conventional machining processes, ECM is not affected by material strength, hardness, or toughness which can cause significant processing time and increase defect rate in high strength materials.  High tolerance material removal with superior surface finish is well within the capabilities of ECM however rapid bulk material removal is a challenge. In an effort to improve field readiness and reduced component costs ECM is being applied to the manufacture of complex Inconel 718 components. The use of a rapid material removal will improve the success of this effort and may have future applicability to other Ben t Laboratories mission components. less than br greater than  less than br greater than Inconel 718 is used extensively in the aerospace industry for complex turbine engine components. The excellent high strength properties at high temperatures results in a difficult to machine material that adds complexity, cost and time to the manufacturing of components.  General Electric (GE) has matured electrochemical machining (ECM) methods to achieve cost effective production of Inconel for aircraft engine components. GE has developed a trademark Blue Arc  process similar to ECM to remove large amounts of material more economically than standard ECM.  This process is well suited to the rough hole boring of the Inconel 718 for fabrication from solid stock. less than br greater than

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Navigation Center (USCG NAVCEN)&nbsp;intend to purchase Professional Maintenance Service for TRANSAS Proprietary TX-97 Vector Electronic Chart Information and Display System (ECIDS). The TRANSAS TX-97 ECIDS Console is currently deployed on all 87&rsquo; WPB&rsquo;s throughout the Coast Guard, along with selected 110 WPB&rsquo;s Cutters. Only the proprietary TRANSAS TX-97 Electronic Charts are compatible with this ECIDS.&nbsp;<br /><br />This requirement is a continuation of Professional Maintenance Service being provided by TRANSAS USA, Inc. under the current contract to NAVCEN. NAVCEN needs continued Professional Maintenance Service of the TX-97 to facilitate Chart updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;The USCG has been unable to identify any vendor that can provide Professional Maintenance Service for the proprietary TX-97 Chart Cards through Market Research conducted for the past seven consecutive years.&nbsp; Therefore, it is apparent that there are no interested or qualified sources to satisfy this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to avoid any disruption of&nbsp;the Professional Maintenance Service currently being provided by TRANSAS USA, Inc., the United States Coast Guard awarded a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order on a SOLE SOURCE basis to TRANSAS USA, Inc. based on their past experience maintaining the Chart Cards and sole proprietorship.&nbsp;
