DOE anticipates holding a pre-proposal conference, after the issuance of the Final RFP but prior to receiving proposals, in conjunction with a site visit for all interested potential offerors to attend at their own expense.  The pre-proposal conference and simultaneous site visit is intended to give potential offerors the ability to ask questions regarding the Final RFP and to get a hands-on look at the site that will be used to develop the site data package and Final RFP.  Questions and corresponding answers from the pre-proposal conference and site visit will be posted in IIPS for all potential offerors to view.  Information regarding the pre-proposal conference and site visit will be incorporated into the Final RFP.  DOE continues to urge all interested parties to submit recommendations for contract improvements (i.e. incentives and streamlining) via IIPS, under the above solicitation number, prior to the issuance of a Draft RFP.

<DESC>The National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate with the World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland for the continuation of a contract to maintain and coordinate research and training activities in relation to the prevention of blindness and for the utilization of eye care services in developing countries. The work to be performed will be as follows:  the contractor shall maintain an established coordination module for research activities. This includes preparing and refining research protocols and coordinating and obtaining clearances with relevant national authorities and the U.S. Government. The coordination module develops and maintains contacts with interested parties and collaborating personnel and institutions for the accomplishment of all research. The module also participates in the planning and implementation of necessary fieldwork. In addition, three tasks will be conducted. The first will be an evaluation of selected national blindness prevention programs with regard to the prevalence of visual impairment, impact on service delivery, patient outcomes, and assessment of global economic burden including direct monetary costs and personal costs related to a range of quality of life issues. This evaluation will include programs in China and India as well as six WHO regions, including Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Eastern Europe, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific. The second task will assess the magnitude and type of refractory anomalies in school-age children and in adults from different ethnic/cultural settings. The surveys in children will be conducted utilizing an already developed and approved study protocol, augmented with a new questionnaire to assess the range of activities requiring different refractive powers to serve as a surrogate for environmental exposures relative to vision. Assessment of the level of vision requiring correction of refractory anomalies will be considered relative to the level of resources commonly found in developing country health services. This task will comprise approximately a dozen surveys across the six WHO regions. The third task will provide technical assistance and guidelines for prevention of blindness research, interventions, and monitoring/evaluation of eye-care delivery outcomes. As part of this task, the contractor will convene a research policy and planning meeting to develop a broad-based plan of action for technology transfer and capacity building in developing countries and to evaluate the impact of these efforts on the delivery of eye care services. Workshops will be established to develop guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with eye diseases and disorders and evaluate the impact of these guidelines on the practice of eye care, including patient outcomes. This task will also entail investigation, across geographic regions and among diverse ethnic groups, of barriers hindering necessary and appropriate eye care services among persons with diabetes.  An international workshop to review the global burden of glaucoma will also be convened.  Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The cited authority is applicable because the World Health Organization is the only facility in the world that is uniquely qualified to conduct and complete this important international project.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  See Numbered Note 22.

The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Seal Beach requests responses from qualified sources capable of providing:  Line Item 0001:  Ventilation System for Paint Booth, 1) Exhaust plenum to house 60-72 three-stage filtration cells (exceeding NESHAP  MACT compliance), to include Ultra Flow HEPA filters @ 99.99% removal efficiency on particles 0.3 microns in size.  The exhaust plenum is to be made of a tubular steel frame and skinned with 16 gauge steel, prepped, primed and painted, with custom mechanical hold down devices for each HEPA filter to insure no exhaust air by-passes these filters.  2) The exhaust filter bank is to be designed for 50,000 cubic feet per minute (CFM), or ~100 feet per minute (fpm) cross draft flow of air through the spray chamber.  3) Large horizontal transitions, which allow for an even, uniform pull of air through the filter bank, are to be constructed within a tubular steel frame assembly for easy handling.  4) The air is to be channele!  d through two ~48 diameter ducts through the building wall to two Bac kward Inclined Centrifugal Fans with Airfoil wheels and AMCA B construction capable of delivering 25,000 CFM ea. @ 3.5 WG ea. with a 40 horse power (HP) premium efficiency totally enclosed fan cooled (TEFC) motor.  Also to be included is an OSHA approved drive cover.  The fans are to be provided with vibration isolation and factory mounted on stands ready to be set on a pad or concrete pillars with the necessary footings.  The fans are to be positioned in an up blast discharge orientation.  5) The exhaust stacks should each consist of a rectangular to round transition, ~48 diameter duct with an up blast, non back draft stack head to discharge a minimum of 6 above the building roofline.  The up blast discharge velocity is to be ~3000 fpm.  6) The Air Makeup Unit (AMU) is to be a direct-fired natural gas unit able to deliver 50,000 CFM of air with a 4,000,000 btu/hr burner capable of a 50 degree temperature rise.

Within the control panel shall be Allen Bradley Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to power the exhaust fan motors.  As the exhaust filters take on a load, the VFDs will speed up the exhaust fan motors to maintain a consistent exhaust ventilation rate regardless of loading conditions on the filters (maximum 1.25 load).   8) In order to monitor the exhaust flow rate, a multi port air flow station will be mounted on each exhaust duct.  An integrated Allen Bradley programmable logic controller (PLC) will both control and record air flow data, as required.  Also, a Clas!  s I, Div. I pressure transmitter will provide continuous monitoring of  the pressure drop across the exhaust filter bank, and in the event the hi or low limits are not maintained, the PLC will initiate a system shut down, with a fault message to appear on the Allen Bradley User Interface Screen indicating the problem.  The exhaust filter bank pressure drop reading should also be capable of being recorded.  9) The system shall be capable of displaying numerous other latching and non latching faults in the message box to facilitate trouble shooting and servicing of the equipment.  Each time a fault message appears, a red strobe light on the top of the control panel will be activated.  10) Provide interlocks for fire suppression and other OSHA requirements.  11) Include in the Budget Estimate Price the delivery and installation of all components listed above, including a forklift and personnel lift rental, and local crane services.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to conduct a wind tunnel test in a Polysonic Wind Tunnel.  The Crew Launch Vehicle project is preparing an aerodynamic database that characterizes the vehicle throughout the speed regime of ascent flight where aerodynamic effects are important.	This speed regime begins at liftoff and continues through first-stage separation or about Mach 6.  The aerodynamic database will be used to determine the CLV performance, stability & control effectiveness and structural stability. Verification of the loads database produced using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is needed through comparison with wind tunnel data from a pressure instrumental model. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the services from Boeing, Inc. who is the only known responsible source.  To support the assessment of the CLV configuration, the data to develop the aerodynamic database is required over the ascent Mach range.  A 0.01-scale ( ~ 38 long) wind tunnel model has been built to test at NASA LaRCs Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, for the Mach range 1.5-4.6.  Data is required at the lower speeds for the initial phase of ascent.  The Boeing Polysonic wind tunnel test covers the Mach range 0.4-1.6 providing data for the early ascent phase for CLV flight.  This facility allows the use of the existing model and sting hardware.  There are no NASA facilities available with this Mach range and size. The Boeing Polysonic tunnel is the only known blow-down facility with the specific Mach number range, Reynolds number, and size to satisfy the wind tunnel testing requirement.  Also, to eliminate tunnel to tunnel differences, both the force and moment model and the pressure model should be tested in the same facilities.  The force and moment model was tested in the Boeing Polysonic facility due to CLVs specific test requirements, so for the complimentary pressure model, the Boeing Polysonic facility is also required.  The authority for this action is the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996), and 10 USC 2304(c)(1).    The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 11, 2006.	  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<SUBJECT>A--ToxCast Prioritization of Environmentally Relevant Chemicals 2
<SOLNBR>PR-HQ-06-14708
<RESPDATE>070106
<CONTACT>JOHN J. NANARTOWICZ, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-4756, E-Mail: nanartowicz.john@epa.gov
<DESC>This solicitation is the second issued for the TOXCAST PROGRAM by the Headquarters Procurement Operations Division of the Office of Acquisition Management of the U.S. EPA.  THE TWO REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED IN THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE PROCURED AS FOLLOWS:  FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURE for Performance Work Statement (PWS) P#2; and SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE COMPETITIVE PROCEDURE for PWS P#6.   THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE for the SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES!! BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT)  in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context. Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.  SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS). The contracts that will be awarded from these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals. This Request for Proposals (RFP) (# PR-HQ-06-14708) will be soliciting proposals for two (2) of the seven (7) PWS that make up the laboratory services requirement of the ToxCast Program.  Potential offerors and interested parties should visit the EPA website to review all documents that relate to the program and these procurements.  The EPA website is  at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm   The two (2) performance work statements under this RFP will be procured using the following methods: FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for P#2; SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for P#6.  It should be noted that hard copies of the RFP will not be mailed out, but will be available for down-loading from the EPA website along with all associated and supporting documents. Email the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" to express your interest in this solicitation package.  Please include in your e-mail your firms complete name and address for Source List purposes.  Due to the anticipated large volume of interest, we will be unable to return phone calls or respond to e-mail inquiries for these procurements.  You may be able to retrieve a copy of the RFP package on or about June 5, 2006.

<DESC>Since the PRC Web site http://www.prc.gov was placed into production, the PRC Information Technology organization has continued to improve the site to the point that it has been accepted by the user community as an indispensable tool for interfacing with the PRC by performing tasks such as filing legal documents, retrieving case material and decisions, and providing information about PRC activities.  The PRC Web site has proven to be a reliable, cost effective solution for transacting business with a widely distributed user base.  

The PRC Web site is comprised of standard HTML pages with occasional embedded JavaScript code, and ASP pages containing scripts written in VBScript.  As currently installed it uses Frames to separate navigation from content.   The application interfaces with an Oracle 9i database containing docketed documents.

The PRC Web application provides information to the mailing community about Postal affairs, but a major function of the application is to provide the capability for case intervenors and other parties to electronically file, research, and retrieve legal documents.  The site has not been formally documented, and this will be a deliverable under the scope of this contract.

The Supplier shall provide personnel that have the necessary skills and knowledge to professionally document the current Web site and, upon implementation, document the new production site, redesign the user interface according to general design criteria supplied by the PRC, create a prototype of the redesigned site to be approved by the PRC, test the redesigned application thoroughly and meticulously, and move the approved prototype to production with no downtime and no adverse impact to the user community and the PRC production environment.   Care must be taken to preserve as much of the original code as possible within the bounds of the redesigned interface.  

See the accompanying Request for Proposal for more detail concerning Tasks and Deliverables.

The PRC expects to award a Time & Materials Task Order in response to this RFP.

The anticipated period of performance shall be as follows:

Base Period	Contract award date through September 30, 2007
Option 1	October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008

Exercise of option will be at the discretion of the PRC and will be dependent upon funding availability, requirements for continued services, and the Supplier?s record of performance.  

At the discretion of the PRC, Phases (see RFP Section 3.2) may be incrementally funded.  Business needs may dictate that gaps occur between the end of one Phase and the start of work on a subsequent Phase.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying  RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00225.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS  code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfer Oxides : Statistical Issues and Analyses in Epidemiologic Studies II.  Period of Performance: September 2006-September 2008 III.   Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   157 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of  this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality  Criteria Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2 at 0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 0.030 ppm  annual arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies, which  updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the EPA  announced its proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.  In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited  comments on adding a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not appropriate at that time.  	The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and  will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a  number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. 	The scientific information on SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The  first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA.  This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the  peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA  anticipates preparing two drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final SOx SA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on SOx  physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. 	Under this order, the EPA seeks the  professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not post the entire  information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor or consultant is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Courtney Whiting at whiting.courtney@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying  RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00227.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS  code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.     Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfur Oxides - Epidemiologic Studies of Acute Morbidity II.    Period of Performance:  September 2006 - September 2008 III.  Type of  Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   293 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task 9-10) BACKGROUND 	The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this  process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria  Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2 at 0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 0.030 ppm annual  arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies, which updated the  scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the EPA announced its  proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.  In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited comments on adding  a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not appropriate at that time.  	The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be  established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates  for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. 	The scientific information on SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD  will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA.  This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review comments are  incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates preparing two  drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final SOx SA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on SOx physical and chemical  properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. 	Under this order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an  expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz  Ops website.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement.

VZIN (Visualization with-IN) brings advanced visualization capabilities to the everyday information worker to accelerate the exploration, management, and analysis of large datasets.  VZIN quickly and automatically conveys the major themes of large sets of numerical or textual data in a familiar environment with a common look and feel.  There are a few powerful visualization tools already on the market but none that we believe to integrate as seamlessly and effortlessly into the Microsoft Windows environment. VZIN addresses key difficulties with analytic software products which are well known to the visual analytics community: the learning curve, integration with desktop tools, and data importing. VZIN capabilities can be used directly from a variety of common software tools (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Lotus Notes, Analyst Notebook etc). VZIN leverages the capabilities of the ?host? application. For example VZIN for Microsoft Excel allows the user to extend advanced features within Excel so that thematic analysis and visualization can be performed on spreadsheet data. VZIN uses familiar interaction techniques which have become intuitive to users. For example; users of VZIN Desktop Tools for Windows can drag and drop files into VZIN, view the key themes and their relationships, and instruct VZIN to reorganize the files thematically.

Note:   THIS IS NOT  A PROCUREMENT.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 15 days from the publication date of this notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.     Such information will require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.     Respondent(s) will be notified of their selection as potential business partners based on initial diligence efforts.  Companies to be considered further will be asked to respond to a request for business case/plan within 30 days after the request is sent.   The request will contain specific selection criteria, including but not limited to plans for investment in product development, the marketing strategy for penetration into the market, as well as the revenue strategy and projected revenue stream related to this new technology and IP. Please send letters or emails of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) intend to procure on a sole-source basis with Johns Hopkins University School, George Comstock Center, 1302 Pennsylvania Ave., Hagerstown, MD  21742 for retrieval, DNA extraction, and data file preparation of 64 pancreatic cancer cases and 64 matched controls from their CLUE2 study (from the slogan, ?Give us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease?).  The NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortiums is forming a Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) to conduct a whole genome scan (WGS) of common genetic variants to identify genetic markers of susceptibility to pancreatic cancer.  Specifically, PanScan will analyze a dense set of the most common genetic variants in the human genome, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with sufficiently high enough minor allele frequencies (MAF > 5%). The panel of SNPs is based on an analysis of common SNPs in individuals of northern European background determined by the International HapMap Project and provides an opportunity to monitor tested and untested SNPs because of linkage disequilibrium in the genome.  It is estimated that the current panel of markers for a whole genome scan includes 550,000 SNPs and represents approximately 90% of all common SNPs in Caucasians. PanScan anticipates that SNPs highly likely to be markers for genetic variants related to pancreatic cancer risk will emerge from this analysis and lead to further studies of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions with pancreatic cancer risk factors, including known exposures and biomarkers collected on these individuals.  Individual cohort studies alone do not have adequate numbers of cases to be powered to observe associations if they exist, to investigate genetic susceptibilities for the WGS.  PanScan will include 1600-1900 incident pancreatic cancer cases and controls from 12 cohort studies.  One of the cohort studies participating in the PanScan consortium is the Johns Hopkins University, CLUE2 study conducted in Washington County, MD.  Blood was collected from ~18,000 CLUE2 participants in 1989 of whom 64 developed pancreatic cancer during follow-up to 2006. PanScan needs all the cohorts to contribute their cases including the CLUE2 cohort in order for the PanScan consortium study to be adequately powered.  We are requesting 64 pancreatic cancer cases and 64 matched controls with extracted DNA from CLUE 2 with acceptable quantity of DNA to be part of this consortium.  Johns Hopkins University is the only known source to the NCI researcher that has access to the samples from the CLUE2 study that is needed for the PanScan to be successful.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September  13, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is $6.5 million.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal & Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The University of Southern California (USC), 2250 Alcazar Street, Los Angeles, CA 90033 for DNA extraction, deparaffinization, bisulfite conversion, and MethyLight assays (at 5 loci) on approximately 250 samples.  Review of literature and analysis of data from the Polish study has demonstrated breast cancer risk factors and tumor characteristics vary by estrogen receptor (ER) status.  Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes, including the estrogen receptor (ER) gene (ESR1) and the progesterone receptor (PR) gene (PGR), has been associated with loss of expression.  However, studies that have assessed ESR1 and PGR gene methylation have been limited by small size, lack of population-defined sampling, and methylation assays that do not interrogate all relevant promoters.  Accordingly, the purpose of this procurement is to determine the percentage of breast cancers classified as ER negative that are associated with ESR1 and PGR gene methylation in the population-based Polish Breast Cancer Case-Control Study and to characterize which of the five promoters within the ER gene are methylated.  HREB will then estimate the prevalence of DNA methylation at promoter regions of ESR1 and PGR, and examine whether the breast cancer risk associated with reproductive, anthropometry, and hormonal factors differ by tumor subtypes defined by the methylation status of ESR1 and PGR promoter regions.    Dr. Peter Laird, an associate professor at University of Southern California School of Medicine, is world renowned for his expertise in the area of DNA methylation and cancer etiology.  The USC developed the methodology for the MethyLight assays to be employed in study objectives.  MethyLight is an accurate high-throughput methylation assay that utilizes fluorescence-based real-time PCR.  The assays differs from other methylation assays in that MethyLight is highly sensitive to low levels of methylation, is quantitative rather than qualitative, and is highly reproducible.  Given the large number of samples to be analyzed in this study, the high throughput aspect of the MethyLight assay will produce reliable quantitative measures of methylation at specific loci in a time.  The USC previously completed the initial pilot work on a set of samples with frozen tissues.   This project will compare the MethyLight results of the paired fixed tissues to those previously assayed frozen tissue samples.  Completing this project at the USC will provide the continuity in assay methodology to allow for comparison of paired frozen and fixed tissues.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing research experiments it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on September 7, 2006. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.

<DESC>This is the official Pre-Solicitiation Notice for RFI # NWS-001, a DOC/NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) procurement.  Please reference # NWS-001 on all correspondence.  The estimated release date of the solicitation is September 29, 2006.  The solicitation will be posted on FedBizOps.

DESCRIPTION:
The required engineering, technical, and operational support services are identified in five functional and programmatic areas:  system performance and effectiveness; documentation, publication, and communication; cost collection, analysis, and resource tracking; operational systems and program maintenance; and contract performance and cost management.  These contract support services for the development, collection, and analysis of decision-support data are critical to operations by allowing NWS decision makers to adjust and direct assets to meet its mission-oriented GPRA performance goals while being conscious of the cost to the American people.  There are not sufficient NWS personnel resources to perform these non-inherently governmental, commercially-available, management support services.

This combination of personnel allows NWS staff to focus its resources on policy, long-range planning, contract technical monitoring, and other inherently governmental activities.  Contractor support services provide the other necessary activities.  

NWS, Office of Systems Operations, will solicit proposals for engineering, technical and operational support services in support of the national mission.  The contractor shall provide a wide variety of engineering, technical and operational support personnel.


Engineering, technical, and operational support services must:

a.  Provide support for development, performance, and effectiveness of future architectures, systems and networks and their maintenance (e.g., weather radar, surface observing equipment, hazard/warning dissemination systems, radiosonde and atmospheric observing systems, and the central forecast and warning system); project management and contract administration support; and human resources staff support.

b.  Provide support to create and maintain technical documents, including test plans, technical manuals, modification notes, drawings, illustrations, schematics, flow charts, etc.  Publications and communications support tasks include the creation of briefings and outreach material; program presentations; weather graphics and web pages; and other presentation materials.

c.  Provide support in the formation of multi-year budgets; execution and tracking of the current-year NWS budget; development of budget strategies; collection and analysis of financial data, cost collection and estimating; development of detailed spending plans, cost tracking and reporting systems; development, operation, and maintenance of budget formulation data bases and tracking/variance reports.

d.  Provide support to NWS operational programs including facilities construction; engineering support and assistance, including field coordination; engineering assessments; analyses and investigations of system performance; creation, distribution, and installation of field modifications; preparation of maintenance and modification notes; and logistics analysis of current and future systems.

e.  Provide all aspects of contract performance management and cost to ensure task requirements are satisfied and task performance is provided at the most economical cost, consistent with the highest quality level.


The period of performance for this requirement will consist of a base period and 4 option years.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Time and date specified for receipt of offers is hereby extended indefinitely.  An amendment will be issued not later than September 1, 2006, to establish a new closing date for receipt of offers and identify revisions to the Announcement/SIR 1. --------------------------------------------------------------- Questions/Responses are provided as an attachment to this announcement. --------------------------------------------------------------- Amendment #A002 (attached) is issued to revise paragraph 2(b) by changing the number of full-time employees from 200 to 150 that vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneousley employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed for a period not less than one (1) year.  Time and date for receipt of offers is changed from August 18, 2006 to September 5, 2006.  It is anticipated that responses to questions will be posted Thursday, August 17, 2006. ------------------------------------------------------------ Since issuance of the Announcement/SIR No. 1 the FAA has received several questions from potential offerors seeking clarification.  Amendment #A001 (attached) to the Announcement/SIR No. 1 is issued extending the scheduled closing date for receipt of offers to August 18, 2006, in order to allow time for consideration of the questions and answers and associated changes.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement for engineering, computer, and administrative support services in support of power, navigational aids, communications, surveillance, and weather systems.  The requirement is predominantly for hardware and software engineering services involved in the acquisition, restoration, maintenance, and modification of ground-based NAS equipment throughout the United States and some overseas sites.  Contractor management and personnel will be based at the MMAC in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Requirements are defined further in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The current version of the PWS is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request No. 1 (SIR1).  Interested parties are also encouraged to visit the MMAC Home Page.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA."  A Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) type contract is anticipated for this acquisition.  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA. This requirement is offered to qualified, responsive, small business concerns through use of a "3-Tier" CASCADING ORDER OF PREFERENCE to determine the extent of eligible potential offerors.  Offers will be considered beginning with evaluation of Tier 1 and following with evaluations of Tiers 2 and 3, as necessary.  Tier 1 is relegated to screening of potential offerors from among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business (SEDB)/8(a) concerns limited to Area VI (AR, LA, NM, CO, OK, and TX).  Tier 2, if necessary, will consider nation-wide SEDB/8(a) firms.  Tier 3, if necessary, will consider nation-wide small business concerns.   The "3-Tier" process not only involves a determination of eligibility of the potential offerors at each tier, but also the number of eligible offerors from which the FAA can determine sufficient potential exists for adequate competition.  The existence of potential for adequate competition is defined as identification of at least six (6) competitive offerors from qualified, responsible business concerns at the tier under consideration from which it is anticipated that fair market prices can be obtained. If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified at Tier 1, then Tier 2 offerors will be considered.  If at least six (6) potential competitive offerors cannot be identified from both Tier 1 and Tier 2, Tier 3 offerors will be considered.   If a determination as to the potential for adequate competition cannot be made from Tiers 1 through 3, the FAA reserves the right to award a contract based on full and open competition.  Potential offeror(s) identified as qualified from screenings associated with Tiers 1 through 3 will be included when considering full and open competition.  The requirement will be re-announced on the FAA's website.   For purposes of this requirement, a Small Business is defined as follows: 1) Classified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services (Aerospace Equipment) - $25/million.   2) An eligible SEDB/8(a) small business concern expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the 8(a) program and which meets such criteria at the time of submission of the offer.   Should a SEDB/8(a) vendor propose a teaming arrangement, the term "vendor" applies to the prime contractor.   For those vendors contemplating entering into a joint venture please reference SBA website at http://www.sba.gov/ca/santa/sa_joint-venture_html.html.  While the FAA will be the approving authority in lieu of the SBA for any proposed joint ventures for this undertaking, the SBA standards for approving joint ventures will be employed.  All documentation to enter into a joint venture must be submitted with response to this SIR No. 1. Each firm claiming SEDB/8(a) status is required to provide a copy of its SBA 8(a) certification letter to the Contracting Officer with its response to this SIR1.  Offerors are to submit a FAA Business Declaration form with their response to this announcement.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility. In conjunction with the set-aside nature of the requirement, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  This requirement is found in AMS Clause 3.6.1-7, Limitation on Subcontracting.   This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this SIR1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this SIR1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  Documentation includes, but is not limited to, formal resumes, licenses, financial statements, work plans, etc.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  The 25-page limit only applies to the technical proposal (financial statements are exempt from the page limit of 25).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable). 	1.  Experience:   		(a) Document vendor's or predecessors experience with engineering and computer support services as identified in the attached PWS, Section 2, Areas of Effort, for ground-based National Airspace System (NAS) equipment or similar systems and equipment.  Note: A predecessor corporation is a corporation, which has existed in the past, has been replaced by a corporation which exists today, and for which a legal chain of successorship can be documented.  Mergers and acquisition activity accounts for such a predecessor-successor chain among corporations.  In evaluating experience of vendors whose experience was attributed to a pre-existing or through a previous company, any such experience will be considered.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information: (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone and FAX numbers for the  	Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government  	contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX  	numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 		(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate an ability to provide management and staffing commensurate with the demands of this requirement in the following areas: 		(a) Vendors must demonstrate that Contract Manager will be available at the time of contract award that meets the qualifications identified in the PWS.  Documentation as to individual qualification may include a brief synopsis or resume of work experience.  Resume should include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for similar services of scope and size (include duration or length of all experience), educational background, and training in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and technical or management competence. 		(b) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate that they have simultaneously employed and successfully administered, tracked, and managed 200 or more full-time employees for a period not less than one (1) year.  Documentation may include, but is not limited to: 1) a spreadsheet identified month by month for the annual period containing a list of employees and their managers, and the contracts on which they performed, 2) signed certification with a list of employees with date of employment including employees' managers and the manager's qualifications. 		(c) Vendors or predecessors must document/demonstrate successful recruitment capabilities and competitive employee benefits in order to recruit and retain a highly educated and skilled work force.   	3.  Accounting System and Financial Capability: 		Provide documentation that your company: 			(a) Currently has an "acceptable" job cost accounting system for cost-reimbursable type contracts according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) standards.  Identify your company's accounting system software package.  Provide the date of and the name of the DCAA field office performing the latest accounting systems audit.  Or, agree to obtain or develop a DCAA approved accounting system upon contract award at contractor's expense.  (Note: The FAA will not pay any vouchers from a newly installed system until the new system has been tested by DCAA.)  			(b) Has the financial capacity to support biweekly expenses in the minimum amount of $2,000,000.  (Note: Present contract biweekly voucher expenditures up to $2,000,000 are typical.)

Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release    September 06
Industry Day         September 06
RFP Release          October 06
Contract Award       May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions that have been received from potential contractors.  The responses to all questions will be posted as modifications to the Sources Sought Notice, so that all potential contractors will have the same information.

It should be remembered that this requirement is still in the planning stages.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Notice was to do market research to determine what sources are available to the Government.  No final decisions have been made regarding how this requirement will be solicited. 


1.	QUESTION:  In reviewing the Response Action Contract (RAC) Statement of Work (SOW), I did not see any mention of needing to respond to radiological contaminants/contamination.  Is there a radiological component to this Scope of Work?

RESPONSE:  Radiological work will likely be needed at a few of our mine sites.  
The work may involve work plan preparation, assessment, field sampling and analysis, and cleanup activities.  Work would have to follow regulatory guidance such as the radiation investigation protocols outlined in the ?Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual? (?MARSSIM?)  EPA 402-R-97-016/NUREG-1575 and  Multi-Agency Radiological Laboratory Analytical Protocols Manuall, NUREG-1576, EPA 402-B-004-001A,B,C, July 2004 (?MARLAP?).   

In addition, radiological technical expertise will be required for the review of documents, consolidation of data, determination of data gaps, proposal of studies to fill existing data gaps, and report writing.


2.	QUESTION:  Who is the incumbent contractor on the current Response Action Contract?

	RESPONSE:  CH2M HILL, INC.

3.	QUESTION: What criteria will the Government be looking at when determining if a potential contractor has the capability and capacity required to perform the work?

	RESPONSE:  The criteria to be used are listed below.   The Government?s evaluation of information received in response to this Sources Sought announcement will only be used to make a determination about whether a portion of Region 9?s RAC requirement should be set-aside.   This is not a solicitation.     

a.	Professional Qualifications:  Professional qualifications necessary for performance of the work required by the RAC Statement of Work as posted in this synopsis and in the EPA webpage shown in Modification No.1.  This would include such factors as education, experience, and certificates and licenses required to perform the work.

b.	Experience:  Demonstrated successful experience and technical competence in the various specialized types of work required by the RAC Statement of Work.

c.   	Capacity:  Capacity to provide available, experienced and fully trained personnel at the skill levels, disciplines, and quantities appropriate for the tasks in the RAC Statement of Work.

d.	Location:  Ability to maintain appropriate office and staff presence in Region 9.


The response date for this notice is hereby extended to September 15, 2006.

<DESC>The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) for renewal of membership services.  The membership provides the NRC with full participation in all North American Technical Center (NATC) and Information System and Occupational Exposure (ISOE) activities, technical reports, and software only available to member regulatory agencies in accordance with ISOE/NEA terms and conditions.  ISOE products include: 1) the annual ISOE report on ?Occupational Exposure at Nuclear Power Plants?; 2) a database that includes lessons learned for reduction of occupational exposures; 3) provide exposure trends by country, by reactor type, or by other criteria such as sister-unit grouping; 4) perform cost-benefit analysis; and 5) optimize ALARA objectives.  NEA is uniquely capable in providing this information.  The base period of performance is one year with one (1) one-year option.  The proposed contract action is for membership services for which the Government intends to enter into with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all capability statements received by October 1, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 813920.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This Request For Quotation is hereby amended as follows: Submission date and time are revised to read September 11, 2006, 2:00 P.M. EST (Washington, DC Time) in lieu of August 31, 2006, 2:00 P.M. EST (Washington, DC Time). The following technical question and answers  are incorporated for clarification: TECHNICAL QUESTIONS/ANSWERS: QUESTION 1. How shall we proceed? ANSWER:   It appears that 1.5 times 16 inches is equal to the 24 inch depth of the hood.  However, if you require additional space, please submit scale drawings of your normal opening mechanism so  that NEIC can evaluate your concern.  In theory, we have no problem making the antechamber slightly smaller but NEIC would have to evaluate how you plan to open the antechamber door. QUESTION 2. Is it possible to quote a fumehood that would accommodate this and you use the existing mehood for  another project.  We have concerns of doing an integration outside of the shop of this magnitude and not having all of our resources readily available? ANSWER: Unfortunately, you have to accommodate the presently installed hood.  Integration at our facility should not be a problem.  Please ask for  clarification if you have any questions or require any information about the existing hood that was absent from the solicitation. QUESTION 3. Can the diameter of the antechamber decrease?  If so what would be the minimum diameter? ANSWER: See number 1 above.  We will not accept more than a few  inches decrease in antechamber.  Any decrease would have to be justified by specific drawings.

The Card  Management System must provide all capabilities listed below: 1.  Provide workflow capabilities for enrollment, personalization, and issuance, and card management for FIPS 201-1 cmpliant PIV cards. 2.  Capture or record I-9 source documents (e.g. driver's license information). 3.  Record, export  and case-track NAC/NACI information as part of the PIV workflow. 4.  Provide separation of duties based on the HSPD-12 role-based model. a.  Have the capability to have a PIV Sponsor interface for the request for a PIV card as part of the CMS workflow. b.  Act as an authorized Registration  Authority (RA), performing certificate requests on behalf of a PIV applicant and loading these certiticates onto the PIV card during personalization. 5.  Natively provide ability to revoke digital certificate by contacting the Certificate Authority. 6.  Support workflow flexibility to match EPA  business environments.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5616   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; suotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Security Management Division intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the services of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Shared Service Provider (PKI SSP). Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 12 (HSPD-12) established policy for a common identification standard for Federal employees and certain contractors.  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1 implements the Directive by defining the overall technical requirements for Personal Identification Verification (PIV),  the foundation of the common identification standard or PIV card.  All Federal agencies, including EPA, must be fully PIV-compliant, including technical specifications, components and processes required for PIV interoperability, by October 27, 2006.  In order to meet the requirements and objectives  of HSPD-12 and FIPS 201-1, the Agency has initiated the EPA Personnel Access and Security System (EPASS).  This system will establish a compliant credentialing program that encompasses the full set of badge life cycle activites while enhancing the security of EPA employees and personnel, facilities  and Information Technology (IT) systems. One of the key components of the Agency's EPASS Badge (PIV Card) is the implementation of the FIPS 201-1 Authentication Certificate.  From September 2006 to October 2008 EPA will issue approximately 26,000 PIV Cards that will only require the Authentication  Certificate as described in FIPS 201-1.  Pricing for this implementation model should be geared to providing 6,000 Authentication Certificates with a three-year lifespan each six months during the two year timeframe listed above until complete.  EPA is not currently interested in any additional  certificates and requests.  Certification of the PKI SSP by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and placement by the General Services Administration (GSA) on the Approved Products List (APL) is required.  Pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) direction, all  procurements related to implementation of HSPD-12 must be made using GSA's Schedule 70 and the APL. The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible business whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most  advantageous to the government.  Any firm believing it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a quote, which if received by close of business September 11, 2006 will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Valen Wade, Contracting  Officer at wade.valen@epa.gov.

<DESC>AUGUST 30, 2006. THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN CANCELED.






THIS IS A COMPETITIVE SYNOPSIS WITH A SEPARATELY ISSUED SOLICITATION

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure services regarding The Review of NCI Thesaurus for OBO-Compliance and Training to Help NCI Achieve Compliance.  

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541512 and the business size standard is $23M.  

Introduction: The two major terminology products of the Electronic Vocabulary System (EVS) are the NCI Metathesaurus http://ncimeta.nic.nih.gov/ and the NCI Thesaurus http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/.  The tasks in the SOW are focused on the NCI Thesaurus.

NCI Thesaurus is a description logic concept based namespace that contains cancer-centric terminology.  It is primarily intended for use by applications to traverse vocabulary trees and the semantic relationships between and among concepts.  It provides the base semantics for NCI?s metadata infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR) and NCI?s data repository infrastructure (see http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caBIO). In addition it is used by NCI to index the NCI?s Web portal site (see http://cancer.gov); by NIH to construct concept vectors used by the NIH knowledge management system; by the cancer Bioinformatics Grid (see http://caBIG.nci.nih.gov) to provide terminology for the various activities; and by numerous scientific applications, across a growing number of domains that increasingly extend beyond cancer.  NCI Thesaurus is published monthly by the NCI under an open content license (see ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/ThesaurusTermsofUse.pdf). 

Scope:  Four (4) general activities are within scope of this SOW.  The first activity is a review and report of OBO criteria and relevant ISO standards for semantic quality and federation of terminologies as well as identifying and defining a set of goal requirements for semantic quality and consistency.  The second is review of the content and semantic structure of a small specified subset of NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical terminology produced by the NCI, for compliance with relevant International Standards Organization (ISO) standards; and for compliance with standards related to qualification as an open terminology under OBO; and for compliance with design and semantics criteria for federation with other OBO terminologies. The third activity includes documenting several clear examples of the modeling that would be needed to achieve compliance; this activity could draw on the work conducted in the second activity.  And the fourth activity includes training several NCI designated Editors or Quality Assurance staff to finish reviewing and editing the NCI Thesaurus for compliance.

Period of Performance:  Anticipated, thirty eight (38) weeks after initial award.  Only one award will be made. 

Solicitation:  Interested parties that wish to receive a copy of the solicitation must do so by the following:  The RFQ must be requested by electronic mail or by fax.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.   Request shall include name of the contractor, DUNS number, telephone and fax numbers, point of contact, business size standard, and identify the RFQ number RFQ-NCI-60100-NG on all correspondence.  The deadline of this synopsis is August 2, 2006 at 1 PM EST.  The estimated issue date of the solicitation is August 3, 2006 and the estimated due date is August18, 2006. Request for the RFQ shall be made to the attention of Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax 301-402-4513.  No collect calls will be accepted.

As a result of this modification the ordering period for this equipment will be extended to 31 December 2008.  The intended source is Talla-Com Industries located in Tallahassee, FL. Talla-Com is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the required amplifiers. These amplifiers are required for integration into the Joint Base Station (JBS) System that has been designed around the Talla-Com amplifier, as it was the only design able to meet all of the JBS System requirements at the time of the initial design. An industry review did not reveal any other products capable of meeting all of the Government?s requirements. Procuring amplifiers from an alternate source would cause the Government to incur costs associate with: nonrecurring engineering (NRE) to modify the current design of the JBS systems, labor and materials to build new mounts to replace the existing ones, test and validate the functionality of the alternative solution with the JBS systems, and logistics support to design new cases and drawings, recreate user documentation, revise training packages, and Configuration Management (CM) over a ten (10) year life cycle for these systems. For these reasons, only the TC-150M Multi-Band amplifiers are capable of fulfilling the Government requirements. This procurement is not set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code for this procurement is 334220 with a size standard of 750 employees. The reference number for this notice is N00421-06-T-0113. All inquiries should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Susan Supplee, via e-mail susan.supplee@navy.mil or via telephone at (301) 995-8899.  Interested parties may submit capability statements, by 13:00 Eastern Standard Time on 01 September 2006, via fax to (301) 995-8670 or via email to susan.supplee@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for electronic/written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.  The Social Security Administration?s (SSA) Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operation (OTSO) is seeking sources capable of providing a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution for a product that can encrypt data at rest in an Active Directory (AD) based, Windows Server 2003 environment.  Currently, SSA stores users? individual and shared data on individual Windows Server 2003 file servers located at over 1,500 field offices.  Most of these devices also function as AD domain controllers and DNS servers, and OTSO does not desire to encrypt the operating system or Active Directory.  It is preferred to have the capability to integrate with AD for establishing access to files and folders.  The data types include documents created using standard COTS productivity tools, such as Microsoft Office, as well as proprietary applications developed by SSA.  The data also includes various database types, including Oracle and Microsoft SQL.   In some server configurations, data is stored in external disk arrays, or SANs.  Most of the Windows Server 2003 file servers in the SSA environment have the data residing on 3 separate partitions defined on an internal RAID-5 SCSI disk array.  Current estimates regarding the number of servers to be encrypted range from 1,475 to 4,200 pending the evaluation of data types and locations.  Separate groups will manage day-to-day operations versus encryption policies, so solutions which include separation of management tasks are desired.  The following specifications are the minimum mandatory requirements, but do not constitute all requirements: 1) COTS solution; 2) NOT a customized solution; 3) A Windows-based or web-based configuration and management tool; 4) Redundancy for key management; 5) Redundancy for continuation of operation in the event of a lost communication link to central office; 6) Capability and tools to encrypt existing data during a data migration; 7) Robust key archive and recovery; 8) Encryption of data on tape ? or capability to backup encrypted data to tape using native Windows backup tools or Veritas Backup Exec; 9) No physical token or user intervention required for remote rebooting of systems; 10) Ability to restore encrypted data to an alternate device quickly; 11) Ability to control windows administrator access to data.  Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to clearly demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency requirements, above. Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules, other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC), or Open Market.  Pricing data is not required.  Respondents should refer to RFI-06-1011.  Only Electronic responses will be accepted and should be submitted by Friday, September 1, 2006.  Faxed information will not be accepted.  The size limitation for email attachments is 5 megabytes.  MS Word is the standard word processing software. A solicitation is not available; therefore, written and/ or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Requests for information will not be honored. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact the Contracting Specialist listed below by e-mail.

<DESC>The Comman Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Design, Development, Integration and Test Request for Information (RFI)is being re-issued due to ilegible narrative throughout the RFI initial submission. No informatio nal changes have been made to the following submission. The Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space on behalf of the United States Army is conducting a market survey to identify available technological solutions and approaches in support of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command Syste m (IBCS) and to obtain information on risk, capability and price. The IBCS Component concept provides for an IAMD Common Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (BMC4I) with Integrated Fire Control (IFC) hardware/sof tware product design, integration, and development that supports fielding of an IAMD Increment 2 Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in FY11.   	This notice is published in accordance with FAR Parts 10.002 and 15.201 and is a Request for Information (RFI) only in support of a market survey. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitat ion for Bids, Request for Proposal, or Request for Quotes. The Government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it. I.  IAMD PROGRAM OVERVIEW: The U.S. Army transformation calls for a network-centric system-of-systems capability (also referred to as Plug and Fight) that integrates all Air and Missile Defense (AMD) sensors, weapons (including launchers) and BMC4I.  This future IAMD System of Sys tems (SoS) architecture will enable the distributed support of engagements with available sensor assets not limited to system-centric organic sensors.  AMD materiel transformation, along with  other Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership an d Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) changes, will be conducted in increments of improved capability  through FY17. The IAMD Program represents a shift from a traditional system-centric weapon systems acquisition to a component-based acquisition approach.  This component-based acquisition approach will provide the most efficient way to acquire and integrate the componen ts of the incremental IAMD architectures.  Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the IAMD Program is structured to enable the development of an overarching net-centric capability wit h all participating AMD components functioning interdependently to provide total operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems.  The IAMD Program achieves this objective by establishing the incremental IAMD architecture and deve loping the following:  the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) that provides the common IAMD BMC4I capability, IFC Network capability to provide fire control connectivity and enabling distributed operations, and the Common Plug & Fight (P&F) Interface modifi cation kits that will enable weapon and sensors connectivity to the IFC network. Development of the component-unique part of the P&F Interfaces remains within the purview of the affected components project/product office. The IAMD Program will employ an evolutionary acquisition strategy consisting of multiple capability increments leading to an objective capability in FY17. This approach provides the opportunity for technology insertions into the program throughout each inc rement as high-payoff technologies mature and are ready for integration.  This enables an orderly and cost-effective migration from the current system-centric architecture to the IAMD net-centric architecture. The first increment, Increment 1, is being imp lemented by the User Community, primarily involving non-materiel changes as the basis for follow-on incremental capabilities.  Inc rement 2 is the focus of the IAMD Project Office. Increment 2 is structured to meet the emerging requirements for an integrated net-centric AMD capability by FY11.  This capability is supported by an early Risk Mitigation phase for advancing key enabling initiatives while concurrently developing the Incre ment 2 architecture. The desired end-state of the IAMD Increment 2 physical architecture, consisting of PATRIOT, Surface Launched Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (SLAMRAAM) Fire Unit, Advanced Sentinel, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD),  Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated and Netted Sensor System (JLENS), and Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) components working in an integrated manner via an IFC network to support the engagement of targets. The IFC Network will inc lude high bandwidth communications and integrated network management.  The IFC Network will be Joint Net Ready Key Performance Parameters (KPP) compliant and will support AMD Composite Battalion Task Force (TF) operations.  The IAMD Increment 2 will mainta in current force interfaces into Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAADC2) and will include new interfaces into Future Combat System (FCS), while maintaining connectivity to the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). Other Increment 2 significant capabilities consist of the following: 1) Common battle command and control using common open services and software, and common hardware; 2) Elevated (JLENS Systems Development and Demonstration (SDD)), and ground-based 360 r adars; 3) Integrated combat identification (CID) across the IFC Network and with Joint networks; 4) Networked AMD sensors with common track management enabling both situational awareness and fire control for Air Breathing Targets (ABTs), Unmanned Aerial Ve hicles (UAV), Cruise Missile (CM), and Ballistic Missiles (BM) threats; 5) Integrated fire control across IFC Network that allows for engage on network data using PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) 3, PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE), and/or SLAMRAAM  weapons; 6) Integrated engagement operations across an IFC Network that provides for  composite battalion TF battle management and engage on network data battle management: and 7) Integrated Force Operations / Engagement Operations (FO/EO) with collaborat ive planning and embedded training. The IAMD Program includes Increment 2 Systems Engineering, Integration and Test (SEI&T) activities and the development of enabling End Items (EIs) consisting of an IBCS Command Post (CP) and P&F Interface Modification Kits for applicable IAMD weapons and s ensor components. These EI products are built from modular hardware and software configuration items:  open architecture computing environment, IAMD common software, communications, common platforms, common shelters, and Command Center System (CCS). Common  configuration items will be evaluated and selected from Joint, other Services, and Army programs as applicable and feasible. The IAMD strategy is based on incremental consolidation and migration of BMC4I, weapons and sensor efforts using the international MEADS program and related PATRIOT-MEADS Combined Aggregate Program (CAP) extensions where appropriate.  The IAMD architecture  provides the underlying standards and protocols for the net-centric, P&F capability.  The IBCS CPs and P&F Interface Modification Kits will include Joint solutions (as made available) such as a Joint Track Manager (JTM) and a Common Data Link Interface (C DLI) manager.  Additionally, the IFC Network provides the framework to transfer fire control quality data over a high bandwidth communications channel between the IBCS and various weapons and sensors to prosecute engagements.  The Joint Tactical Radio Syst em (JTRS) is identified to fill the IFC Network communications capabilities.  Use of interim solutions in lieu of the Joint solution will be considered if the Joint solution does not meet near term milestones for developmen t or production. II.  IBCS Statement of Objectives       A.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) anticipates awarding a five-year, fixed rate, blanket purchase agreement (BPA) for logistical support services as outlined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) below. This notice is a Request For Information (RFI) ONLY. The purpose of this notice is to determine the interest of small businesses for this requirement. The EPA seeks responses to this notice from all types of small businesses including small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) businesses, woman-owned small businesses, hub zone businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, and other socioeconomic groups addressed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. EPA requests that industry review the logistical support requirements and address (a) and/or (b) below: (a)	Contractors with expertise in areas outlined in the PWS are invited to provide comments regarding the feasibility of the Government?s plan to use a BPA as the acquisition tool and the degree of interest that such a vehicle might generate, along with comments regarding other potential approaches.  (b)	Contractors with the capability of providing services defined in the PWS are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (max. 10 pages, excluding comments on (a) above) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirements. Responses are necessary to demonstrate capabilities/expertise in all aspects of the SOW and standard company brochures are not desired. Responses, including the contractor?s Small Business status should be submitted via e-mail or mailed to the addresses provided at the end of this document. EPA intends to review the comments and qualification statements from industry and reserves the right to issue a formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) for commercial services, as identified herein, using simplified acquisition procedures.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: NATIONAL SUPPPORT LOGISTIC SUPPORT SERVICES PURPOSE/ BACKGROUND  The purpose of the National Logistical Support Services Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is to provide logistical support to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) On-Scene Coordinators (OSCs) and other federal officials implementing EPA?s responsibilities.  EPA has recognized the critical need to have the ability to provide immediate housing accommodations, food services, communication capabilities, security, and other support services for personnel responding to emergency situations. Currently, U. S. EPA Region 6 (Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and 65 Tribes) and other Gulf Coast territories are the primary geographical areas for which these services are required. However, other U.S. EPA regions may utilize the services offered under this BPA when responding to an emergency.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires logistical support services for EPA employees and other support personnel during emergency response and/or Incidents of National Significance (INS). As essential personnel are deployed throughout the United States to areas devastated by disaster, without electricity, running water, sanitation, shelter, and other facilities for indefinite periods of time, sufficient logistical support services must be made available to ensure the safety and well-being of our response personnel.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION & REQUIREMENTS The contractor shall have the capability to provide logistical support services for a wide range of emergency situations. The contractor shall be required to provide any and all of the general services identified in this PWS. Any small business that is selected shall be subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting. Associated costs pertain to the mobilization and demobilization of any or all services, to include restoration of building and grounds. EPA shall provide a site specific purchase order upon activation of this agreement. When the specific incident occurs, EPA will issue a purchase order, under the BPA, as the tasking document to the contractor which provides incident specific details and mission requirements. The performance period for the BPA will be 2 to 5 years and the specialists shall be required to have a response time no greater than 24 hours. Under any resultant agreement or contract, the contractor shall have an electronic system that tracks all site specific costs expended and generate reports that document the costs related to their expenditures on that site. If a contractor does not have an electronic tracking system, they will be required to use a system EPA has established. The report shall be submitted to a designated individual on a weekly basis. EPA requests that contractors specify whether they have an electronic cost tracking system and the extent of its capabilities.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.  Although the set-aside block notes N/A, that has not been determined - there is a potential that this requirement may be set aside for small business.  I potentially have multiple upcoming requirements to provide furniture for a building at the USAF Academy currently undergoing renovation.  The requirement is anticipated to include executive furniture, conference room furniture, work stations, etc.  This is for brand name or equal acqusitions and your company must be able to provide all the products listed in the requirement.  The requirements are brand name products.  If you plan to participate in these acquisitions and have "equal" items please inform us that you have equal items.  If your company is interested in participating in these acquisitions you may email sandra.lynch-maldonado@usafa.af.mil and request copies of the lists of furniture.  In addition, the vendor may be required to store the furniture at their facility until the renovation is complete and the furniture can be set up accordingly, as the Academy may not be able to accomodate the storage.  DISCLAIMER:  It is important to note this is an UNFUNDED requirement at this time.  As such an award may not be made as a result of this inquiry. 

NOTE:  This is only an inquiry as to your interest, not a request for your proposal.  If interested in supplying this requirement, please reply back to my email no later than Tuesday, 5 Sep 06, 1200 p.m.  Please include your cage code and your federal tax IID number in your reply.

TASK BACKGROUND:  Since 1917, the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) has engaged in research and development, testing and evaluation in support of the nations defense while providing direct operational support to installations and deployed forces.  In rece nt years, the circumstances both nationally and internationally have changed.  Much of the technology that is necessary for the national defense is being developed by industry for the commercial marketplace. At the same time, many of the technologies and f acilities developed by APG activities have commercial value outside the defense industrial sector. Therefore, APG seeks to establish partnerships and other business agreements to gain access to the other emerging technologies it needs and to share the resu lts of APGs technology development efforts with the commercial sector.  The exchange of technologies and related business activities should stimulate economic growth on both a local and possibly a national level while enhancing APGs ability to support na tional defense. The APG Science and Technology Board shares a common Vision to serve as the focal point and gateway to APG for the entire surrounding region, enabling access to its technology resources, technical leadership, and applied technology base, he lping to foster and develop the APG and the surrounding region into a military, industrial, academic, a nd technology complex. 2.  TASK OBJECTIVES:  The primary objectives of the APG BDO are to:       2.1  Attract industry and other potential customers/partners to APG and satellite organizations such as DTC Test Centers and other APG tenant activities.       2.2  Act as the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to APG for the business community.       2.3  Provide the mechanism for the integrated pursuit of business opportunities by Tenant activities.       2.4  Maintain a database of core APG capabilities, competencies, and facilities.       2.5  Support official APG public affairs and public relations activities in an advisory role. 3. SCOPE OF WORK:  Contractor shall provide technical expertise needed to staff a fully functional APG Business Development Office (BDO). Services shall be performed on-site at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.  The government will furnish office space, utiliti es, telephones and telephone service, existing computers and fax machines.  Should contractor wish to upgrade computers and fax machines, it shall be at Contractor's expense.  A copier machine is not provided.  Should the contractor wish to have a copier m achine, it shall be at Contractor's expense.  The accomplishment of this task requires completion of the following subtasks:       3.1   Serve as the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for the BDO under the direct supervision of the Director for Business Development. Staff the BDO desk for phone calls/walk-ins. The contractor staff will respect the chain of command for all actions. If the contractor has an issue or complaint, the contractor will address those issues or complaints to the COR only. Contractual issues not resolved by the COR shall be elevated to the Contracting Officer.   	3.2   Facilitate ease of doing business by providing and maintaining a BDO website, maintaining a database of APG capabilities and capacities on the web page in a format that is readily available and accessible, and maintaining up to date information on g overnment technology transfer practices and regulations.       3.3   Create and distribute marketing support materials to create awareness of the BDO.  Coordinate enhancements to the BDOs World Wide Web page.  Promote APG capabilities and capacity via use of web page linkages, trade publications, symposia and c onference attendance. The Contracting Officers Representative (COR) or Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) will approve all materials prior to release/use.       3.4   Review and assess existing business relationships for additional business development opportunities and seek out and develop new relationships for business opportunities.       3.5   Promote APG Events, Showcases, Symposia, and other events.  Promotion shall take the form of developing original advertising ensuring placement of advertising in trade journals, Web sites, professional publications, news media, etc. and respond ing to questions from the public concerning said events. Development and continued refinement and updates to the BDO exhibit shall be commensurate with the showcase, symposia, etc. supported.          3.6   Support APG patent work by encouraging and providing technical guidance to potential patent holders on how to patent, and license, their products/inventions. Contractor shall insure that patents and licenses are marketed to the maximum extent p ossible at APG events.         3.7  Shall assist, when requested, APG tenant activities in BRAC related issues. This may include visits to BRAC impacted sites in an advisory/assistance role to the Garrison, Aberdeen Proving Ground (GAPG) to help transition those sites to APG.       3.8  Shall generate revenue for all APG tenant activities at a minimum equal to the amount contributed yearly by all APG tenant activities.  Revenue is defined as a return value or value added benefit to the government and is not strictly limited to actual dollar income.  Revenue may also inclu de the value of incoming technology, grant resources, and other areas in which the government receives a tangible return value.  The determination of the type and amount of revenue acceptable shall be made by the COR and COTR in conjunction with the APG te nant activity providing the funding.  Any disputes will be settled by the Contracting Officer.

<SUBJECT>66 -- AFFYMETRIX GENECHIPS
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source firm fixed priced  purchase order under a Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA for the acquisition of GeneChip Instrument System.  The reseach application of Affymetrix GeneChips requires that the chip be scanned on the Affymetrix Scanner 3000.  The image is displayed on a screen connected to the scanner and analog software generates a density number for each gene, to be used in the analysis.  The resource of detailed analysis is deemed critical to establishing the use of technology in our laboratories and adapting the analysis protocols to specific reseach applications. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued.  However, information received will be considered solely for information purposes only. This procurement is set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Beth West at llw5@cdc.gov.

<SUBJECT>A--Cooperative Partnership and Opportunity
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) Geologic Hazards Programs conducts basic and applied research for the nation on mitigating geohazard situations (e.g. slope creep, land slides and subsidence.)  Past practice for locating new pipelines and other construction has been to avoid locations where large ground displacements were possible.  However urbanization, environmental concerns, land ownership issues and incompatibility with existing land use along such routes are making such locations harder to find and utilize.  As a result, public and private entities needing to locate pipeline and other infrastructure will be utilizing route corridors where geohazards cannot be avoided.  This increased potential for damage brings with it the need to have better management and assessment tools to forecast and mitigate future losses. In support of this objective USGS is entering into a Cooperative Research & Development Agreement with DGH Consulting (DGHC) to develop specific assessment and informational material of interest to the pipeline community relating to ground subsidence and landslides.  DGHC will integrate USGS contributions with other information being developed by engineering and scientific contributors.  Funding for the guidance has been provided by Pipeline Research International (PRCI) and US Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.  This is not a procurement, the partner is contributing funds, equipment, or in-kind services to the joint research effort leveraging its efforts with those of the USGS for a mission related objective. For information on the science area contact, Rex L. Baum, (303) 273-8610; email: baum@usgs.gov or visit the Program website at http://landslides.usgs.gov/research/.

BFGL and immediate collaborators located at USDA, Roman L. Hruska Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Clay Center NE and The Fort Keough Livestock & Range Research Laboratory in Mile City, MT have a requirement to purchase services to catalog the full repertoires of genes expressed in the Bovine Transcriptome and ultimately seed the creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas.  This multi-institute initiative is supported by the USDA CSREES NRI award to grant proposal 2005-05011, which states the following objective Establish a high-quality bovine Gene Atlas that will have extensive utility for all studies in ruminant physiology, genetics and genomics including genome annotation.  The expression data that will create the initial foundation of the gene atlas will be generated using transcript profiles generated from the 100 tissues collected from the genome sequence cow and her offspring. The minimum requirements for this service include the capability and knowledge required to perform a custom gene expression service that maps the transcriptome content of cattle by a process that captures, simultaneously, all the cDNA signatures in a sample from a complex mixture of cDNA molecules derived from total RNA.  This process must deliver a count of all cDNA (from mRNA) in a sample, even those in low/rare abundance or genes that have yet to be discovered.  Base quality scores must be provided for all the sequences.  Precision and sensitivity of the methodology must be in the dynamic range of quantitative detection from less than one transcript per cell to 100,000 copies per cell.  At a minimum, 1,000,000 signature sequence tags must be generated from each of the 100 samples of total bovine RNA.  An overall total of 100 million signature sequences with a minimum length of 20 bp must be produced from all the different bovine RNA isolates.  Because of the rarity of some of the tissues samples, only 5 ug of total RNA will be supplied by the government for some samples. The service must include a partial bioinformatic analyses of the sequence information to help creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas (tag counts and identities).  All steps to produce these sequence tags must be assured by the quality control processes.  Samples must be tracked from project start to finish on a sample basis.  Data must be held in a secure database until accessed by secure FTP.  This includes virus protection, e-mail encryption, multiple firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure VPN technology, fingerprint scanners, and multiple tape storage systems to manage data security.  Sequencing of 100 million sequence tags must be concluded within 18 months.  All residual materials will be returned to our laboratories.

The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990. 

BACKGROUND

HIV surveillance among tuberculosis (TB) patients is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) as a key collaborative TB/HIV activity. In countries with generalized HIV epidemics, HIV testing is recommended as part of routine patient care, and it is recommended that routine care data be used for surveillance purposes. With minor modifications, additional funds, and human resources, existing TB surveillance infrastructure could be used to:
?X	Monitor the proportion of TB patients HIV tested, the proportion who test HIV-positive, and the success of referrals to ancillary services (e.g. PMTCT)
?X	Track the use of clinical services by HIV-infected TB patients [antiretroviral therapy (ART), cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT)]
?X	Monitor treatment outcomes of HIV-infected TB patients

CDC has developed training modules to improve surveillance activities for TB/HIV in developing countries.  These materials are targeted to district level TB and HIV staff, and include content on routine HIV testing of TB patients and HIV surveillance among TB patients (e.g. recording and reporting). The ??train-the-trainers?? format prepares participants to disseminate the curriculum of TB/HIV surveillance at the clinic/facility level. The course incorporates the ??teach back?? methodology to develop training skills of participants, thereby building future training capacity. 

A pilot test of these training materials was conducted in Botswana in July 2005. In their current format, the training materials are very specific to the Botswana country situation. Further revisions are needed to develop the TB/HIV surveillance training modules for generic use in other countries with high TB and HIV burdens.

PURPOSE

A vendor is needed who has: (a) Experience in writing TB training materials for the developing world setting (b) Extensive knowledge of the international guidelines for HIV testing of TB patients (c) Extensive knowledge of the international guidelines for general TB surveillance and HIV surveillance among TB patients (d) Strong background in the principles and guidelines for TB prevention and control (e) Experience in formatting training materials for user-friendliness and consistency.

SCOPE OF WORK

The vendor will modify existing TB/HIV surveillance materials to comply with international standards and guidelines for TB/HIV surveillance and routine HIV testing of TB patients. Botswana-specific materials will be amended to include global information on the TB and HIV burdens, including the modified WHO TB recording and reporting forms. 

TASKS

The vendor will assist CDC with activities necessary for the modification of the TB/HIV surveillance training materials by means of the following:

1)	Use international guidelines and standards to incorporate generic, general content into the existing Botswana curriculum, including a sample agenda, nine modules, and the supplemental adult learning materials
2)	Provide instructional design to standardize the flow and look of modules throughout the training manual
3)	Format materials for consistency, visual presentation, and user-friendliness, both in paper and electronic format
4)	Design a cover and spine, in color, to fit a 1-2 inch binder (200 copies)
5)	Digitally print 200 copies of a 250-300 page manual, using a two color process throughout for printing the training materials.  Copies should be 3-hole punched.
6)	Insert tabs/sub-tabs as appropriate using a four color process throughout the training manual
7)	Collate contents of each manual for delivery to CDC
8)	Collaborate with colleagues from CDC, World Health Organization (WHO), and other international partners to modify the manual
9)	Provide drafts of the manual to CDC, WHO, and other international partners for feedback.  Feedback will be incorporated into future drafts.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Preventiongenetics LLC, 3700 Downwind Drive Marshfield, WI 54449  For a continuation of the services being provided for The Office of Rare Diseases (ORD).  Preventiongenetics is the only known source capable of providing the required services because of his involvement in this project over the past months.  Further, inherent duplication of cost to the Government would be time and cost prohibiting.  Background:
Joubert syndrome (JS) is marked by ataxia, hypotonia, abnormal ocular movements, apraxia, neonatal respiratory anomalies, mental retardation. agenesis/hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis and a brain malformation known as the "molar tooth sign" (MTS) on cranial MRI. JS patients have substantial phenotypic variation. MTS is considered to be the most characteristic diagnostic feature. Some JS patients develop retinal dystrophy and/or progressive renal failure. For more information, see Parisi and Glass (Gene Reviews, www.cenetests.orc 2006).
JS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Researchers in several laboratories have identified mutations in the AHI1 gene as a cause of JS. AHII has 28 exons, the coding region begins in exon 3. About 40 different mutations have been identified in the AHI1 gene; none are particularly frequent. Additional cases of JS have also been linked to deletions in the NPHP1 gene and to two other unidentified genes located near 1 1p12- q13.3 and 9q34.3.
Statement of Work
This purchase order will establish the first clinically available testing for Joubert Syndrome. The strategy is a tiered approach to full sequencing of AHII and genotyping of (about) 3 STRP markers for analysis of the deletion associated with NPHPI. The first AHI1 tier will involve sequencing of the 12 exons previously shown to harbor mutations. If only one or no mutation is identified, the remaining exons will then be amplified. If no mutations are identified, then testing for the homozygous deletion of NPHPI will be performed.
Specifically, this particular test involves DNA sequencing of each AHI1 gene exon within the coding region along with -50 bases of non coding flanking DNA on each side. The test has two tiers. The first tier consists of the 12 exons in which mutations have been reported in the literature. If only zero or one mutations are found in the first tier, then testing continues with the second tier consisting of sequencing of the remaining exons. If a pair of likely causative mutations is not found within AHIL then a simple test for homozygous deletion of the entire NPHPI gene is performed by attempting the PCR amplification of several short tandem repeat polymorphisms within the commonly deleted region.
Candidates for this test are patients with symptoms consistent with JS and the family members of patients who have known mutations. Before testing, patients should first have a baseline neurological examination and brain MRI. If the molar tooth sign is clearly present and other symptoms of JS are present, then genetic testing is indicated. In addition to this full gene test, PreventionGenetics also offers targeted sequencing of known familial AHI1 mutations.
The prevalence of JS is approximately 1 in 100,000. From results reported in the literature, it is estimated that about 15% of JS patients with clear clinical signs will yield positive results with this test.
This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit  and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

However, all quotes received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government .

Identify the Agency, Contracting Activity and Requiring Office. The Office of Acquisition, Department of State is processing this acquisition at the request of Diplomatic Telecommunications Service  Program Office. 2.	Describe the action being approved. It is the intention of this contract to obtain material and installation services for 5 computer server racks with integrated 20KW UPS with N+1 redundancy, A (UPS) and B (building raw power) dual power distribution, interconnection wiring, cable management, to support DTSPO Enterprise Network Management System (ENMS) 3.  Describe the Supplies / Services required (including estimated value). This expansion of computer server rack capacity is required to support major renovations of computer server systems, including replacement of current ENMS software and hardware with a new suite of systems. The new racks will provide needed high power quality and cabling infrastructure for the high reliability requirement ENMS function. Our previous ad hoc acquisition of racks, UPS systems and cabling systems resulted in messy, difficult to manage layout with vulnerabilities to operator error (miscabling, loss of power,) and poor power quality. Cost is $57,995 including material, integration, installation and operator training.  Procurement is being awarded under a pre-competed Dept. of State BPA. -	2  4.	 Demonstrate that the proposed Contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authorities cited. APC is a manufacturer of UPS systems and also of rack systems. Other vendors manufacture some or no components, and simply bolt together components obtained from other manufacturers, resulting in a less integrated and reliable system. Most will rebrand UPS systems (frequently obtained from APC). Purchase approach of buying single-sourced integrated systems eliminates need for Government to do detailed design and integration of rack systems, saving labor cost and time and increasing system quality. 5.   Describe the results of any market survey conducted or the reason why  markets survey was not conducted. Market survey was made for similar integrated racks/UPS/power distribution/cable management system and none was found to be comparable in functionality or price.

"United States person" means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. (b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not: (1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or, (2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion.

Background:  

The US Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools (OSDFS) administers the Life Skills for State and Local Prisoners Program (84.255A).  This program is intended to provide financial assistance for establishing and operating programs designed to reduce recidivism through the development and improvement of life skills necessary for reintegration of adult prisoners into society.  Schools existing in correctional settings are in some ways similar and in some ways dissimilar to educational programs offered in community settings.   While the context and setting may be different, the instructional programs strive to develop knowledge, skills and abilities that enable members of their student bodies to achieve success, just as any other school.  These are public education programs and represent an ongoing investment of public funds.  Productivity and accountability are high priorities.   

Just as is the case with other public educational ventures, it is important to benchmark school performance, to make the performance of schools more readily apparent to all the publics that these schools serve, and to provide the information in a way that can facilitate efforts to improve school performance over time.   The Department seeks to assist State and local correctional education programs endeavoring to build or improve school accountability reporting systems.

<DESC>The purpose of this procurement is to provide the Department with support preparing accurate information in a useful form to be disseminated to grantees and other interested parties working with inmates.  The contractor will prepare a resource guide for use by inmates planning for post release educational participation (title to be determined).  This guide will be provided to State and local agencies so that they can customize it with local information and provide it to inmates as appropriate.  The guide will include introductory materials helpful to the inmate in reflecting on his/her educational status and goals, identification of types of programming relevant to that status and those goals, recommendations concerning where a formerly incarcerated person might obtain educational assessment and guidance post release, information on how various types of programs are normally funded and how a person might qualify for necessary support.  The guide will generally encourage individuals to set educational goals for life post release, provide information reinforcing the economic and personal benefits associated with advanced educational attainment, and offer simple and practical steps one might take to move toward participation in community based educational programs.  This activity, to be completed within one year after the award of the contract, is intended to assist ED to realize goals of the Life Skills for State and Local Prisoners Program (84.255A), which is the funding source.   The guide will be designed so that it can also be provided to inmates without local customization.

No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.

Background:  

Inmates enter prison with extensive educational needs that often cannot be fully addressed during the period of confinement.  The US Department of Education's Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools (OSDFS) administers the Life Skills for State and Local Prisoners Program (84.255A).  This program is intended to provide financial assistance for establishing and operating programs designed to reduce recidivism through the development and improvement of life skills necessary for reintegration of adult prisoners into society.  A primary area of focus is preparation to enter civilian employment upon release.  However, many inmates develop interests during their participation in institutional education programs that can be pursued post release - often involving higher employment aspirations.  

The Department provides rather extensive web based information to the general public on participation in higher education, especially as this relates to accessing federal student aid.  However, very few if any inmates have access to web based information.  Also, inmates need assistance negotiating the interface between adult basic education, alternative high school completion programs, occupational training programs, post secondary remedial education program and higher education.  Information on the various types of programs, for whom they may be appropriate, and the various access points to these various programs needs to be provided in clear language in and accessible format.  

Inmates who had not availed themselves of educational opportunities during their prior community status often have very limited information about accessing community based educational programs - where programs may be offered, where one would obtain specific information about these programs, what an application process might consist of, and what resources may be available to support participation.  

The organization of these various programs and their points and method of access varies considerably from area to area within our country.  For this reason, this product is designed primarily as a prototype to be customized, used and distributed by State and local providers of institutional educational services.  This is a technical assistance need that has been articulated by many grantees and which we expect to be welcomed and widely used.  Approximately 650,000 inmates are being released from State prisons each year.  Many times more are leaving local detention.

<DESC>Description:
High End Systems, Studio Command  

The HQ AFSVA at Randolph AFB wished to  purchase the Brand Name and items specified in the Description of Supplies.  This is a streamlined combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.

The NAICS Code is 423610; size standard 100 Employees.

IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c (1) , as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1-- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be in accordance with the following Description of Supplies: 

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES 

A.  Following items will be provided:

CLIN: 0001
Description:  High End System (#78010001), Command Studio 700 CMY Automated Wash Fixture W/Power Cord Lamps, MSR 700/2
Quantity:  Eleven (11)

B.	Delivery Address:		LACKLAND AFB TX 78236

C.  Delivery:  30 days of award

JUSTIFICATION:  

The upgrade would allow AFSVA the capability automatic switching power supply on all international voltages at 50 or 60 Hertz, replaces standard color wheels with two double wheels that can rotate to achieve continuous color mixing, includes a lamp power reduction for special applications, and the patented elliptical/spherical reflector system delivers an extraordinary gain in light output compared to systems in similar fixtures.  Additionally, Studio Spot can also serve as a DMX tester to view channel values and errors.  Substantial man-hours have been spent on training of personnel as well as costs incurred in the acquisition of the current lighting system.  In order for the primary control console to function as designed by the manufacturer no other manufacturer?s components will meet the Government?s requirement.  Failure to maintain system compatibility and interoperability with the High End system environment would introduce unknown product mixture malfunctions, complicate system configuration control, and void existing warranties.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

(End of provision)
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Steamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is LC06-LSC20060347 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The Gocernment reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussion on this procurement.  Award will be based on a best value determination, price and other factors considered.  The technical factors are weighted higher than price.
C.1	BACKGROUND

The Library of Congress seeks to acquire the services of a contractor to provide for the design, development, testing, and subsequent manufacture of custom shelf covers and side rests to be used in conjunction with the existing book stack shelving used in the Library?s Washington, D.C. Buildings.

	Overview
The Library of Congress (LC) collections include many valuable rare volumes that are currently stored in a book shelving stack system that was constructed as part of the building many years ago. The shelves used in this stack system are 29 ?? wide by 10? deep by ?? thick, and are supported by cast iron shelving uprights that extend through many floors of the existing buildings.  

	Since the existing stack systems were constructed as part of the buildings it is not practical to revise the shelving uprights.

	The Capitol Hill complex consists of three Library buildings, Jefferson, Adams, and Madison.  The Jefferson and Adams buildings have similar stack systems.

		Problem # 1 with the Existing Shelving System
The existing shelves were fabricated with a series of open flutes that run parallel with their length dimensions with ridges between the flutes being the surfaces that support the books.  When books are stored vertically on the existing shelves the covers of the books rest on a series of the ridges between the flutes instead of a smooth surface.  These ridges eventually create deformations in the edges of book covers.  The damage caused to books by these ridges is particularly significant with rare books, which have great value, and may have been on the same shelves for many years. Also, in the event of a water emergency the fluted shelves allow water from above to reach several levels of shelving thereby damaging more books.

	

	
C.1	BACKGROUND

Solution to Problem # 1
One potential solution to the problem of the ridges on the shelf top surfaces would be replace the shelves in the system with new shelves that would be constructed like modern library shelves with smooth top surfaces.  Since the existing shelves are efficiently designed from a structural standpoint it has been decided that it would be more cost effective to use sheet metal shelf covers that would fit over the existing shelves and provide smooth top surfaces for the books to rest on.  

	 	Problem # 2 with the Existing Shelving System
The second problem with the existing shelving system generally occurs at the left ends of the shelves where books in the collection come into contact with large protrusions that are part of cast iron shelving upright structure.  These protrusions place uneven pressure and deform the covers of the books with which they are in direct contact. These cast iron protrusions are a necessary part of the shelving structure, which support the shelves above the shelves where books come into contact with them.

		Solution to Problem Number 2
Since it is not possible to remove these cast iron protrusions, which extend about 1/2? into the space above the rear corners of each shelf, it has been decided that a side rest be designed that would take up approximately the last 5/8? of the left side of the shelf.  This side rest is to be 5? high and provide a side rest that the first book on the shelf can lean against, and which will prevent this first book from coming into contact with the cast iron protrusion discussed above.

C.2 	SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall complete the following phases of work to develop, design, and manufacture the shelf liners and side rests described above.

Conceptual drawings Q-101 (shelf cover) and Q-102 (side rest) are attached as an initial reference. These drawings are intended to show concept, approximate dimensions and usage.  Details relative to actual component dimensions are to be finalized in Phase l:  Design, development, and testing.

Phase I: Planning, Design and Prototype
Initial meeting
Contractor will have initial meeting on site to review the scope of project measure actual shelving to be covered, and confirm schedule of design, prototype, review, manufacturing schedule, and provide pricing for each shelf.   

Submission of Design
Contractor will submit three sets of drawings (two weeks after initial meeting) for each the shelf liner and side rest. Contractor will submit a list of materials used for the shelf liner and shelf rest including the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of all coating materials. The Library will have
two weeks to review and approve the drawings and provide feedback to the contractor.  
.  
Prototype
Contractor will complete preliminary prototypes of the shelf cover and the side rest that have been constructed and tested so as to determine that both items can provide the respective solution to the problems discussed in C.1 above. Contractor will complete additional prototypes as required to finalize the exact specifications for the shelf covers and the side rests before manufacture of these components can begin. Contractor must be available within five days to review any problems with the prototype on site at the Library of Congress.  

		Contractor will submit 5 final prototype shelf covers and 10 final prototype shelf ends to Library of Congress for written approval before manufacturing these components.  The Library will have five days to approve the 5 prototype shelf covers and 10 final prototype shelf ends and notify the contractor.  



Final Design Submission
		After final approval of the design, contractor shall provide AutoCAD generated files and 3 paper copies each of the design of the shelf cover and side rest to be deposited with the Library of Congress? Rare Book and Special Collections Division, its Conservation Division and with design consultant, Reese Dill. The Library of Congress will take responsibility for distributing the design submission among the parties listed above.
Phase II: Manufacturing
Upon approval of prototype the contractor must manufacture and deliver shelf covers and rests in accordance to the product requirements listed in Section C.3 .  The Library of Congress will have two weeks to approve the prototype.  If  the Library of Congress disapproves the prototype,  the contractor must provide new prototype at no cost to the Library with  three weeks.      

C.3	PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
C.3a	Shelf Cover
		Basic Construction 
The cover must be fabricated from a single blank of 20-gauge sheet steel.  The shelf cover is to be designed to fit over an existing shelf with slight springing of the cover required to get it positioned over the existing shelf before it springs back to a good fit over the shelf.  After a shelf cover has been positioned over an existing shelf the combination of the cover and the existing shelf must fit into any locations in the existing stack system where existing shelves of the same size are currently located.

		Finish: Powder Coating  
		All components are to be electrostatically dry powder coated with a thermo set finish. Baked enamel finish is not permitted. Color choice must be submitted to and approved by the Library of Congress. MSDS of coating material must be submitted form approval.

		Ease of Installation
		Since a large number of shelves will eventually be involved it must be easy for staff to fit the shelf cover to the existing shelves.  The exact dimensions of the shelf cover need to be refined to the point where covers can be easily placed on all shelves of the same type and the combination located in any of the shelf locations in the existing cast iron stack system with the side rests discussed below installed on both ends of the shelf cover.

		Workmanship
		All surfaces and edges must be polished, rounded, or finished to ensure smooth surfaces, corners and welds. Powder coating must be resistant to expected abrasion from installation and the routine retrieval and shelving of books. The contractor must inspect items before shipping to ensure uniform quality. 
 
C.3b	Side rest
		Basic Construction 
		Side rest: Fabricated from a single blank of 26-gauge steel sheet.
		The strength and rigidity of the side rest comes from its box shape plus the manner in which it leans against the cast iron upright of the stack system.  The bottom edge of the side rest must be extended and bent back so that it 
can be inserted under the shelf cover and provide a friction fit to keep the side rest in position.
C.3	PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS 
C.3b	Side rest

		Finish: Powder Coating

ONLINE ORDER ENTRY SOFTWARE FOR APFO IMAGERY ARCHIVE

PROJECT SUMMARY
In September 2005, USDA began providing metadata through APFO to Geospatial One Stop (GOS) in compliance with one of 12 Presidential Initiatives. Within the same time frame, APFO established web services specifically in support of GOS. Today, as a critical next step to expanding the value of its imagery archive and its capability to rapidly deliver imagery orders, the APFO has a requirement to integrate a web based online order entry process with the GOS and the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere). This expanded functionality will build upon the solid technology and infrastructure currently in place at the APFO, and leverage GOS as a primary entry point for all users. In the current production environment, APFO sales operations personnel determine coverage for customer requested orders quickly and efficiently by using their EarthWhere Data Provisioning System interface. This system leverages a powerful data catalog to locate all spatial imagery data within a given Area of Interest (AOI), enabling Sales Operations to process and deliver order requests in a fraction of the time required previously. It is APFO's intent to implement an easy-to-use Online Order Entry interface via a web enabled "Aerial Imagery Web Portal?, which extends this capability to external users, providing capabilities that do not currently exist and expanding availability to Federal, State and public customers. Customers would be able to gain access to the Order Entry System from the APFO home page on the web, Geospatial One Stop and any other web page with 
a link to the web portal. The APFO Online Order Entry web portal will take advantage of the existing APFO technical infrastructure which includes a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system data archive, the EarthWhere spatial data provisioning system, the APFO Work Order Entry System and the Media Services Production System.  As additional data sets are cataloged, the associated imagery or imagery products can easily be made available for ordering.
CAPABILITIES: The APFO Online Order Entry Software shall address the following capabilities: A. Order Entry -- Specify a county and order all NAIP quarter quadrants for that county, Specify a county and order an existing compressed county mosaic for that county, Limit the size of orders based upon APFO business rules; B. Order submittal -- Validate ordered products, Allow changes to orders, Save and retrieve orders and Submit orders; C. Order processing/delivery -- Provide capability to process orders according to size or requested media type. Orders are automatically processed and output via APFO media services; D. Order notification -- Notify customers when the status of their order changes; E. Account management -- Register users, Limit access to appropriate data and 
Enable and disable user accounts. 
SUMMARY: The APFO Online Order Entry Software will include: A. An Aerial Imagery Web Portal that can be accessed from the Geospatial One Stop, APFO home page, other USDA web sites, etc.; B. An easy-to-use web interface to order products from the APFO imagery archive; C. Integration with APFO media services for order processing and delivery; D. Ability to process orders based upon APFO business rules of access rights, file sizes, etc.

APFO ONLINE ORDER ENTRY SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The APFO requires a web based order entry software fully integrated with the Geospatial One Stop (GOS) and the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere). The software system shall be designed to enhance the value of APFO's imagery archive and it's capability to deliver imagery orders in a timely manner. In the current APFO production environment, access to the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere) is done mainly through its sales operations. By implementing an easy-to-use Online Order Entry interface via a web enabled Aerial Imagery Web Portal, the APFO can extend this capability to external users, providing capabilities that do not currently exist and expanding availability to Federal, State, and public customers. Processes and technology currently in place are well positioned for integration with order entry, but additional features required include: A. Support for debit and credit card order entry; B. Interfacing to the APFO Work Order Entry System (WOES); C. Thresholds for order size and data delivery options; D. Types of products to be made available for ordering; E. Provisioning and ingesting derivative products; and F. FGDC metadata for derivative products. The APFO Online Order Entry web portal will be based upon the existing APFO technical infrastructure which includes a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system data archive, the EarthWhere spatial data provisioning system, the APFO Work Order Entry System and the Media Services Production System. As additional data sets are cataloged, the associated imagery or imagery products can easily be made available for ordering.

ONLINE ORDER ENTRY CONSTRAINTS
When ordering products a user will be able to do the following: A. Specify a county and order all NAIP quarter quadrants for that county; B. Specify a county and order a compressed county mosaic for that county; C. Orders will be limited to three counties or a total output imagery size of 210GB, whichever comes first. 

FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN FOR APFO ONLINE ORDER ENTRY
Using a phase rollout approach, Online Order Entry will be made available to designated partners and selected FSA Service Centers. This initial group will pilot the new web portal, which will provide the APFO with necessary feedback to plan and prepare for a larger, phased rollout.

ORDER ENTRY: In Order Entry, users will sign into the system, search for products, add products to their order and proceed to checkout. The function to enter an order should include the following capabilities: 
1. Log into the Order Entry web portal. To place an order in APFO Online Order Entry a user must log in. The Order Entry system will have to validate the user's login credentials against both WOES and EarthWhere under the following rules: A. If the customer has a valid account, they can proceed to shop; B. If a customer does not exist, the system will allow them to enter the necessary details and pass this information along to the APFO for account setup. When their account has been set up, the system will notify them; C. If a customer has an account but the password has expired, they should have the ability to create a new password, based upon APFO business rules, or contact the APFO for help.
2. Upload a shape file to define an area of interest. The system will provide the following: A. The ability to search the APFO data catalog and return the results of the search to the customer; B. Define what data a user is authorized to see and only provide results that meet this criterion; C. The ability for a customer to validate that the products available within the AOI are what they want to order. D. The ability to add products within an AOI to a "shopping cart".
3. Search for products when no AOI exists. The system will provide the following: A. The ability for a user to define an AOI; B. The ability to search the APFO data catalog and return the results of the search to the customer; C. The ability for a user to validate that the products available within the AOI are what they want to order; D. The ability to add products within an AOI to a "shopping cart". 
4. Retrieve an order that was saved previously. If a customer saved an order in a previous session, they shall have the ability to retrieve the order in a later session.  
5. Proceed to "checkout" when shopping is complete. When a customer is done shopping, the system will allow them to proceed to "checkout", where they will have the ability to submit their order for processing and shipment. 

ORDER SUBMISSION: In order submission, the system will estimate the time to fulfill an order, price the order and present it to the user for review. Users will be able to review their order, change their order, save the order, cancel the order or submit it for processing and delivery. The function that enables users to submit an order should include the following capabilities:
1. Estimate time to process and order. The system will need to estimate the time required to process an order and have it ready for delivery. This will require an understanding of the HSM system and data structures, the EarthWhere provisioning system, WOES and the Media Services production system.
2. Estimate cost of order. This will require communicating information from the EarthWhere provisioning system to WOES.  Interfacing with WOES will be necessary for billing and reporting.
3. Present order for review and approval. The online order entry system will need the ability to present the details of an order for review by the customer before placing the order. The system shall provide the following: A. Allow the customer to add or remove products from an order; B. Allow the customer to save an order without submitting it, for retrieval at a later time; C. The ability to verify that funds are available for a billable order; D. The ability to interface with EarthWhere and WOES to create a work order; E. The ability to send an order submitted acknowledgement to the customer.

ORDER PROCESSING AND DELIVERY: The order entry system will have to integrate with the EarthWhere provisioning system and the HSM data archive to successfully process orders. The function that processes and delivers a customer's order should include the following capabilities:
1. Determine most efficient way to process order. The system should have the ability to analyze an order, determine the most efficient way to process it and then queue the job for processing. Some jobs may require special handling. 
Most jobs should be able to be processed automatically, without any special handling. The system shall provide the following: A. Based upon the size of an order and APFO business rules, determine if it should be output to CD, DVD or Firewire drive; B. Based upon the size of an order, determine if it can be placed in an automated queue or a manual queue for special handling by APFO delivery personnel.
2. Stage job for processing. The system will need to pass information between the EarthWhere provisioning system and the HSM system, as to what products are contained in an order, and then wait for the data to be staged before continuing with order processing.
3. Notify order has been processed. When an order has completed processing, it will need the ability to notify the customer that their order has been processed. If an order fails, internal notifications will be needed so APFO personnel can address the issue and complete the order processing and delivery.

CUSTOMER ACCOUNT CREATION: Customer accounts exist in both the EarthWhere and WOES systems. The function that allows customers to be registered so that they can shop in the online order entry system should provide the following capabilities: A. The ability to request and capture customer information so that APFO personnel can create a user account in their Work Order Entry System and in EarthWhere; B. The ability to add a group of customers in batch. An example of adding a group of users would be adding a group of FSA county GIS coordinators; C. The ability to identify new users and send a welcome message to them when their account has been created and activated.

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: The function that supports account management should provide the following capabilities: A. The ability to notify users within a group when new data has been ingested and is available in their area of interest. This will require an understanding of how the APFO Data Provisioning System organizes users, groups and the data sources they are allowed to see; B. The ability of the system to expire passwords based upon APFO business rules; C. The ability for a user to specify a new password provided their account has not been disabled; D. The ability to review customer accounts and disable them, based upon APFO business rules; E. The ability to review disabled customer accounts and enable them, based upon APFO business rules.

TRAINING AND SUPPORT: The Contractor shall provide training to specified APFO employees in the installation and operation of the software and its management tools. The Contractor shall provide support in the form of technical advise, software patches, and upgrades.  This shall be for an initial period of one (1) year, beginning at the date of installation.  Any subsequent maintenance will be addressed toward the end of the initial support period.

Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or simil ar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation f or Bids.  Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquis ition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor  voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 fro m I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 210 0 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main  Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commer cial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the v ehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain ac cess to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate gua rd that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of s ubcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane  except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully imple mented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmissi on Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any c ontract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lew is more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logisti cs Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participa tes in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history backg round check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CH BC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access ide ntification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Gover nment may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the cont ractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within th e required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he /she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, wit h or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcon tractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reprodu ction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not b e considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the  Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electr onic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

<DESC>Revised Scope of Work provided under this amendment in tandem with Questions and responses.  MMS responses shall be incorporated into any resultant contract agreement. Contact the Contracting Officer via email for additional attachments noted within this amendment. Danny.Lavergne@mms.gov SCANNING REQUIREMENTS REV 1 Financial Management (FM) Project Purpose The Indian Oil & Gas Project has evolved to provide improved maintenance and electronic access to all Federal and Indian oil and gas lease, agreement, and correspondence files.  The Indian Oil & Gas project, which is currently underway, involves the imaging and indexing of approximately 60,000 pages.  As the Indian project continues, Minerals Management Service (MMS) seeks to begin a second phase.  This phase will include all (both Federal and Indian) lease, agreement, and correspondence files plus deposit tickets and associated check stubs.  MMS will continue to evaluate the possibility of including additional FM file applications in subsequent phases. The work requested in this phase includes the document preparation, scanning, indexing, quality checking  and file preparation of all backlogged Indein records and all Federal records at MMS in order to support the aforementioned MMS Global 360?, (formerly ViewStar?) system.  This system will contain both active and terminated lease and agreement files, along with other files containing a variety of document types.   Agency Background MMS/MRM is an agency of the U.S. Government under the Department of the Interior (DOI). Its mission is to collect, account for, and disburse funds collected from private industry and other governmental agencies.  In so doing, the MMS/MRM manages extensive information systems covering historical property and fiscal data. A great deal of information is generated in historical record archiving of physical file folders through document image scanning. Scope of Work Scan and Index all existing MRM 'Federal Records' and the backlog of 'Indian Records' from November 1, 2004 to present.    Objectives These are the overall Project Objectives.  They are provided for background information/understanding.  All aspects of the SOW contribute to attaining these objectives. "	Support the Agency to fulfill its mission;  "	Achieve goal of physical record archiving by providing an electronic filing capability; "	Scan and index 90,000 physical folders containing documents and microfiche images, totaling approximately 500,000 pages and 250,000 microfiche images. "	Provide the images and indexes in a format that is suitable to import to our existing ETL (extract, transfer and load) process. Template and file attributes to be forthcoming. Benefits Imaging provides the following benefits: "	Improved retention of all record material "	Customer needs "	Easy retrieval and access to documentation for financial files, including on-site and off-site retrieval, by telecommuters and others "	Reduce/Eliminate lost or misfiled documents "	Reduce processing time "	Leases and Agreements are complex and oil and gas analysts rely entirely on the information contained in these files as well as other documentation.

Combined Synopsis/Solicitation 0206RP27956 Document Scanning and Indexing. Any conflicts between this amendment and the original Synopsis/Solicitation shall give precedence to the direction and guidance of this amendment. 1.	See Revised Statement of Work, entitled: "Scanning Requirements Rev 1 8-30-2006" 2.	Additions to Scope of work: a.	Due to all MMS records being involved in litigations, all documents shall be manually fed into scanners to reduce potential for damage. b.	Under SCANNING REQUIREMENTS  -Purpose Add a line to state as follows:   Scanning of records will occur on-site while indexing maybe done offsite by US Citizens under controlled conditions. c.	Contractors shall provide proof of citizenship for all personnel anticipated to be working under the project along with a list showing full names, birth dates and social security numbers.  Proof of citizenship documents are shown in the attachment labeled, "	LISTS OF ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTS." 3.	Estimated Magnitude of this project is between $250,000 to $500,000. 4.	Proposal due date is September 8, 2006. Proposals may be submitted via email in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat. Proposals shall be received by MMS not later than 3:00PM local time in Denver Colorado. The successful offeror will be required to provide original copies of the proposal and supporting documents prior to award. 5.	Lease space additional information: a.	Attached is a floor plan in Adobe Acrobat that is "representative" of the space available on the federal center. Space requirements and availability change over time at the Federal Center and actual floor plans of all available space is not available at this time. b.	Minimum space for lease depends on the current space available.  Bidders may assume a minimum of 2,000 usable space. c.	Any and all proposed construction build-out costs shall be borne by the successful offeror. d.	Space for the successful offeror, if not already positioned on site, will be leased through Minerals Management Service and ultimately through General Services Administration.  The total lease costs will be deducted from the firm fixed price bid cost for the scanning scope. e.	Successful offeror shall be available within 5 days from notice of award to arrange for selection of space.  Failure to adhere to this schedule will be cause for the government to terminate potential award. 6.	Q: "Does the fact we plan to propose the scanning be done on-site, but that the indexing will be done by (Vendor) coder's off-site make a difference as to how we should structure the hierarchy?" A: MMS only requires the contractor to confirm with the objectives and scope provided. Indexing may be done off-site in accordance with all contract documents including this amendment. 7.	Q: "What are the badging (PIV) requirements for access to the Federal Center?" A: Refer to attachment entitled, "IDENTIFICATION BADGE/BUILDING ACCESS CARDS".  Contractors are responsible for all the time needed for employees to obtain access badges. 8.	Q: "Is the information considered Public Trust data requiring background checks of the staff"?" A: Please see Citizen and badging requirements. 9.	Q: "Is the 60,000 pages references as ongoing work part of the 500,000 page objective?" A: The 60K reference is to work already completed.    500,000 is the current scope magnitude estimate. 10.	Q: "Is the contractor required to provide all hardware and software?" A: Contractor shall provide all hardware and software necessary to perform tasks noted in the scope. 11.	Q: "Is there a minimum number of past performance references required in the proposal?" A:	2 is required for review of past performance. 12.	Q: "Is there an incumbent contractor doing any of this now?" A: MMS has numerous small jobs and vendors providing scanning throughout the country.  This task is the first of this magnitude. 13.	Q: " Who will provide the QA on the imaging and indexing?" A: Contractor shall provide a QA plan and chain of custody plan as part of their technical proposal for review by MMS. 14.	Q: "Have acceptable Quality Levels been established?" A: MMS requires as a minimum that the copies be legible and of at least 300 dpi. 15.	Q: "What Volume of documents are on tissue paper? 2 sided? Highlight? A: This is unknown at this time. 16.	Q: "What is the quality of the Microfiche?" A: Microfiche done by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is of the highest quality. MMS though, does not make any representation of quality for those microfiche not completed by the NARA. 17.	Q: "will we be able to get network access to the internet? A: Contractors will not have access to MMS internal internet, nor will MMS provide such a service.  Contractors may subcontract for local internet service on site at their discretion.  18.	Q: "Will off-site indexing/QA be allowed?" A: Yes. 19.	Q: "page 2, the second paragraph states: The work requested in this phase includes the document preparation, scanning, indexing and development of all applications and systems necessary to provide a customized workflow and indexing application to support the aforementioned files on MMS' existing Global 360?, (formerly ViewStar?) system. This system will contain both active and terminated lease and agreement files, along with other files containing a variety of document types. This system will provide the capability to scan, index, retrieve and archive these records.  The above could be read to infer that the response should include an imaging system to work in conjunction with Global 360.  Please clarify." A: See item 1.e above 19: Q: "Are the deposit tickets 8.5x11 in size or smaller? If smaller, are they all a standard check size? If not, what size are they? 	A: There would be no deposit ticket scanning on this SOW.

IF SINGLE LINE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAJOR COMPONENT, SHIPPING DOCUMENTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SHIPPED WITHIN THE MAJOR COMPONENT. BIDS MUST BE VALID FOR 30 DAYS AFTER COMPETITION CLOSE. FOB DESTINATION CONUS GFMS will work in concert with the recently implemented Regional Financial Management System (RFMS) that uses the same COTS software and technical architecture. The same technical architecture is also used for the Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) project with USAID. GFMS requires an expansion to the existing Storage Area Network (SAN) development environment in BIMC and Charleston, SC to accommodate the increased volume of domestic financial data. The CFMS development environment is estimated to be 12 terabytes. This estimate includes the space required for primary storage for several development and test environments (e.g. development, integration, production simulation, etc.) as well as sufficient mirror backup copies.   Data must be fully mirrored to an existing Network Appliance secondary SAN to replicate the current 23x6  worldwide operation. Charleston currently supports 178 posts and Washington at the consolidated facility. Data must be continuously "mirrored" to secondary databases to support the high availability required by 23 hour per day operations, as well as reporting, backup and recovery without affecting online production. Likewise, the SAN must support high volumes of data updates from both batch and online sources and be able to "simulate" all key production storage operations. In order to debug performance issues, test new releases of operating system software, and ensure consistent operations support to production, the development SAN environment must be the same as the production SAN.  In addition, GFMS requires a second SAN for its corresponding COOP installation at the Beltsville, MD (BIMC) COOP site. BIMC already uses Network Appliance technology to support the COOP operations of a number of Bureaus including RM, AF, DS and WHA. This COOP SAN will be used to support the implementation of GFMS. Industry Data Both State and USAID have an extensive investment in Network Appliance SAN hardware and software technology. Network Appliance SAN hardware is used by State and USAID for the current production operations of the RFMS and Phoenix financial systems as well as the RFMS COOP site. The State Department has taken extensive advantage of the Network Appliance SAN software technology in the bureaus to support Network Appliance mirroring of bureau data to consolidated databases. Network Appliance SAN hardware/software technology is currently installed in IRM, DS, EUR, WHA, AF and RM and has been approved by the ITCCB (Ref # H-AS-NA-AS-0024). Network Appliance technology has also been adopted by the State Department's preferred database vendor (Oracle) as its own internal corporate SAN in one of the largest (several hundred terabytes) corporate SAN installations supporting Oracle's worldwide operations. The Impact of Not Requiring Brand Name The Department's financial system must be available worldwide on a 23 x 6  basis at the consolidated facility in Charleston, SC. (CONTINUED)  The Department has already deployed Network Appliance hardware for the production versions of RFMS that supports all overseas financial activity. GFMS will use the same technical architecture as RFMS and ultimately will be combined into a single database. The development environment that GFMS is built and tested in must be 100% compatible with production RFMS. This means the same release of software, the same ability to "mirror" databases, and the ability to test new releases of the Network Appliance operating system software before they are moved onto the production Network Appliance SAN.The Department is also in the midst of an important effort with USAID in the implementation of a Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) that consolidates both State and USAID on a common technical platform to be hosted by the State Department in the Financial Services Center in Charleston, SC. Again OMB is closely monitoring the progress of this initiative. USAID has already installed Network Appliance SAN hardware/software for their Phoenix financial system. The selection of different SAN by State would mean that State and USAID could not share common components within the JFMS Charleston technical environment, thus eliminating planned savings on software and hardware.   Recommendation Based on the current production installed base of Network Appliance SAN hardware/software and the critical need for the GFMS and JFMS projects to stay consistent with their production storage operations, RM recommends this one time acquisition (Brand Name Justification) of Network Appliance SAN hardware and software for the GFMS development environment and the GFMS COOP site.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 14-3K47-06 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08.   The Government intends to award a sole source contract to Solexa, Inc. Hayward, CA pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.3.   Inside delivery is required to FOB destination to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland, 20705-2350, within 18 months of award.  This solicitation is unrestricted.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services have been located that are capable of  satisfying  agency requirements.  BFGL and immediate collaborators located at USDA, Roman L. Hruska Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Clay Center NE and The Fort Keough Livestock & Range Research Laboratory in Mile City, MT have a requirement to purchase services to catalog the full repertoires of genes expressed in the Bovine Transcriptome and ultimately seed the creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas.  This multi-institute initiative is supported by the USDA CSREES NRI award to grant proposal 2005-05011, which states the following objective Establish a high-quality bovine Gene Atlas that will have extensive utility for all studies in ruminant physiology, genetics and genomics including genome annotation.  The expression data that will create the initial foundation of the gene atlas will be generated using transcript profiles generated from the 100 tissues collected from the genome sequence cow and her offspring. The minimum requirements for this service include the capability and knowledge required to perform a custom gene expression service that maps the transcriptome content of cattle by a process that captures, simultaneously, all the cDNA signatures in a sample from a complex mixture of cDNA molecules derived from total RNA.  This process must deliver a count of all cDNA (from mRNA) in a sample, even those in low/rare abundance or genes that have yet to be discovered.  Base quality scores must be provided for all the sequences.  Precision and sensitivity of the methodology must be in the dynamic range of quantitative detection from less than one transcript per cell to 100,000 copies per cell.  At a minimum, 1,000,000 signature sequence tags must be generated from each of the 100 samples of total bovine RNA.  An overall total of 100 million signature sequences with a minimum length of 20 bp must be produced from all the different bovine RNA isolates.  Because of the rarity of some of the tissues samples, only 5 ug of total RNA will be supplied by the government for some samples. The service must include a partial bioinformatic analyses of the sequence information to help creation of the Bovine Gene Atlas (tag counts and identities).  All steps to produce these sequence tags must be assured by the quality control processes.  Samples must be tracked from project start to finish on a sample basis.  Data must be held in a secure database until accessed by secure FTP.  This includes virus protection, e-mail encryption, multiple firewalls, intrusion detection systems, secure VPN technology, fingerprint scanners, and multiple tape storage systems to manage data security.  Sequencing of 100 million sequence tags must be concluded within 18 months.  All residual materials will be returned to our laboratories.

2.	Purpose of Project:  PBD 720 will eliminate all presentations personnel from MacDill AFB.  There will no longer be a team to provide presentation set-ups at the Base Theater.  A fixed projection system will expedite presentation capabilities for the average customer with minimal training.
3.	General Requirements:  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, product, materials, supervision, travel expenses, and services necessary to propose and install a high quality projection system into existing MacDill Base Theater.  *Note:  All contractors must conduct a site visit due to the age, size and complexity of the room and ceiling.
4.	Specific Requirements:
a.	Display System:  Install a 5500 lumens projector to rest upon the roof of the theaters auditorium entry to project on the existing screen.  Extra stabilization may be required to ensure secure support to the projector and ensure safety to customers.  The projector will be locked in place to prevent theft.
b.	Audio System:  The contractor shall not alter the existing audio functionality.  Audio sources will link directly into the existing audio rack.
c.	Control System:  A control panel will be installed into the existing vacant audio rack spaces on backstage right.  The control panel will power projector and select source input(video/composite).

d.	Lighting Control:  The scope of the audiovisual system will not include control of room lighting.
e.	Facility Concerns:  The theater is old and may require unknown specifications; therefore a site survey will be required by the contractor before a proposal can be submitted to ensure accuracy of the proposal.
f.	Cabling/Termination:  All control, video, and composite cabling will run from the projector into the ceiling and across the ceiling to the backstage right control panel.  Any visible cabling will be run through conduit.  For audio/video source connection to the control unit, a wall plate shall be installed directly below center stage on the front skirt.  The customer will be able to connect into the wall plate with all video/audio components.  From the wall plate, cabling will be run under the stage to the control panel or audio rack as needed.  Three XLR inputs will be needed in the wall plate along with a video input and composite input.
g.	Onsite Integration:  The contractor must ensure proper equipment function and connection capabilities via test for proper signal flow and custom control by the user. Upon completion of the entire system with final tests and adjustments for optimum equipment performance, the contractor shall provide training and documentation to primary operators and maintainers for daily use.  Training will include instruction and hands-on experience with the system.  Documentation will include as-built diagrams, specifications, designs, and manufacturers equipment manuals that will be assembled and delivered on the day of training.

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA)

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME:  Cisco Equipment


Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity

The requiring activity for this action is Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, ATTN: IMD CMR 402, APO AE 09180. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action

Requirement is for the purchase of Cisco wireless devices for the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) network fabric.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services

CISCO network equipment such as wireless LANs, antennas, line cords, WLAN controllers, and Crypto client licenses.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.

This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing LRMC Wireless upgrade program and will be an extension of previously purchased and installed equipment.  CISCO products are required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  In addition, LRMC network architecture is supported by the Tri-Service Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO). Cisco equipment is supported within the TIMPO sparing and maintenance inventory program for providing replacements and support world wide to MHS facilities. Current LRMC inventory investment of Cisco equipment is over 1.2 million dollars and totals over 250 devices. The LRMC site is 100% Cisco switches, routers and network equipment to provide component inter-operability. LRMC is currently running a Cisco proprietary VLAN protocol on the Cisco equipment, Non Cisco equipment will not inter-operate correctly with LRMC's current implementation of the VLAN protocol. Additionally, Cisco equipment meets DoD  FIPS 140-2 certification requirements.

All tools for management and managing equipment are specifically designed to support Cisco devices. Site personnel and system administrators are trained exclusively on Cisco equipment. Re-training of site personnel is cost prohibitive and is not justifiable. Continued purchase of Cisco equipment will save the European region over $30,000 dollars in re-training cost on new equipment. If LRMC receives non Cisco equipment, devices will not function or inter-op properly with current Cisco equipment and have the potential to sit idle as they will not furnish the site with the equipment required to provide continued health care to service men and women.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

A combined synopsis/solicitation will be released to FEDBIZOPPS.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

Price reasonableness will be determined based upon competition.

8.  Description of Market Research 

Market research indicates there are multiple resellers of CISCO equipment.  Research found the following companies:


InterNetwork Experts, 1955 Lakeway Dr. Ste 220, Lewisville, TX 75057, 469-549-3937, Contract Vehicle BPA W91RUS-05-A-0006

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431

The research that produced the overarching solution for the LRMC upgrade program included an evaluation of multiple technologies and equipment manufacturers.  These included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation considered the personal experiences of site personnel, a review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, a review of currently fielded equipment, and a review of GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations, an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO switch product line as the facility core layer, distribution layer and access layer switches.

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the LRMC area.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

Any reseller or wholesaler of these products will be eligible to compete such as:

InterNetwork Experts, 1955 Lakeway Dr. Ste 220, Lewisville, TX 75057, 469-549-3937, Contract Vehicle BPA W91RUS-05-A-0006

World Wide Technology, NAS5-02144, 60 Weldon Parkway, Saint Louis, MO 63043, 314-919-1431

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

None.  Market research determined there are resellers of these products.

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order.

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

14.  Section 508 Compliance

Required Section 508 documentation has been provided.

BRAND NAME DOCUMENTATION: Netflow Tracker from Crannog Software
(For Under $100K)

1.  Identify the activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 

The Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC), Information Management Division, located in Landstuhl Germany.

2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 

Netflow Tracker from Crannog-software company. The manufacture part numbers are NFTM 10000, Netflow Tracker ? 5 Devices Annual and NFT 1000, Netflow Tracker ? 5 Devices Annual. 

3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the limited sources acquisition.  Justify the use of limited sources due to Brand Name.

This software provides real time monitoring of Netflow data, harnessing flow information from Cisco IOS NetFlow and IPFIX, J-FLow, cflowd and sFlow, providing the LRMC network managers detailed network traffic information without the use of probes or additional appliances. 

Crannog software is the sole provider of Crannog Netflow Tracker and is based on the windows OS platform. Most other vendors utilize Unix or a Linux derivative and LRMC does not currently or plan to have Unix/Linux system administrators. It is not cost effective to hire and retain a Unix system administrator for one application, as all other LRMC applications that we support are based on the Windows based OS and current personnel are presently fully trained to utilize this OS. 

4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for sole source procurement?

The requirement to capture full NetFlow / IPFIX traffic information, allowing significant in-depth application and protocol information analysis to take place including user, server and applications activity was identified in conjunction with the ongoing wireless and VoIP initiative. Traffic views by user, user group, conversation, system and application that is suitable for security, QoS, traffic analysis requirements is essential for the successful deployment of these two systems. 

If this application is not purchased in a timely manner, both the wireless and VoIP initiative will face a difficult, if not impossible task of succeeding. This software tool is essential to the correct configuration and initialization of the devices that the wireless and VoIP systems will run on.

The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, considering technical factors and price.  The following technical factors will be evaluated and are listed in descending order of importance:
 
(1)  Technical Approach 
(2)	 Past Experience/Performance.     

Technical Approach:     
Technical proposal shall be no longer than 6 typed pages (12pt font), excluding pictures, illustrations,  drawings, and copy of AvL quote.  It must include a detailed description of the product and all of its capabilities.  It must include an overview of similar systems and some of the customers using them.  It must include pictures of the system, single line drawings, and similar systems.  A copy of Avl?s quote (price may be deleted) is required to ensure all of the features of the special NAVAIR version are being provided.   It must describe your knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements and identify the methodology and analytical techniques you will use to manage the work and ensure that all SOW requirements are met.  Offers will be evaluated on the demonstrated ability to provide a technical approach that integrates the tasking into a cohesive effort that can be accomplished with minimal risk.   

Required Past Experience/Performance Documentation:
The offeror shall provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks as required by this SOW and at least two (2) years of experience producing similar products within the past three (3) years.  If the offeror will subcontract any significant part of this effort, the offeror must provide a narrative of at least two (2) projects for similar tasks for those subcontractors.  The offeror shall provide applicable contractor names, contract numbers, contract dollar values, description of product provided, and periods of performance.  Each narrative shall also include the name, area code and phone number, mailing and e-mail address of the person from each identified contractor who can verify the offerors past experience/ performance.  The Past Experience/Performance Documentation shall be no longer than 3 typed pages (12pt font).  The Government will conduct reference checks on performance, customer satisfaction with respect to technical quality of product provided, ability to meet contractual schedules, management responsiveness, and cost control.  The Government will also evaluate the relevance of the offeror's past experience/performance compared to the requirements specified in the SOW.  The Government may supplement the information you provide with performance information it may obtain from any other reliable source including its own experience with your firm (or Subcontractor).  Offerors unable to fully demonstrate they have successfully completed two (2) similar tasks to this SOW in the past three (3) years will be considered to be a higher risk to the Government and as a result may not be considered for award.	

The technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, to the extent that the offers become more equal in the technical and past performance factors, then price takes on added significance.
