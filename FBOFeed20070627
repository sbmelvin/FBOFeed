NO COMPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, E-Mail Division (IRM/OPS/MSO/EML).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for Hewlett Packard components.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements for Department of State Infrastructure interoperability and connectivity with mission critical communications systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Hewlett Packard products as a key component of the Department’s core Microsoft Exchange E-Mail infrastructure on OpenNet and ClassNet.  The equipment listed above is required to support continuing operations of the Department’s Enterprise E-Mail systems.  The current Hewlett Packard server systems form the core infrastructure for worldwide message routing for all Department users and for Central Site mailbox storage for over 14,000 Domestic user mailboxes.  This acquisition will allow the MSO to support the Department’s IRM Bureau consolidation efforts and provide storage for 40,000 Domestic users (25,000 on OpenNet and 15,000 on ClassNet).  This will also enable MSO to provide increased storage space for users – 500 MB mailboxes vs. current mailbox size for users, which is restricted to 100 MB> The 41USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core Microsoft Exchange E-mail infrastructure.  Hewlett Packard provided hardware, software, and services provide support for current core E-Mail Operations functions of worldwide message routing and Central Site mailbox storage.  Hewlett Packard systems are tightly integrated with Microsoft Exchange and integrate seamlessly into the Department’s networking infrastructure. Therefore, EML personnel have a thorough understanding of operations and maintaining Microsoft Exchange on Hewlett Packard servers.  Acquisition of servers from any other supplier would involve substantial risk in the areas of quality and continuity of operations, cost for maintaining current operations, and schedule for deployment of Central Site consolidation capabilities. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid. The Department’s operational Microsoft Exchange E-mail infrastructure is a Hewlett Packard environment and any deviations from the Hewlett Packard components and support would pose substantial operational risk that could interrupt the availability E-Mail for Department of State employees.  The goal of the IRM/OPS/MSO/EML is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where standardized resources are available to provide services to end users under normal conditions and in the event of a disaster.  Hewlett Packard products, maintenance, and support are critical for continuing normal and contingency off-site message routing and mailbox storage operations on ClassNet and OpenNet. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition. This is an urgently needed, highly-specialized, best-fit requirement, based upon prior utilization of Hewlett Packard products, maintenance, and support. In the event that this request is not approved, IRM/OPS/MSO/EML will not be able to support worldwide messaging on OpenNet and ClassNet for the Department of State, and IRM’s Domestic E-Mail consolidation and migration efforts cannot go forward.<BR><BR>

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval on a brand name ony basis is for the use of the Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State (DOS) infrastructure connectivity requirements and USG Agency interoperability, thereby precluding consideration fo the products of other companies. The office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST) of the Department s bureau of Consular Affairs requires the purchase of the scanners referenced for the Bureau’s worldwide 10 print fingerprint capture initiative, which will begin in July 2007 and must be completed by the end of calendar year 2007.  The Homeland Security Council decided on June 7, 2005 that the USG standard for biometric screening of foreign nationals coming into the US should transition from two fingerprints to ten fingerprints to enable the two major USG fingerprint systems, the DHS IDENT system and the FBI IAFIS system, to establish interoperability.The transition to ten prints also will enable the Bureau of Consular Affairs to clear visa applicants’ fingerprints against the FBI IAFIS system, which in turn will allow consularoficers to more effectively screen out applicants who are ineligible due to criminal history records.  Consular officers eventually will be relieved of the task of reviewing long lists of non-exact NCIII name results to determine if an applicant may have a criminal history record.  DHS/CBP also is moving to ten-print collection at the ports of entry, expecting to deploy by 2008.<BR><BR>The 10 print capture initiatives will ensure that the DOS fully complies with section 303 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform act of 2002. CA Requires that any scanner selected for the pilot must meet the following software compatibility requirements: 1) The scanner must be able to function as a replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 Check fingerprint scanner and as an alternative to the Cross Match Guardian fingerprint scanner. 2) The scanner must meet FBI EFTS certification requirements 3) The scanner must have an API (application programming interface) available for integration into custom applications such as TPLS (Ten Print Live Scan) In Summation, CA/CST maintains that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 1400 fingerprint scanners without delay so that the Department’s worldwide implementation and use of the 10 print fingerprint capture system modules may commence as scheduled in July 2007 and be completed by the end of calendar 2007. The 41 USC 253 ( C ) ( 1 ) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items to meet the Department’s requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Space Radiation Transport: Code Comparisons and Spatial Variations comparing several different radiation transport models in space radiation environments, and studying the variation of radiation hazard inside three-dimensional (3-D) geometries.  Project deliverables: Perform comparisons of the scientific results from several selected radiation transport codes; document the simulations and analysis in brief reports and/or submission for journal publications. Prepare a manuscript for journal publication on the study of variations of the space radiation hazard within 3-D geometries. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase special studies and analysis from East Carolina University. The capability to perform such proposed analysis requires a demonstrated competence in the use and modification of the radiation shielding model, various ambient radiation models, and secondary radiation models. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  This capability is needed to predict problems, analyze problems where they occur, and to modify the transport programs being studied. Dr. Lin, the principal investigator, has worked for several years in the Radiation Transport Consortium. During this effort Dr. Lin has developed unique capabilities and understanding of the transport programs being studied. The range of expertise and experience required prevent the use of other sources. 2. To develop the expertise from other sources would require additional funding.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Thursday, July 12, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The FAA intends to award an extension to contract DTFACT-04-C-00003 with Galaxy Scientific/SRA.  The FAA has issued the above contract in support of the Transportation Security Labs (TSL) to support services needed to conduct independent verification and validation (IV&V) to qualify Advanced Technology (AT) detection systems for baggage inspection systems supporting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). TSA has an urgent need to conduct additional qualification tests of the AT systems.  A break in service will cause delays in security equipment deployments.  The proposed action must be awarded by mid-July and is expected to require not more than 3,500 labor hours spanning less than 120 days. For another source to provide equivalent, effective and efficient support, it would require a minimum of 4 to 6 months before the level of expertise could be obtained by another company.   The cost of using another source would require more than 7,000 hours delivering the same level of quality services, if the test staff were immediately available and coordinated.  Schedule risk would be rated high and the impact of an incomplete or delayed test report to support a TSA procurement decision would significantly delay deployment of security equipment at airports. TSL intends to issue a solicitation of at least $2M using pre-qualified sources identified in the DHS/EAGLE program.

Sole Source Justification:

MATLAB is a standard mathematical research tool in wide use throughout the scientific, government, and academic communities. AFRL/IFGC requires this software to enable scientific research exchange, collaboration, and peer review among these communities. In-house government researchers utilize MATLAB when prototyping new research ideas. Prior research, the foundation for much new research and development, was conducted with MATLAB prototypes. MATLAB software is proprietary to and solely distributed by The MathWorks Inc. Therefore Mathworks is the sole responsible source for this requirement.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with ETS Lindgren LP, 1301 Arrow Point Drive, Cedar Park TX 78613-6936 for twelve (12) Dual Polarized Log Periodic Array (LPDA) antennas. These antennas are being purchased as part of an experimental portable radar system. The antennas will be mounted on crankup towers for a tomographic ring of RF sensors.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

Sole Source Justification

AFRL/SNRT requires the LPDA antennas to be compatible with the existing inventory of antennas of the same model and type. SNRT already possesses replacement parts of the same model as currently required. If a different antenna model were purchased, the Government would require not only a complete set of antenna units but also a new cache of parts to facilitate upkeep of the new antennas. Analysis showed that the total cost to augment and replace the existing antenna units with lower cost units and their associated maintenance parts exceeds the cost to augment the existing inventory with units of the same type. In any event, ETS Lindgren is the only source that can provide antennas that are compatible with the existing inventory. No other antennas could suffice since the experiment requires identical antennas for interchangeability between transmit and receive on the tomographic ring.

Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate. 

FACTOR 1. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND CAPABILITIES:  

The Government will evaluate the firm?s demonstrated capability of the firm and key personnel in hydrology, open channel hydraulics, and coastal analysis and design for the purposes of flood risk assessment and floodplain maps as well as their demonstrated integration of engineering and geographic Information systems (GIS) staff in mapping project implementation.

The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in management, quality assurance planning and quality control reviews in similar projects; capability for quality oversight and assurance for work performed by other contractors and federal, state, and local entities; capability and general approach to developing a quality assurance and surveillance plan that reflects the performance standards and incentives tied to the Statement of Objectives; and ability to build effective partnerships between various levels of government, the public and the private sector.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s experience in Earned Value Management in managing cost, schedule, and performance.  

FACTOR 3.  PAST PERFORMANCE IN CONTRACTS WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF COST CONTROL, QUALITY OF WORK, AND COMPLIANCE WITH PERFORMANCE SCHEDULES.  
The Government will evaluate the firm?s past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry will be evaluated in terms of project management, accuracy of costs estimates, cost control, quality control, completion of projects within budget, and compliance with performance schedules for contracts of a similar type, size and scope.

The Government reserves the right to use information outside of the response in evaluating past performance.

FACTOR 4. CAPACITY TO ACCOMPLISH THE WORK IN THE REQUIRED TIME.  
The government will evaluate the firm's ability to perform multiple complex projects, in multiple states concurrently, while accomplishing the work within required time limits.

Market Survey for Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Support for Secondary Items that support the AN/PVS-7D, AN/PVS-14 and AN/AVS-6 Night Vision Goggles (NVGs). * Disclaimer: This Market Research is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a solicitation, RFP, or an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. This is only an e stimate and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by  the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.The intent of this market survey is to identify market interest, potential sources of supply for full implementation of PBL support ,and solicit recommendation as to how best perform the sustainment of the identified materiel. This market survey is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease sustainment costs, improve sustainment efficiency, and increase sustainme nt readiness for all customers. The intent is for the source of supply to provision, stock, store and ship ready for issue equipment directly to users upon demand while meeting and maintaining performance requirements in accordance with the terms of the co ntract and government approved technical data and technical manuals. The PBL contractor will be responsible for determining requirements to support demand forecasts. The PBL contractor will utilize best commercial and/or business practices while teaming wi th the Government and implement a program that is transparent to all customers. Information gathered through this market survey could be used to aid in the definition and refinement of requirements for the secondary item supply support for the night vision  goggles, AN/PVS-7D, AN/PVS-14 and AN/AVS-6.  Potential uses for the information received may include development of requirements packages and possible future solicitations.  Additionally, the Government seeks input on the data required to effectively esti mate demand forecast, cost, and performance measurements.The PBL arrangement will have a supply support sustainment focus, and will make the supplier accountable through a series of performance metrics. Performance metrics will measure the effectiveness an d efficiency of the supply chain. The metrics requirements will be incorporated into the contract and offer increased challenges over the contract period. The supplier will be responsible for their supply chain management (to include forecasting, purchasin g, inventory, and transportation). In addition, we need to define supplier capability to interface with Army inventory management systems in order for the supplier to receive and process requisitions and maintain a requisition status tracking and reporting  system.This will be a 10 year effort. The PBL contract may be awarded by individual system or multiple combinations thereof and will contain cash incentive clauses based on performance metrics. The Government will maintain ownership of wholesale and retai l inventory. The PBL contractor shall be accountable for the storage and management of the wholesale inventory using the Contractors inventory management processes. The supply support arrangement will involve sustainment for approximately 500,000 at CONUS  and OCONUS locations.It is crucial that any interested sources identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, by responding to this survey. Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 27 July 2007, to C-E LCMC I EW/S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Susan F. Weir), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

<DESC>NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result in the award of approximately six (6) to eight (8) multiple-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) General Construction Contracts.  However, the Government reserves the right to award as many or as few as deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.  It is anticipated, that these IDIQ contracts will have a one-year base period of performance and four (4) one-year option periods.  The contracts will have IDIQ ordering provisions under which the Government may award Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for general construction requirements.  Under the delivery orders, the contractor will be required to furnish all management, labor, equipment, and/or materials necessary for the performance of construction, modification, repair, and/or rehabilitation of facilities located onsite at MSFC, or operated by MSFC. The specific work requirements will be included in the delivery orders.  The IDIQ contracts will not be "requirements contracts" and therefore the Government may, at its sole discretion, utilize other procurements to satisfy its general construction requirements.   Under the ordering provisions of the proposed IDIQ contracts, the Government may utilize competitive or noncompetitive procurement procedures to solicit future delivery order bids from the IDIQ contractors.  Bids will generally be solicited from all of the IDIQ contractors on a competitive basis.  It is estimated that 20 to 30 delivery orders with a total combined price of $2.5 million will be awarded annually.	The estimated price range of the delivery orders will be between $25,000 and $2.5 million.  The anticipated maximum IDIQ value for each contract will be $25M.  This amount represents the maximum cumulative value of the delivery orders the Government may award under each IDIQ contract. The RFP will include specifications and drawings for a delivery order (for a sample construction project) that will be subject to award to one of the selected IDIQ contractors.  The decision to award or not award the delivery order is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The delivery order will be representative in nature of the tasks to be ordered under the proposed IDIQ general construction contracts.  Offerors will be required to submit a price proposal for the delivery order as part of its proposal for the IDIQ contracts.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Division (NAVAIR AD) intends to issue a Sole Source, Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) purchase order with PBM Associates, Inc. for Quality Assurance (QA) technical training and related documentation for NAVAIR PMA-231 QA personnel using the modified Standard Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETMs) Viewer (NSIV).  These IETMs can only be accurately viewed using a NSIV.  PBM Associates, Inc. is the only known source with the technical knowledge necessary to train the Government on the use of the modified NSIV because it is the company performing the modifications to the NSIV.   The training course is critical to ensure PMA-231 QA personnel gain the necessary skills to perform a QA review of data received from the conversion sources and the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).  Additionally, once the training and modification of the NSIV have been completed, PMA-231 QA personnel will immediately apply the QA review process to reduce the backlog of IETMs awaiting a quality control check.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 611430 and the Federal Supply Class (FSC) Code for this requirement is U099.   The closing date for this synopsis is 12 July 2007.

<DESC>*Pre-Solicitation Notice Synopsis*

This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only OCEANEERING INTERNATIONAL INC, 7001 DORSEY ROAD, HANOVER, MD 21076-1553, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. 

The Prototype Geotechnical Tool Kit (PGTK) consists of a cone penetrometer and a sub-bottom profiler that can be deployed from a ship independently or from a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). This system provides input data to the Near-Real Time Geotechnical Analysis (NRTGA) system in support of critical Navy survey requirements.  As PGTK continues to be tested and used in the field; continuing technical, engineering, and software support is required to maintain system availability.  A high level of system availability is necessary after every deployment. The level of support depends largely on problems encountered during system use and due to wear and tear as the system ages. 

The NFESC is requesting contractor support to supplement government technical personnel and capabilities.  Additionally, during deployments, improvements and upgrades (that increase system capabilities, reliability, or availability) may be identified.  These improvements and upgrades (planned and unplanned) require varying levels of contractor support.  Finally, drawings, manuals, checklists, and other documentation will need to be updated or rewritten; contractor support is required for documentation support.

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 and the annual size standard is 500 Employees.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-07-00142.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.   A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  Shipping, installation and training charges need to be included in price.  The NAICS code is 334516, and the SBA  size standard is 500 employees.   PROCUREMENT ABSTRACT: The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory, Mid-Continent Ecology Division, Large Lakes and Rivers Forecasting Research Branch at Grosse Ile,  Michigan requires a ICP/MS to conduct trace elemental analyses of environmental samples at the Large Lakes Research Station (LLRS), Grosse Ile, Michigan.  Because regulatory action levels and recognized health-effect levels of toxic metals are continually decreasing, the principal requirement of  the ICP/MS will be extremely low detection limits that are interference free from polyatomic interferences.  Computer, operating system, and software to control the ICP/MS and analyze the data must be provided with the instrument.  The Government's minimum functional requirements for the ICP/MS are  as follows: 1.  The ICP/MS, refrigerated circulator, and computer must fit within a seven foot long by three foot deep footprint with a height of no more than seven feet. 2.  The ICP/MS must be contained within a single housing that has casters that permit instrument to be moved for service. 3.   The ICP-MS must have integrated roughing pumps and peristaltic pump. 4.  The instrument must come with all components needed for successful company?s technician to place instrument into fully operational mode; excluding electric power and exhaust requirements. 5.  The instrument must be delivered  to an interior location within the building it is to be installed.  Trucks larger than 30 feet long can not negotiate turns to the loading dock. 6.  The instrument system must be turn-key installed by vendor in designated room. 7.  The instrument must be fully computer controlled with software  running in a Windows XP operating system environment. 8.  Components included must be a refrigerated chiller for cooling the instrument.  Water chillers are not acceptable. 9.  The instrument must have a lens system that can be easily changed by the purchaser. 10.  The instrument must be a  high-speed, high resolution quadrupole ICP/MS. 11.  The instrument must have computer-controlled auto-optimization of the ion optics. 12.  The instrument must be capable of resolving masses to 0.3 amu. 13.  The instrument must be capable of measuring part per trillion levels while eliminating  polyatomic interferences.  Metals of particular interest include Fe56, As75, Ni60, and Se80 in solutions with 100 ppm or more of Ca in a nitric acid or hydrochloric acid matrix.  Mass interferences from CaCl+, ArCl+, Ar2+, CaO+, and Ar+ must be removed. 14.  When primary interferences are reduced,  new interferences must not be created. 15.  The ICP/MS must run on 208 volts with one or two outlets; each outlet on a separate 30 amp circuit. 16.  The refrigerated chiller must run on 208 volts with a 15 amp circuit. 17.  The instrument must use HF-resistant cross-flow nebulizer sample  introduction. 18.  The instrument must come with a currently manufactured inkjet printer. 19.  The instrument?s torch system must be easily changed by purchaser. 20.  The instrument must have a dynamic range of at least eight orders of magnitude. 21.  Service technicians must be within 200  miles of Grosse Ile, Michigan to have the capability of an 8 hr response time when needed. 22.  Instrument warranty must be a minimum of 12 months from the time of installation. 23.  On-site introductory training for up to 4 staff must be provided at the time the instrument is installed. 24.   Additional more intense training for two staff persons must be provided onsite or at an appropriate vendor site within the continental U.S. within twelve (12) months following the Government?s acceptance of the instrument. 25.  Integrated instrument must be turn-key installed no later than 30  calendar days following the receipt of purchase order. All functional specifications must be documented and supported in the Vendor's response to the Technical Specifications.  If the instrument performance is defined by published specification (e.g. a data sheet), reference to and attachment of  that published material is sufficient to support a claim of "meets specification".  If the instrument performance required to meet specifications is not supported by written documentation, then definitive proof of the ability of the instrument to meet the specification must be provided with the  vendor response to the RFQ.  Responses such as "meet specification" of "full compliance with specification" will be deemed not responsive unless they are supported by documentation of compliance.  Lack of documentation will be evaluated as evidence of non-compliance. There are performance  specifications, which must be met; performance expectations, compliance with which must be documented; hardware and design specifications, compliance with which must be documented; and requirements for full disclosure of capabilities to provide instrument support within the United States. The  vendor is to document the installed base of the instrument and peripheral devices being bid.  Information must be sufficient for the bidder to make contact with any and all users during our evaluation of the performance of the instrument in the field.  The vendor is to document the service force  supporting the instrument, including name, location, and experience with the instrumentation being bid. REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: The complete system as ordered shall be delivered and installed no more than 30 calendar days after award.  The system should be transported in packaging that  eliminates the possibility of damage during shipment and be received in crating units such that movement to required location will not be hindered.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a non-competitive, sole source basis purchase to ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Carlsbad, California 92008.   The system that we require will use an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach.  It will use robotics to extract and isolate DNA from samples, followed by transfer to a PCR thermal cycler to amplify the DNA after introduction of particular, and specifically chosen, primers.  Once the amplification has been completed, the sample will be robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry.  A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms.  The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps.  By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices.  The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.  The main specifications for the system are:
1.	PCR-based amplification of DNA from samples to produce amplicons of 100-120 base pair length, using carefully selected primers that can classify organisms generally or specifically.
2.	Robotic cleanup of PCR amplicons.
3.	Electrospray TOF-MS analysis of amplicons at high mass accuracy (<20 ppm).
4.	High throughput analysis capability of over 1500 PCR products per day.
5.	Analysis of the masses of complementary DNA strands to identify unique composition (based on DNA strand complements) of bases in strand.
6.	Comparison of base composition to library of known base compositions (for given primers) for known organisms

The unique specifications of this system include:
1.	PCR Assay and clean-up kit:  This kit contains ten 96-well plates with pre-selected PCR primers that amplify carefully selected regions of DNA to produce products in the size range compatible with the mass range and resolving power of the mass spectrometer.  These PCR primers are selected based on the target study and can provide general or specific information about the nature of the organisms in question.   The primers are specifically designed by IBIS.  Internal standards are also included in the kits.
2.	Automated desalting and cleanup module:  This component consists of a robotic heat sealer which seals the 96-well plates so that they cannot be contaminated, followed by robotic desalting and clean-up of the PCR amplicons.  Desalting is done on magnetic beads.  This system is designed to minimize the possibility of sample contamination.
3.	Sample injection fluidics module:  A custom fluidics module is designed to sample each purified mixture with minimal cross contamination and introduce it into a liquid stream at a carefully controlled flow rate for subsequent ESI-MS analysis.  The system alternates between high flow rates (for cleaning between samples) and lower flow rates (200 microliters per minute) for the analytical steps.  The module precisely controls injection volumes as well.  The injection system controls the voltages on the electrospray source so that the system is not electrospraying while higher cleaning flow rates are being used between samples.
4.	Mass spectrometer system for DNA detection:  This component consists of a Bruker MicrOTOF electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF) for analysis of PCR products introduced by the sample injection fluidics module.  This instrument consists of an orthogonal injection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an off-axis sprayer.  The orthogonal injection source allows for ion accumulation prior to MS analysis to improve sensitivity.  The TOF contains a reflectron to insure high mass resolution.  The mass spectrometer is controlled by Bruker MicrOTOF software.  The instrument has the following specifications:
a.	Standard mass range 50 ? 3,000 m/z
b.	Extended mass range 50 ? 20,000 m/z
c.	Mass resolution >10,000 FWHM in standard configuration and >15,000 FWHM with MicrOTOF focus
d.	Mass accuracy of 3 ppm (RMS) error with internal calibration
e.	Mass accuracy of 5 ppm (RMS) error with external calibration
f.	Acquisition rate of 20 Hz (full mass range profile mass spectra to hard disk)
g.	Polarity switching for both, positive and negative ions
h.	ESI orthogonal electrospray source (1?l ?1 ml/min)
i.	MicrOTOF instrument control software
5.	IBIS Control and Analysis Software
a.	Robotics Software:  controls and coordinates the sample handling and sample injection processes by controlling the robotic components of the system.  This includes the cleanup and injection portion of the analysis.
b.	Control software:  This component manages the liquid flow system and the mass spectrometer (by interfacing with the mass spectrometer software), as well as integrates the total operation of the system
c.	Sample tracking software
d.	Relational database:  Curated database of genomics information that contains base counts (composition) for primer pairs for microorganisms.  This database contains sequences generated by known primers for a large number of microorganisms.  The information is maintained for primers that are designed to differentiate at the family level (e.g. enterobacter) and at the species and strain level.  This database is a unique and indispensable part of the system, since base compositions stored in this database will be compared with those generated experimentally.  This component is critical for rapid detection and proper identification of bacteria.  
e.	Data Processor:  Analyzes mass spectrometry data from both forward and reverse strands of amplified DNA to generate the unique base composition for the sequence in question.  It function is to then compare the generated base composition to a database of known base compositions that would be generated from sequences produced for a given set of primers. FDA intends to make an award fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Government.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Quantum Electrical Metrology Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Soitec USA, Inc, of Peabody, Massachusetts, for the purchase of UNIBOND SOI Wafers used in fabrication of Si-based single-electron tunneling (SET) devices, as part of the SET project.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers are required based on NIST?s need to make high-quality Si-based SET devices.  In particular, one crucial requirement of these devices is that they have no charge offset drift; the source of this drift in other devices is defects in the device material.  Therefore, NIST requires the starting material to have an acceptably low level of dislocations.  The UNIBOND process is the only one that satisfies this need for low defect density.  As a result, Soitec USA, is uniquely qualified to provide the required UNIBOND SOI Wafers.  Soitec USA is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these wafers

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Eppendorf Realplex real time PCR Instrument

Purpose/Brief History:

Molecular Imaging plays a major role in cancer detection and treatment. Recognizing this, the CCR actively invests in clinical and basic imaging research. The CCR supports investigation in advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT), and optical techniques. The CCR has initiated a Molecular Imaging Program that includes the development and testing of tissue-specific MRI, PET, radionuclide, and optical imaging probes for the detection of cancer. The Molecular Imaging Program designs, develops and tests novel targeted imaging probes for the detection and characterization of cancer. The identification of tissue specific gene expression and protein abundance are essential techniques.  

Recent advances into the molecular pathogenesis of cancer provide unprecedented opportunities for discovery and development of novel, molecularly targeted imaging agents.   The challenge to discovery and development remains the definitive validation of human cancer-pertinent molecular targets. The Molecular Imaging Program is actively identifying novel molecular targets important in cancer imaging using public available resources. After target identification the validation is a major step towards designing clinically relevant imaging bioprobes. One project in the Molecular Imaging Program screens for differential expressed genes in cancer versus normal tissues. The real time PCR instrument enables rapid validation of potential target and facilitates the development of novel targeted imaging agents for cancer.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such actions is in the public interest, and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  Discussions, if held, may take the form of written questions, as well as oral presentations.

<DESC>As part of a U.S. Government inter-agency process, the U.S. Department of Commerce has been providing technical assistance to create in Iraq a legal and tax environment conducive to domestic and foreign investment in the country?s key economic sectors, starting with the mineral resources sector.  The Commercial Law Development Program (CLDP), an entity of the U.S. Department of Commerce specializing in technical assistance, manages the program and shares expertise with other USG agencies.
As part of the program, CLDP has formed, and coordinates, an International Legal Standards Advisory Group (ILSAG), whose members are professors of energy law.
ILSAG has provided input, when requested, to the U.S. Department of Commerce, to other USG agencies, and has made expertise available to the Iraqi authorities as the latter were drafting the laws and regulations that will govern Iraq's oil and gas sector, in order to ensure that these laws and regulations comport with international legal standards.  As these laws start being implemented, the scope of CLDP?s mandate has expanded to include technical workshops, seminars and conferences geared towards the identification of legal issues critical to the oil and gas sectors, and towards the discussion of alternative solutions to these issues.  CLDP wishes, therefore, to include a practitioner among the members of ILSAG.

CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES:  Through the present contract, the Contractor will assist CLDP in providing expertise to the U.S. Department of Commerce, to other USG agencies, or to Iraqi authorities on creating a legal and tax environment conducive to domestic and foreign investment in Iraq?s oil and gas sector.  The Contractor will serve as one of the experts on ILSAG.  

In particular, the Contractor may be called upon by CLDP to do the following:
1.	To provide expert input, when requested, to the U.S. Department of Commerce, to other USG agencies, or to Iraqi authorities as they draft the laws and regulations that will govern Iraq's oil and gas sector; 

2.	To help with the implementation of the four hydrocarbon laws, through seminars, workshops or conferences.

3.	To review for consistency with international standards, the draft by-laws and standard contracts of the Iraqi agencies that will be created to grant exploration and exploitation licenses, to enter into joint venture agreements with foreign firms (upstream and downstream agreements), and to regulate Iraq?s hydrocarbon sector.  The Contractor will share her/his conclusions with the U.S. Department of Commerce, with other USG agencies, or with Iraqi authorities, at CLDP?s behest.

4.	To closely coordinate all of the above with the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Iraq.

4.  CONTRACTOR ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES:  In addition to other duties included in this contract, the Contractor shall:

a) Strictly abide by security instructions given by the State Department, and/or by its personnel on the ground, in particular by Regional Security Officers.

b) Advise CLDP, at the earliest possible time, if the Contractor is not able to perform the contract for any reason;

c) Report to the CLDP office, at the earliest convenience, any issues that may impair Contractor?s work and the performance of the contract;

d) Not provide information on the Contractor?s work to anyone, unless authorized in advance and in writing by CLDP.

FORCE MAJEURE

In case of events beyond the control of the parties, CLDP and the Contractor will agree upon a new schedule and period of performance.


The duration of this contract is from date of award through May 30, 2008 with three one year option periods.  The Government contemplates award of a Requirements Contract, FAR 52.216-21, resulting from this RFQ.  Vendor must be actively registered in the Central Contractors Registration, CCR, in accordance with 52.204-7.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Investigations (OI), proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition from Motorola, Inc., 7031 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia, MD 21046.

To address mission-critical law enforcement requirements of OI, a new digital Key Management Facility (KMF) system is required. ICE components rely heavily on tactical wireless communications in order to accomplish their missions and ensure officers? safety. A significant portion of the legacy equipment and systems that comprise ICE?s tactical wireless communications systems are analog, wideband equipment that does not meet current standards for interoperability, encryption utilization ), and narrowband communications (More efficient frequency spectrum utilization). This proposed procurement will address many of these limitations by procuring a digitally, encrypted, narrowband, interoperable wireless communications key management system to meet high-priority, risk-based requirements of OI and satisfy Congressional direction to transition from analog to digital communications.   Only Motorola?s Corp. system has been accepted through testing and is currently deployed in the field utilizing these previously delineated requirements. This system includes installation and data uploading.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire services for amass data, conduct analysis, design and monitor restoration projects in the John Day Basin. The period of performance is from date of award through September 30, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The known source is the Eco Logical Research, Inc. 1.2	Background and Objective.  The Center provides scientific and technical support to NOAA Fisheries for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest region?s marine and anadromous resources. 
 The John Day River Basin Restoration and Monitoring Group is a multi-agency group created by NOAA Fisheries in 2000 to help fund and monitor restoration efforts in the John Day River basin, a major tributary to the Columbia River. The Monitoring Group works with state, tribal and local government scientists to amass data, conduct analyses, and design and monitor restoration projects in the John Day basin.  Much of the development and support of technical analyses used by the Monitoring Group is conducted by staff at the NWFSC.
	The Monitoring Group has determined that a critical need for the John Day River basin is stream specific estimates of adult steelhead spawning escapement and juvenile abundance.  Using a probabilistic sampling design to estimate adult steelhead escapement in basins such as Murderers Creek will allow for determination of habitat productivity.  That is, work determining adult abundance can be coupled with work determining juvenile abundance, thus allowing for determination of juveniles per adult, which is a true measure of salmonid productivity from that stream. 
Eco Logical Research is the regional expert in coordinating restoration and monitoring efforts in the John Day River basin as part of the John Day River Basin Restoration and Monitoring Group, a multi-agency group created by NOAA Fisheries in 2000. This work  allows continued monitoring long-term trends in salmonid abundance in the John Day River basin and to assess any changes in salmonid abundance that result from restoration efforts. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the Eco Logical Research, Inc. without further notice.

<SUBJECT>B -- Coordinating ecological studies of North Pacific killer whales
<SOLNBR>WASC-7-6864
<RESPDATE>071207
<ARCHDATE>07272007
<CONTACT>Melvin Fondue, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206) 526-6043, Fax (206) 526-6025, Email melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov
<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire support service for coordinating studies of North Pacific Killer Whales. The period of performance is from date of award through June 15, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The known source is the Center for Whale Research. Background and problem statement:
Basic questions about the population biology of North Pacific killer whales remain unanswered, despite an increase in data collection over the past decade. In recent years, the extent of field studies has increased, and numerous government, university, and independent researchers are collecting killer whale data in coastal waters from California through Alaska, and also in parts of Russia. Within this area, two populations of killer whales have been designated as depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and one population has been listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Additionally, predation by killer whales has been implicated in the declines in abundance of several protected marine mammal species, they compete with long-line and trawl fisheries, and by-catch levels of killer whales in commercial fisheries cannot be properly evaluated because of uncertainties in population structure and abundance. Therefore, there is a strong need for collaborative and coordinated studies to take advantage of this growing and extensive amount of data to perform required stock assessments, particularly to fill key data gaps on abundance, population structure, distribution and movements, and foraging ecology.

In FY05 the US Congress appropriated funds to the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission to review the role of killer whales in marine ecosystems. In response, the Commission produced a research plan designed to fill key data gaps, and facilitated the establishment of the Killer Whale Ecological Studies Team (KWEST) to implement this research plan. KWEST will be responsible for facilitating collaborative analyses of existing data, pursuing sources of funding and implementing new studies, and integrating the results of new studies into coordinated analyses. This collaboration will lead to studies of killer whales in the North Pacific on an unprecedented scale.  To implement the research plan, there has to be both a willingness of the researchers to participate and also a means different datasets to be integrated. This contract will address both these issues. For the past three decades, CWR has conducted an ongoing monitoring project of killer whales in the NE Pacific. CWR therefore has an unprecedented history of killer whale research, and a long history of collaborative studies, working closely with independent and academic research groups, as well as government research agencies both in the U.S. and Canada. In recent years, CWR has been involved in active collaborations with NOAA/NWFSC and NOAA/AFSC to facilitate stock assessments and listing decisions under the MMPA and ESA. 
 The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to the Center for Whale Research without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval on a brand name ony basis is for the use of the Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 4100 fingerprint scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State (DOS) infrastructure connectivity requirements and USG Agency interoperability, thereby precluding consideration fo the products of other companies. The office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST) of the Department s bureau of Consular Affairs requires the purchase of the scanners referenced for the Bureau’s worldwide 10 print fingerprint capture initiative, which will begin in July 2007 and must be completed by the end of calendar year 2007.  The Homeland Security Council decided on June 7, 2005 that the USG standard for biometric screening of foreign nationals coming into the US should transition from two fingerprints to ten fingerprints to enable the two major USG fingerprint systems, the DHS IDENT system and the FBI IAFIS system, to establish interoperability.The transition to ten prints also will enable the Bureau of Consular Affairs to clear visa applicants’ fingerprints against the FBI IAFIS system, which in turn will allow consularoficers to more effectively screen out applicants who are ineligible due to criminal history records.  Consular officers eventually will be relieved of the task of reviewing long lists of non-exact NCIII name results to determine if an applicant may have a criminal history record.  DHS/CBP also is moving to ten-print collection at the ports of entry, expecting to deploy by 2008.<BR><BR>The 10 print capture initiatives will ensure that the DOS fully complies with section 303 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform act of 2002. CA Requires that any scanner selected for the pilot must meet the following software compatibility requirements: 1) The scanner must be able to function as a replacement for the Smiths Heimann LS/2 Check fingerprint scanner and as an alternative to the Cross Match Guardian fingerprint scanner. 2) The scanner must meet FBI EFTS certification requirements 3) The scanner must have an API (application programming interface) available for integration into custom applications such as TPLS (Ten Print Live Scan) In Summation, CA/CST maintains that it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire Identix TouchPrint Enhanced Definition 1400 fingerprint scanners without delay so that the Department’s worldwide implementation and use of the 10 print fingerprint capture system modules may commence as scheduled in July 2007 and be completed by the end of calendar 2007. The 41 USC 253 ( C ) ( 1 ) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items to meet the Department’s requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), Library Services and Content Management (LSCM), Library Technical Information Services (LTIS) seeks to acquire bibliographic metadata transcription services for ca. 600,000 3 x 5 catalog cards in its 1,000,000 card historic shelflist collection.   These cards contain brief bibliographic metadata captured as part of the cataloging activity for the Cataloging and Indexing (C&I) Program and the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) from ca. 1870s until the shelflist officially closed in October 1992.  GPO?s goal is to convert the bibliographic data on these cards into machine-readable records in MARC21 format so that they can be loaded to GPO?s Integrated Library System (ILS) (Aleph 500) catalog.  

LSCM manages the National Bibliography of U.S. Government Publications formerly known as the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP). The unit catalogs in all formats published by all three branches of the U.S. Government in accordance with 44, U.S.C., Section 1710-1711.  Documents in the National Bibliography are available through the online CGP (http://catalog.gpo.gov).

2.	   Approach

The successful offeror will be directed by GPO to perform the work in a phased approach, as laid out in this RFP, although later phases may not be required, depending on the priorities set by the GPO.   Each phase will be completed over four option years after the initial phase is completed in the first year.  Offerors will provide a plan for one year?s worth of work on the bibliographic metadata transcription process not to exceed $100,000. Offerors should also provide a proposal for the four option years.  

The successful offeror will be required to transcribe a test batch of approximately 200 cards into MARC 21 records for evaluation before work begins on the project in full.  The evaluation of the test batch will help determine the best and most efficient workflow approach, and allow GPO to validate the metadata transcription requirements outlined in this RFP. 

Interested vendors should contact the contracting officer, Mrs. Albertha Broadnax on 202-512-0966, 202-512-1354 (fax) or at abroadnax@gpo.gov.

<CONTACT>Kevin Dillon, (609) 485-6911
<DESC>The FAA intends to award an extension to contract DTFACT-04-C-00003 with Galaxy Scientific/SRA.  The FAA has issued the above contract in support of the Transportation Security Labs (TSL) to support services needed to conduct independent verification and validation (IV&V) to qualify Advanced Technology (AT) detection systems for baggage inspection systems supporting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). TSA has an urgent need to conduct additional qualification tests of the AT systems.  A break in service will cause delays in security equipment deployments.  The proposed action must be awarded by mid-July and is expected to require not more than 3,500 labor hours spanning less than 120 days. For another source to provide equivalent, effective and efficient support, it would require a minimum of 4 to 6 months before the level of expertise could be obtained by another company.   The cost of using another source would require more than 7,000 hours delivering the same level of quality services, if the test staff were immediately available and coordinated.  Schedule risk would be rated high and the impact of an incomplete or delayed test report to support a TSA procurement decision would significantly delay deployment of security equipment at airports. TSL intends to issue a solicitation of at least $2M using pre-qualified sources identified in the DHS/EAGLE program. Please Note that my the above email address is incorrect.  It is a system error and should read kevin.dillon@faa.gov.

<DESC>Questions and Answers FA2823-07-R-0026:
1. Position Accuracy and Repeatability vary greatly depending on the method used to measure the angle. Is it acceptable to take the measurements off the back of the readout package rather than off the actual gimbal even though it is not an accurate indication of the actual angle of the system? 
Answer: No.  Due to possible inaccuracies of the feedback/readout packages the gimbal angle itself must be measured independent of the feedback/readout package.  Possible measurement may be obtained by using an optical polygon and a theodolite containing the required accuracy measuring capability.

2. These specifications look like position transducer specifications and not the actual accuracy of the system? If this is the transducer specification, what is the specification for the system? If it is the system specification, should we quote lesser accuracy variations also as meeting these accuracy will require extensive mechanical modifications if it is achievable at all?

Answer: The question seems to be unclear.  However, solicitation presented ?system? specifications.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 TO PREVIOUS NOTICE:

This amendment is to correct the email address for Hugh Thomson. The correct email address is hugh.thomson@navy.mil

ORIGINAL NOTICE: This is a source of sought announcement for written information only.  This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  In preparation for a future procurement, The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme, CA is performing a ?market research? to determine potential firms that can demonstrate technology, equipment and software related to inspection of seafloor cables using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV?s). Underwater inspections provide valuable information in assessing cable condition and planning for cable maintenance or repair operations.  The ultimate program objective is to provide the Navy with a capability to use AUV?s to inspect underwater range cables which are laid ?proud? (exposed) on the seafloor. Seafloor types include sediment, gravel and rocky.   Locations for these cables are generally known within a radius of a few hundred yards and their heading is generally known within 20 degrees. Cables of interest may be 5 to 40 km (3 to 25 miles) long in water depths from 25 to 5,000 meter (80 to 16,500 ft).  Range cables are ?small cables? defined as approximately 1.6 to 3.2 cm (5/8 to 1 ? inch) diameter with internal steel strength member?s equivalent to a 0.6 cm (?-inch) diameter steel cable. The cables are typically covered with either a black or white colored polyethylene jacket or occasionally in shallow water with a black ?jute? wrapping.  AUV?s are potentially attractive platforms for cable following and inspection operations.  AUV?s can significantly reduce cable inspection costs by reducing the high costs associated with leasing and operating an ROV or manned submersible and support vessel.  The critical technology that is currently considered ?missing? for conducting an AUV cable inspection is the sensors, and the associated cable acquisition/following algorithms used to detect, identify and follow the ?small? cable.  Integration and operation of the equipment on an AUV is not a part of this phase of the demonstration, nor is it the intent of this effort to develop new sensors or AUV?s. Currently available AUV?s have suites of guidance and navigation software/hardware and are capable of hosting detection systems and fusing together guidance data from various sensors.  NFESC is interested in funding a demonstration(s) to establish the feasibility of using AUV?s (autonomously and using passive - non tone applied techniques) to locate, and follow small seafloor range cables laying ?proud? on the surface of the seafloor.  The intent of this effort is to demonstrate the feasibility of equipment (sensors) and methods (software) to autonomously detect and follow the cable. It is not the intent of this effort to demonstrate the performance of an AUV platform.  Thus, the demonstration might be accomplished by conducting a field test using a laboratory platform, ROV or AUV, or by other convenient laboratory demonstration or data simulation.  Demonstrations should as a minimum include all necessary software and hardware to autonomously accomplish the following:  Find and acquire a small diameter cable laying ?proud? on the seafloor given the general location (within a few hundred meters) and heading (within 20 degrees) of the cable; and specific cable properties (cable specifications) cited above.  Follow the cable, including determining the direction to follow the cable.   Resolve issues along route:  Reacquire the cable after losing the cable in short runs of sediment cover - Resolve issues related to crossing cables.  Notes:  (1) Techniques that allow for following a buried cable are not a part of this effort but are of potential future interest (2) Following must be accomplished in a manner that will allow the AUV to photo or video document the entire length of the cable.  Organizations that have all or some of these capabilities are invited to submit information on their related experience, technology available and proposed approach to demonstrate meeting the requirements.  A summary, citing related work demonstrating relevant experience should be included.  Responses to this announcement can include both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches.  Responses should include a technical description with characteristics of the proposed technology including for example:  the recommended demonstration approach; detection algorithms; sensors and expected detection resolution.   There should be sufficient detail to allow the government to determine the development state and suitability of the technology to meet the requirements and the value of a funded demonstration.  Organizations responding to this Sources Sought announcement should not include proprietary information in their responses.  Any responses that include information marked as proprietary will be returned unread.  Responses to this announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives.  This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The government will assess the technology described in the submittals for potential application to AUV underwater cable following and inspection. Firms with technology assessed to provide significant value and potential for AUV underwater cable following and inspection may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their technology.  Discuss the requirement and your firms, ability to provide the requested procurement.  The applicable NAICS code is 541330 with a size limitation standard of $20M.   Interested sources must submit any comments and information by via email to Hugh.Thomas@navy.mil and Richard.Camacho@navy.mil no later than 26 July 2007.  Responses received after this deadline may not be considered.  Since this is a sources of sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of information and sensor data analysis technology and associated sensors that will overcome deficiencies and enhance capabilities in existing and planned systems that support law enforcement and corrections efforts and the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center Northeast (NLECTC-NE.) The NLECTC-NE's mission is to work with government, industry, and academia to identify, evaluate, develop, demonstrate, and assess technology applications for law enforcement and corrections agencies. These efforts include, but are not limited to, concealed weapons detection, audio processing, video surveillance, facial recognition, timeline analysis, communications, communications and information systems interoperability, command and control, mobile and wireless computing, computer forensics, cyber crime, digital evidence handling, school safety, Integrated Border Enforcement Team (IBET), information management, and information storage, retrieval and exploitation. High level overviews of areas of interest for this BAA are in the following paragraphs.    Concealed Weapons Detection (CWD) using either active or passive sensors is a priority for military personnel performing peacekeeping missions, law enforcement officers, and security personnel. Of interest are low cost technologies that can provide portable concealed weapons detection to include weapons with little or no metal content and explosives. Technology which could perform this at a standoff distances of at least ten meters and/or operate autonomously for weapons screening is also of interest. Also of interest are technologies to perform Through the Wall Surveillance (TWS) and Personnel Location and Tracking (PL&T).  This includes the ability to detect, track and identify moving and stationary targets through building materials and rubble in the case of Urban Search and Rescue (US&R).    Technology development may include those generate a floor plan from outside of a structure as well.    The development of audio processing technologies to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. Video surveillance technologies and tools to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, e.g., facial recognition, identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.    Timeline analysis technologies to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. Timeline analysis tools to allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.    Communications research, development and demonstration of voice and data communications for public safety applications. Communications support voice, data, and "broadband" data (such as real-time video, geographic/map data and overlays, etc.), and can be transmitted via landline, radio frequencies, and/or microwave frequencies, both clear and encrypted. Mobile and wireless computing to provide a local data processing capability giving those in the field users a more responsive and interactive data accessing environment.    Geographic information tools and technologies are increasingly important for law enforcement in coordinating the response of resource and in the analysis of data and discovery of trends/patterns. Geospatial systems integrated into communications networks would assist command and control capabilities by directing messages to those elements which where able to effectively respond. For example, it could increase efficiency by providing information to those who need it, while filtering irrelevant information.    Interoperability is a key element of law enforcement/public safety operations. It is the ability to share/disseminate information to those who need it without impediments created by differing systems, offices, or organizations. Research and analysis of interoperability issues are critical to address early on to provide roadmaps for development and implementation which reduces the conflicts experienced when interfacing with dissimilar systems.    Enhancement of communications systems is an area of interest in this BAA. Communications systems can include private land mobile radio (LMR) systems, commercial services, and/or specialized systems such as wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and satellite communications. Advanced technologies including, but not limited to, software defined radios, voice over IP (VoIP), wireless LAN, 3G wireless data, ultra wideband communications, and mesh networks have the potential to significantly enhance law enforcement and public safety communications; part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring these technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market.    Computer Forensics, Cyber-crime: Perform applied research and prototype development in the digital forensic sciences for mission time-critical needs of military and civilian operational networks with spin-offs for the statute-driven law enforcement approach. Explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence to 1) describe cyber-attack activities, enabling post-attack critical information data and infrastructure restoration, 2) correlate, interpret, and predict adversarial actions and their impact on military operations, and 3) ensure digital data scenario evidence has provable integrity appropriate for military defensive and offensive operations and, possibly, criminal investigations.    Information storage, management, retrieval, and exploitation are technologies that law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice, and public safety agencies increasingly rely upon. The information must be maintained securely while still allowing timely access and updating by multiple agencies/organizations. These systems also need to go types beyond the traditional text based systems to encompass additional and new data types, e.g. audio, video, geospatial. These systems must be able to integrate into the modern computing/networked environment.    Assessments of state-of-the-art of the technologies above will be performed and provided for law enforcement and corrections agencies. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.    Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.    In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information. Contact the technical POC. The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Motion imagery and conventional imagery both provide visual data sources for intelligence gathering purposes through the use of various exploitation technologies and methodologies that demand high performance and dynamic operations to meet mission tasking and exploitation timelines.  Data formats, sensor type and spectral characteristics are the determining factors that dictate the exploitation technologies that will be required to process the data and extract the information to obtain the mission objectives.  The streaming video data format require different strategies for processing motion imagery over conventional two dimensional imaging sensors, but these sensors also differ with some being active or passive and spectral range of operation that require other processing and exploitation considerations.  Although motion imagery and conventional imagery have differing requirements with respect to the implementation of the processing strategies, the types of processing strategies can be very similar.  These imagery collection systems and the resultant data are exploited by teams of analysts, operational and warfighter personnel.  Exploitation often includes object or target detection, material identification and producing a report.  The goal of this research and development activity is to produce better tools and procedures to support exploitation operations in deriving more accurate and timely information from motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  Specific areas include: 

Ability to ingest, visualize, process, exploit and output imagery products in standard and planned data formats for motion imagery and conventional imagery sources.  These formats shall include evolving new data structure and compression schema standards.

Improved procedures for performing graphics annotation to create embedded non-destructive graphic, symbology and textual layers to accompany motion imagery or conventional image data files in standardized formats.

Object tracking paradigms that provide technologies for continuous real time object tracking of both stationary and moving targets of opportunity.  These technologies shall address the conditions where the target is temporarily obscured by intervening objects or shadows and then reappears.  Tracking shall be accomplished through graphic, text and symbolic overlays and shall also calculate speed and direction parameters for the target.

Enhanced algorithms to perform feature extraction and image segmentation.  These algorithms are required to provide enclosed line segment boundaries outlining targets and objects of interest in order to compute statistics for characterizing the feature's shape, size, material content and other identifying information for pattern recognition purposes and to support object tracking paradigms.

Optimized techniques for analysts to produce coherent change detection and two color multi-view products from synthetic aperture radar sources.

Refined spectral analysis capabilities to perform anomaly detection, surface material identification, atmospheric correction and the use of common signature libraries for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.

Two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualization capabilities to support the presentation of multiple intelligence data sources, including motion imagery (e.g., visible, IR, etc.), imagery, maps, elevation data, text, graphics and symbology, in a common geospatial reference for exploitation purposes.

Effective methodologies for deriving accurate geo-positioning information and performing precise mensuration in which operations span the use of diverse data sets and evolving concepts such as smart images.

Software design and development strategies that follow accepted standards and provide intuitive motion imagery and conventional imagery exploitation tools for the analyst and implement and support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) oriented scenario concepts such as publish and subscribe mechanisms.

CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and technical merit, including the rationale and approach for the proposed technology development, (2) Potential contribution and relevance to this effort including advanced technology prototyping, demonstration, and integration, (3) Related experience and capabilities and extent to which the offeror demonstrates Motion Imagery and Conventional Imagery related technology and domain knowledge, conformity to accepted DOD and Commercial Standards and Specifications and soundness of proposed technology transition approach, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Top Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Top Secret information at the time of award.

<DESC>The non-competitive award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a Purchase Order on a non-competitive, sole source basis purchase to ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Carlsbad, California 92008.   The system that we require will use an integrated sample preparation and measurement approach.  It will use robotics to extract and isolate DNA from samples, followed by transfer to a PCR thermal cycler to amplify the DNA after introduction of particular, and specifically chosen, primers.  Once the amplification has been completed, the sample will be robotically handled and cleaned up, followed by analysis using electrospray mass spectrometry.  A mass spectrometry measurement of the PCR amplicons gives a detailed organism fingerprint, which provides much more information than a simple yes/no answer provided by probes in real-time PCR; detection is not limited to previously known organisms.  The approach can rapidly identify organisms in a mixture without additional sample preparation steps.  By adjusting the primer selection, the method can be made general or specific and can rapidly identify mutations (within the amplified region). The approach can handle many different types of samples including: air, soil, water, mucosal swabs and washes, sterile fluids (blood, CSF, urine), hair, teeth, and bone, making it very amenable to food matrices.  The approach is also high throughput, allowing for the analysis of 600-1200 samples per 24 hour period.  The main specifications for the system are:
1.	PCR-based amplification of DNA from samples to produce amplicons of 100-120 base pair length, using carefully selected primers that can classify organisms generally or specifically.
2.	Robotic cleanup of PCR amplicons.
3.	Electrospray TOF-MS analysis of amplicons at high mass accuracy (<20 ppm).
4.	High throughput analysis capability of over 1500 PCR products per day.
5.	Analysis of the masses of complementary DNA strands to identify unique composition (based on DNA strand complements) of bases in strand.
6.	Comparison of base composition to library of known base compositions (for given primers) for known organisms

The unique specifications of this system include:
1.	PCR Assay and clean-up kit:  This kit contains ten 96-well plates with pre-selected PCR primers that amplify carefully selected regions of DNA to produce products in the size range compatible with the mass range and resolving power of the mass spectrometer.  These PCR primers are selected based on the target study and can provide general or specific information about the nature of the organisms in question.   The primers are specifically designed by IBIS.  Internal standards are also included in the kits.
2.	Automated desalting and cleanup module:  This component consists of a robotic heat sealer which seals the 96-well plates so that they cannot be contaminated, followed by robotic desalting and clean-up of the PCR amplicons.  Desalting is done on magnetic beads.  This system is designed to minimize the possibility of sample contamination.
3.	Sample injection fluidics module:  A custom fluidics module is designed to sample each purified mixture with minimal cross contamination and introduce it into a liquid stream at a carefully controlled flow rate for subsequent ESI-MS analysis.  The system alternates between high flow rates (for cleaning between samples) and lower flow rates (200 microliters per minute) for the analytical steps.  The module precisely controls injection volumes as well.  The injection system controls the voltages on the electrospray source so that the system is not electrospraying while higher cleaning flow rates are being used between samples.
4.	Mass spectrometer system for DNA detection:  This component consists of a Bruker MicrOTOF electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF) for analysis of PCR products introduced by the sample injection fluidics module.  This instrument consists of an orthogonal injection time-of-flight mass spectrometer with an off-axis sprayer.  The orthogonal injection source allows for ion accumulation prior to MS analysis to improve sensitivity.  The TOF contains a reflectron to insure high mass resolution.  The mass spectrometer is controlled by Bruker MicrOTOF software.  The instrument has the following specifications:
a.	Standard mass range 50 ? 3,000 m/z
b.	Extended mass range 50 ? 20,000 m/z
c.	Mass resolution >10,000 FWHM in standard configuration and >15,000 FWHM with MicrOTOF focus
d.	Mass accuracy of 3 ppm (RMS) error with internal calibration
e.	Mass accuracy of 5 ppm (RMS) error with external calibration
f.	Acquisition rate of 20 Hz (full mass range profile mass spectra to hard disk)
g.	Polarity switching for both, positive and negative ions
h.	ESI orthogonal electrospray source (1?l ?1 ml/min)
i.	MicrOTOF instrument control software
5.	IBIS Control and Analysis Software
a.	Robotics Software:  controls and coordinates the sample handling and sample injection processes by controlling the robotic components of the system.  This includes the cleanup and injection portion of the analysis.
b.	Control software:  This component manages the liquid flow system and the mass spectrometer (by interfacing with the mass spectrometer software), as well as integrates the total operation of the system
c.	Sample tracking software
d.	Relational database:  Curated database of genomics information that contains base counts (composition) for primer pairs for microorganisms.  This database contains sequences generated by known primers for a large number of microorganisms.  The information is maintained for primers that are designed to differentiate at the family level (e.g. enterobacter) and at the species and strain level.  This database is a unique and indispensable part of the system, since base compositions stored in this database will be compared with those generated experimentally.  This component is critical for rapid detection and proper identification of bacteria.  
e.	Data Processor:  Analyzes mass spectrometry data from both forward and reverse strands of amplified DNA to generate the unique base composition for the sequence in question.  It function is to then compare the generated base composition to a database of known base compositions that would be generated from sequences produced for a given set of primers. FDA intends to make an award fifteen (15) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the Government.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  An award will be made immediately after the response date of this notice.  The award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>Modification 0001 for Synopsis WC133W-07-RQ-0237
Two New 10-Ton Computer Room Air Conditioning Units for Philadelphia WFO, Mt. Holly, New Jersey.
 

The Brand Name Justification is as follows:

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisitions Regulation 6.302-1 (c), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

The National Weather Service (NWS) is mandated by Executive Order (EO 13423) to maintain, monitor, log and control temperature and humidity in our facilities.   Also, as a Government agency, the NWS is under increased scrutiny and initiative to lower electrical costs of operations.   The American Power Conversion (APC), Precision/Packaged Air Conditioning (PAC) Units offers several features which increase reliability, efficiency, lower maintenance, and manageability.  

A Pre-solicitation research conducted by the contract specialist confirms the validity of the customers request for the American Power Conversion (APC), Precision/Packaged Air Conditioning (PAC) Units branded requirement.  In addition, the Contracting Officer concurs with the customers argument that a product other than the one specified would be costly, less efficient and harder to maintain.

The next phase of the program includes delivery of a sustainable interview instrument that will be used by the Air Force for selected accession screening.  Contractors must demonstrate they have extensive experience and exceptional past performance in the area of human psychology testing and interview screening that is defensible even in court if a candidate challenges the screening process.  The critical competency required for this effort is the demonstrable capability the contractor has previously developed to understand and accurately measure the character and leadership traits inherent in very successful leaders.

<DESC>JT3, at Edwards AFB, is seeking a vendor to enhance its existing Global Positioning System (GPS)-Aided Inertial Navigation Reference (GAINR) Lite (GLite) System. The GLite System is designed to capture and record real time navigation data while in flight. 

The GLite system, developed by the Time Space Position Information (TSPI) department of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Range Division, provides a modular platform for the use of a variety of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors.  The GLite Configuration 2-B (C2B) integrates the Novatel OEM-V GPS receiver, the Honeywell Ring-Laser-Gyro HG1700AG58 IMU, and various other Commercial Off-The-Shelf products to record GPS/IMU data, produce a GPS/IMU blended solution in real-time, and interface with various monitors and controls devices.  The unit records measurements, the trajectory solution, and status information to removable media, or sends this information to a serial port for recording by an external device.

There is now a need for a fully flight certified unit with the capabilities of the GLite C2B.  The goal of this effort is to produce a certified unit that meets military flight specifications and provides all of the GLite C2B capabilities along with some modest enhancements.

If you are interested in receiving the Request for Proposal, please send an email to Tillie.Rivera.ctr@edwards.af.mil.  Request for Proposals will be sent out no sooner than 19 July 2007.  No request for proposals will be considered after 13 July 2007.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Hazard Deficiency
<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) is required by law and committed to providing a safe and healthful environment for its employees.  In order to accomplish this, Air Force Safety Offices worldwide conducts inspections, investigates mishaps, performs Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and acts upon employee complaints in order to identify hazards on an Air Force installation.  When hazards are identified they must be tracked until the hazardous condition is abated.  Currently, the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC) does not have automated capability to track identified hazards, in a single common database nor maintain oversight of the Air Force Hazard Abatement Program.  The objective of the Hazard Deficiency Reporting Software is to provide safety offices the capability to enter and track hazards from identification to abatement in order to protect Air Force (AF) employees and preserve vital national resources in a common automated environment.  This module will also eliminate the need for annual reporting to higher headquarters, provide for analysis of common hazards AF-wide, and the capability to share common data information with other military branches.

-  Holder, Alkaline battery for 900 series, Stock No. 80-6108-6472-2, QTY 2 EA


A contract for a 900 AST, Advance Systems Electrical Tester, will be awarded to 3M Company following no response back to this notice of intent.  The purchase of an Advance System Electrical Tester must be done through 3M Company because they are the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The 900 AST is a handheld, integrated test set designed specifically for locating faults in the wiring of aircraft and its components.  With the tester, electricians can quickly locate faults and verify repairs on wiring utilizing the Resistive Fault Location (RFL) and Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) functions.  This piece of equipment takes the place of five test sets that would normally have to be hooked up separately during a troubleshooting situation, i.e. multi-meter, load tester, RFL, TDR, and capacitance testers.  Having the ability to properly troubleshoot an aircraft will greatly increase having one piece of equipment to perform five tests, only requiring to go to PMEL once a year, as opposed to having to send five pieces of equipment once a year.

Market research was conducted for the purchase of this 900AST Advance Systems Electrical Tester and 3M Company is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 4:00PM EST on Tuesday, July 5, 2007, the award for this Advance Systems Electrical Tester will be made to 3M Company.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Purchase of Human Exposure Small Analysis System
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with  Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc, 27 Forge Parkway, Franklin, MA to purchase  a Human Exposure Small Analysis System (HESAS) for the Office of Research and Development/National Health & Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)/Human Studies Division in Chapel Hill, NC.  

The Human Exposure Small Analysis System (HESAS),  is a system of pollutant analyzers that measures pollutant levels in the Human Studies Facility exposure chambers.  The HESAS is a part of the Pollutant Control System (PCS) which controls with high precision the level of pollutant(s) in the chamber(s) at all times through a computer software driven control system.  The current computer software program that controls the HESAS is a proprietary program written to communicate with various other PCS analyzers manufactured by TEI.  Therefore, it would require extensive re-writing of the computer program to accept data from other analyzers made by other manufacturers.  TEI is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because the HESAS is comprised of a number of analytical techniques which are in complete communication through a single and unique Ethernet protocol, allowing operation, monitoring, and troubleshooting of all components by a single computer with any current Windows OS and system operator.  There is no other known source that  makes both total hydrocarbon and NO-NO2-NOx analyzers, and no other known source makes their whole line of analyzers with common components which minimize spares.

The minimum allowable distance when fumigating to adjacent to live tree seedbeds is sixteen feet. The minimum soil temperature allowable at 6 inches for any fumigation work is 50 degrees F. 3. The MC 33 fumigant is to be injected with tractor-mounted equipment to a depth of 6 to 8 inches with the delivering chisels spaced not more than 12 inches apart on the drawbar. Injector equipment shall include metering valves, gauges and other equipment to accurately deliver to the fumigant through the chisels at the rate of 350-360 lbs fumigant per acre. 4. In the same operation, soil being fumigated is to be covered simultaneously with polyethylene tarpaulins (minimum of 1 mil thickness). The tarpaulins are to be laid down and sealed automatically by a tarpaulin-layer attached to the rear of the fumigation equipment. 5. The directional line of travel for an area to be fumigated will be determined by government officials at the time of fumigation. 6. When turning around
at end of beds, the tool bar on fumigation apparatus should not cover adjacent live tree seedling beds, as seedling damage may result. 7. The "continuous fumigation and tarping system" shall be employed. The procedure used in this system starts with completion of the first pass, the automatic tarpaulins are laid and covered with soil at least six inches deep in one continuous operation. In the second and succeeding passes, the automatic equipment is adjusted to open furrow only along the advancing edge of the fumigated strip into which the forward edge of the new tarpauling is laid and buried. Ends of tarpaulins shall be buried a minimum of six inches deep in a previously prepared ditch. 8. The second and succeeding passes are made contiguous to the immediately preceding one resulting in a solid uninterrupted tarpaulin covered field extending forward from where the first strip of land was fumigated and covered, with no unfumigated strips intervening. The automatic equipment deposits glue along the top of the forward edge of the previously buried tarpaulin. The trailing edge of the new tarpaulin is placed on top of and pressed against the glued portion of the previously laid tarpaulin and thus secured. The tarpaulins are to remain in place over the fumigated soil for a minimum of 96 hours. Any unglued seams or breaks in tarpaulin will be sealed with gas-proof repair prior to making a new strip. 9. When a fumigant cylinder has been emptied, this point will be designated on the ground. 10. Priorities of areas to be fumigated will depend upon soil temperatures and moisture regimes. INSPECTION A. The Government will inspect work areas prior to application of fumigant to insure adequate moisture and soil temperature. B. Inspection will be made for treatment of 100% of the areas designated for fumigation, amount of fumigant applied, and compliance with safety provisions. MEASUREMENT AND PAYMENT A. Measurement 1. If the tarpaulins become unglued or experience large tears within 18 hours after fumigant injection, the contractor will be notified and payment will be reduced as to total square feet exposed by the tarpaulin becoming detached. 2. Exact acreages will be determined by both parties upon completion of project by on-the-ground measurement. B. Altered Quantities It is mutually agreed that it is inherent in the nature of this contract that some changes in the number of acres as provided in the Schedule may be necessary during the course of the contract and that it is in the scope of the contract to recognize a normal and expected margin of change within the meaning of Clause 52.243-1, Changes, as not requiring or permitting any adjustment of contract prices, except:(1)when the number of acres is increased to more than 125% of the quantity stated in the Schedule, then either party of the contract, upon demand, may be entitled to an equitable adjustment on that portion above 25% of the quantity stated in the Schedule: or (2) when the number of acres of the contract is reduced to less than 75% of the quantity stated in the Schedule, then either party to the contract, upon demand, may be entitled to an equitable adjustment for the quantity of acres actually accepted. Fumigation Contract Specifications, Appendix. FIELD 8 IS APPROXIMATELY 3.5 ACRES, FIELD 9 IS APPROXIMATELY 5 ACRES, FIELD 14 IS APPROXIMATELY 3.5 ACRES. EVALUATION FACTORS.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a contractor to re-develop and enhance the user-friendliness of its E-Filing system prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation OSC-RFQ- 035-07-002 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR 13. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17 (15 May 2007) The North American Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541512 ? Computer Systems Design Services and the small business size standard of $21 million.  This acquisition is set-aside 100% for small businesses. 

INTERACTIVE TUTORIAL TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS IN E-FILING:
 With the U.S. Office of Special Counsel
Program Goals and Objectives
The Office of Special Counsel is a small independent agency that investigates claims of prohibited personnel practices and other violations of the merit system in the federal government.  Federal employees can file an online claim with OSC, alleging one or more of the 12 prohibited personnel practices, by filling out OSC Form 11 and submitting it.  

OSC wants to make the process easier and more ?customer friendly? by enhancing the interactivity of the online complaint filing process through development of an interface that would guide the complainant through the process, offering helpful hints and assistance along the way.  

OSC is soliciting help from a developer who can not only add explanatory text and possible oral explanations to the online complaint process, but can also enhance the current overall complaint filing process by making it smooth, interactive, and easy to use.  The user should have a similar experience to using a product such as Turbo-Tax, which walks the user through a series of screens until all the desired information is captured.  

Note: The content of the screens should be easily modifiable by the OSC staff that will have responsibility to administer the tool and update content.  The offeror will provide on-site training to OSC staff at the Washington DC offices of OSC.

Portions of the work shall be performed at the offices of OSC; however the Contractor shall provide all needed equipment, telecommunications, and materials to complete the requirements of the contract.

II. Evaluation: 

Offers will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) contractor qualifications and technical capability, (2) past performance, and (3) price.  Contractor qualifications/technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.

 The Government plans to make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the requirements herein and represents the greatest or best value to the Government. However, this request in no way obligates OSC to award a contract, nor does it commit OSC to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the quotes. 

Office of Special Counsel anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract not to exceed the ceiling price of $40,000. 

If required by OSC, the Contractor shall provide the required services in individually negotiated fixed-price task orders.  The scope of the task orders may include, but is not limited to, providing consultation, training, support, and other advisory activities as assigned by OSC.  (FAR 16.105, FAR 52.216.1) If task orders are required, each task order associated with this contract will be individually negotiated as funds allow.   	


III.	STATEMENT OF WORK:
III.IV.	STATEMENT OF WORK:

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel is seeking quotes from qualified organizations interested in providing the services described in the Statement of Work (SOW) below.

?XIf audio is needed, audio recording file format will be in MP3.
Create web-based user interface and utility for OSC to modify the contents of the displayed texts and possible audio recordings.
?XCreate User Manual and On-Line Context Sensitive Help
?XProvide instructions on recording/generating MP3 audio files



1. Requirements Analysis Activities

1.1 Perform Detailed Requirements Analysis:

The Contractor will review the functional requirements provided by OSC?s Complaints Examining Unit (CEU) and detail them out to a level sufficient for the Analysis and Design activity.  The resulting requirements may take the form of Use Cases, Specification documents, or some other form that provides the most benefit to the team.

Deliverables
?PDetailed Requirements


1.2 Analysis and Design:
1.2.1  Define User Experience Prototypes and Models:
The Contractor will develop story boards to describe the application user experience (component screens and navigation models) based upon the requirements gathered and documented by the Contractor lead Analyst, and including industry best practices for design.

Deliverables
?Component screens
?Navigation maps / models for areas with complex navigation
?Field validation and data element rules

1.2.2  Create Detailed Design:
The Contractor Design Team will create the detailed design models.

The detailed design will also support the creation of the test plans and test cases that will be used during unit testing.

Deliverables
?Design models which include all of the following:
oStatic structure (class) diagrams
oInteraction (sequence) diagrams
oProcess flow diagrams

1.2.3  CEU Review & Signoff:
OSC?s CEU is responsible for providing feedback for the Detailed Requirements Analysis and for reviewing the Analysis and Design artifacts to ensure the solution proposed meets their needs.  On completion of this review CEU will sign off on the Requirements, Analysis and Design.  

After this sign off, development will start.  All subsequent changes to the initial scope as defined here may require a Change Management review but will not increase the cost or scope of the work.

Deliverables
?CEU Sign Off sheet


1.3 Development:

Contractor staff will develop and will unit test the code written during this project.

1.3.1  .NET Development:
The .NET development tool used will be Visual Studio .NET 2005.  Other Microsoft development tools may be used as necessary.

Contractor will document each component created using XML comments consistent with current Microsoft guidelines. In addition, each component documented shall also be delivered using the Microsoft Office suite of tools (for example, MS WORD, MS EXCEL, MS POWERPOINT, MS PROJECT, or MS ACCESS format). During development, standards will be followed and code reviewed as detailed in the ?Code / Design Reviews and Standards? section.

Deliverables
?PCoded, documented, compiled, and tested modules or components
?PTesting modules and scripts


1.3.2  Code / Design Reviews and Standards:
At the start of the project, Contractor Lead Developer will provide OSC development guidelines, and best practices applicable to the development effort.

The Contractor Lead Developer (LD) will lead all informal code and design reviews. In order to minimize impact to the team, reviews will only involve those team members actually involved in that part of the coding.  The Contractor LD will review the code and design to ensure user experience, naming, documentation, architecture and design standards are followed.

1.4  Stabilization Activities:
1.4.1  Functional Testing:
Contractor will perform due diligence to ensure that all components are integration tested and functionally evaluated against the requirements documentation and pass the unit and functional tests. 

The Contractor Lead Analyst will lead the development of the test cases, as well as the execution of the tests themselves.

1.4.2  Test Case Testing: 
Contractor will also conduct Test Case testing of the complete tutorial after the components are tested and ensure that the integrated solution meets the requirements.  In order to keep the project on schedule and moving along rapidly, fixes for issues found in Test Case Testing will be addressed immediately and retested by Contractor.  

1.5  Deployment:

Contractor will provide OSC?s Complaints Examining Unit the ability to access work in progress at the end of each one-week iteration.  The form will be the code base and relevant artifacts (or other artifacts appropriate to the implementation) outlining the necessary steps required to get the feature up and running just as it does in the demo web site. 

Contractor will provide deployment & delivery mechanism for the final work product.


2.  Configuration/Change Management

OSC?s Contracting Officer and representatives from OSC?s Management and Budget Division and OSC?s Complaints Examining Unit and one representative from the Contractor will constitute a Configuration/Change Management Board.  If during the Statement of Work execution, a requirement, feature, or other change is deemed necessary, the representatives will negotiate the alteration.  Alterations may result in amendments to the accepted SOW.

It is anticipated that minor changes may occur to the initial requirements as identified.  This is considered normal fluctuation and should have no impact on this initial SOW.

The Change Management process will take effect after the First Iteration deliverables are presented and OSC signs off on them.  These deliverables will consist of detailed Analysis and Design artifacts based on the requirements.

The contractor shall correct invalid responses as necessary. The contractor shall review all other data collected (ECGs, echocardiograms, medical test results, and existing arsenic data) for clarity and correctness.  Optional Quantities for additional translation, quality assurance and data management up to 200 records may be completed within the
base period of performance.

Final Report & other deliverables: Final report shall be in hard copies with detailed description and record of data collection, translation, and QA procedures used during the study.  The clinical and arsenic exposure data bases shall be submitted in the form of computer disks or other electronic forms.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to change the requirement from a ?Trace Explosive Analyzer? to a ?Gas Chromatograph with Electron Capture Detector,? and the specifications have been modified.

To support the development of standards for trace explosive detection, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Gas Chromatograph with an Electron Capture Detector to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, Analytical Microscopy Group, at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, to analyze and quantify trace amounts of explosive compounds.

The mission of NIST, as mandated by Congress, is to develop and promote measurements, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improve the quality of life.  Reliable standards are needed to test the performance and effectiveness of trace explosive detectors, which protect the public and infrastructure of the U.S.  Currently, NIST has an active program in trace detection metrology using state-of-the-art microanalytical instrumentation, ion mobility spectrometers, and inkjet printers for the development of trace explosive reference materials. This program is designed to meet the measurement quality needs of organizations and agencies that use trace explosive detectors. A critical requirement for NIST is to validate the quantities of trace explosives on samples such as test swipes and reference materials. For this purpose, NIST has several systems in place, but these systems lack the sensitivity and precision needed for validating deposits of trace explosives at picogram levels.  Gas chromatography with electron capture detection is currently considered the best technology for the purpose. 

All interested Contractor?s shall provide a quote for the following line items(s):

Line Item 0001:  The contractor shall furnish one (1) each, gas chromatograph with electron capture detector.

The analyzer shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

1.	The system must be able to analyze microliter-sized liquids for trace explosives.
2.	The following analytes must be separable and detectable below 10 picograms in mass, and below 10 micrograms per liter in acetonitrile: cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (RDX), pentaerythritol-tetranitrate (PETN), and trinitrotoluene (TNT).  Please note other specific analytes and performance criteria under ?Stronger Considerations? below.
3.	For all required analytes, reproducibility of signals (relative standard deviation of the mean) at the 10 picogram level must be better than 2 percent.
4.	Documentation must be provided regarding system sensitivity (limits of detection, SEE NOTE 1) and analytical precision to the analytes named above.  This documentation may be either in commercial specification sheets or test reports. The purpose is to establish the sensitivity limits that will be used during acceptance tests (described below). If the required data cannot be provided within the solicitation period, NIST is willing to consider other information that addresses sensitivity to explosives or related compounds, as long as the technical procedure utilized by the vendor for determining this information is referenced or adequately described.
5.	The system must be operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

NOTE 1: The limit of detection (LOD) is commonly accepted as the smallest amount of a particular substance that can be reliably detected in a given type of medium by a specific measurement process. The analytical signal from this amount must be high enough above background variations to give statistical confidence that the signal is real, so the LOD is normally defined as the amount of substance that generates an average signal three times higher than the standard deviation of the background signal or analytical signal at LOD levels, whichever is greater.

Installation/Training/Warranty:

1.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate installation/set-up.  Installation, at a minimum, shall include uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of the instrument, demonstration of all required specifications, and removal of trash. Onsite installation and demonstration shall be done at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.

2.  The contractor shall schedule and facilitate one (1) eight hour training session for up to five (5) technicians at NIST.  The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions, maintenance, data administration, and basic troubleshooting.  The training may be completed at NIST immediately after installation and demonstration of performance specifications, but no later than 30 days after installation.  The contractor shall provide a list of installation requirements, including house services and furniture, with explanations, as soon as the contract is awarded.  NIST will provide any required connections to house services.

3.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation, and a one-year warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and travel/labor on-site should this become necessary within the warranty period.

Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to design specifications.
      a.  System utilizes gas chromatography and electron capture detection.
      b.  The system is operable through MS Windows-compatible software to display, analyze, and record data.

2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.
      a.  Using trace explosive materials supplied by NIST, the system will be required to detect any of the required analytes at twice the LOD (or similar level) as specified by the supplier. 
      b.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and will be witnessed by the contractor. The instrument must accurately identify each analyte. Upon any failure, the test for that analyte will be repeated five times. Accurate detection must occur in at least four (4) of those five analyses. 

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the contractor?s commercial schedule.

FOB Destination means:  The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001, for check-in.  Shipping and Receiving shall divert the contractor to NIST?s Health Physics Division, Building 245 (Radiation Physics), Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001, for assaying of package, prior to delivery to the end user.

Award shall be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor ?Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement,? 2) Past Performance, 3) Past Experience, and 4) Price.  Technical capability, past performance, and past experience, when combined, shall be more important than price.  If technical capability, past performance, and past experience are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

***Award will be made on a best-value basis.  Under the Technical Capabilities factor, additional consideration will be given for a system with one or more of the following additional features or capabilities:

Line Item 0001:

Stronger considerations
Stronger considerations beyond the minimum technical requirements will be based upon (in descending order): 1) superior (smaller) limits of detection for the required analytes; 2) superior reproducibility (smaller imprecision) of detection for the required analytes; 3) superior scope of detection, where the following additional analytes are examples: Triacetone triperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), Octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN).

<RESPDATE>070207
<ARCHDATE>08312007
<CONTACT>Sarah-Jane Allen, 703-428-4862
<DESC>W911W4-07-R-0010 Counterintelligence Badges Amendment II as at 27 June 2007 The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: 1. Visual Anti-Counterfeit Technology Question 1: Item 6 in the section 1.1 Badge Design references this modification, 'Embedded into the face of the badge, uniquely designed, visual, anti-counterfeit technology.' Answer 1: Embedded in this sense means the same as permanently affixed to - or fastened to so that if an attempt is make to remove the item from the face of the badge it will cause damage.  Examples of possible visual technologies include 'panels' (affixed ) to the badge face, and a hologram pasted/glued to the face of the badge. Our market research shows that there are various general visual anti-counterfeit technologies available. These are just two examples, and are not designated as specific. That is, any anti-counterfeit technology that covers the requirements can be submitted.  Bottom line for how visual it needs to be - when displayed, the anti-counterfeit technology should be seen from a distance of about 2-3 feet, which is about the distance between people when conducting a meeting where an agent would have to display their ba dge to another individual.  The anti-counterfeit technology needs to be seen on the face of the badge.  2. Armys Current Badge Design Question 2: Is it possible to view the badge referenced for design replication? 'The Contractor will exactly replicate the Army's current Military Intelligence (MI) badge design&' Answer 2: This office does have a smaller copy of this badge for viewing purposes. Please contact Sarah-Jane Allen at email: sarahjane.allen@mi.army.mil for further details. 3. Metal Thickness Contradiction Question 3: 2. Page 3 of the solicitation shows a contradiction regarding the metal thickness required.  .064' is 16 gauge and 12 - 14 guage is .102 - .080' thick.  The 12-14 guage would be more typical  for the shield, perhaps the .064 is reference to app lied panels if used? Answer 3: If 12-14 gauge is the true industry standard this will apply. The .064 thickness was taking directly from the previous market research and it was thought to be industry standard but it does not apply to the thickness of the panels. Also, there is  no requirement for anti-counterfeit technology thickness. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
