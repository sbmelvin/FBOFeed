<DESC><p>The Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) is required to replace the AN/TPS-75 radar as the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander through the Ground Theater Air Control System. The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, and theater ballistic missile detection. The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions. In the case of theater missile defense operations, the new radar will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes such as the USAF Control and Reporting Center to disseminate for warning and engagement. Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, which will include launch and impact location. The 3DELRR will correct current radar system shortfalls by providing the capability to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets as well as classify and determine the type of a non-cooperative aircraft. It will also mitigate most of the sustainability and maintainability concerns which plague the current system.</p>

ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection
process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may
refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an
ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements,
and/ or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an
ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency
level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no
authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to
request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.
Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

In addition, the Bureau of Reclamation requires the following features and services: (1.) A web-based TV search engine application, accessible 24x7 within 120 seconds, licensed to the end-user with the largest "real-time" broadcast content catalog available anywhere; (2.) Includes more than 500 television channels; (3.) On-the-fly integration of Nielsen's estimated audience size and publicity values for measurement and analysis; (4.) Full-motion (30 frames per second) at a bit rate of 240 kbps or higher; (5.) A "Report Builder" tool for the dynamic generation of web pages that can include over 500 segments of TV and over 24 hours of video including the aggregate sums of audience estimates, and the ability to add Consumer Generated Video from YouTube into the mentioned web reports; (6.) Self-service download tool for archiving video clips including web resolution in all video markets and broadcast quality video (DVD quality) for the major programs; and (7.) Historic Closed Caption text searches going back to January 1, 2005.  Firms believing they can meet the stated Bureau of Reclamation requirements must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet these stated requirements.  This is not a request for competitive quotes and no solicitation will be issued.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  The Bureau of Reclamation will consider all affirmative responses received no later than August 20, 2008, by noon (12:00 p.m.) Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Molecular Profiling Core and installation (CMPC) plans to procure as a sole source the brand Qiagen BioRobot 8000 Upgrade from Qiagen Inc.; 27220 Turnberry Ln., Suite 200; Valencia, California 91355-1005.

The supplies are herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Part I.  Background Information and Description of Acquisition:

The Clinical Molecular Profiling Core (CMPC) will develop and implement state of the art genomic technologies thereby maximizing the clinical benefits and biological insights derived from the analysis of biospecimens obtained from the NCI clinical trials. The CMPC requires the capability to handle minute amounts of liquid (uL scale) to create customized storage and reaction plates. This would remove a current blockage in the core’s workflow for DNA sequencing using capillary sequencers and allow for increased throughput testing. This liquid handling capability would also allow us to setup and efficiently carry out PCR reactions at a larger scale. 

The Qiagen BioRobot 8000 molecular biology workstations are the ideal match for modern capillary sequencers. BioRobots provide fast and reliable high-throughput, front-end sample preparation , and liquid handling using proven Qiagen chemistries and innovative, patent pending technologies.

	Part II.   Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:

Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41   U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) 	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need. 

The CMPC requires the capability to handle minute amounts of liquid (uL scale) in purposeful ways to create customized storage and reaction plates. The BioRobot has this capability. The Robot possesses an efficient contaminant removal using a patent-pending automated vacuum system allowing CMPC personnel to purify up to sixteen 96-well plates per work day; this allows for increased throughput testing in the CMPC. 

This upgrade must be compatible with the current Qiagen BioRobot 8000 liquid handling robot already stationed in the lab. Qiagen is the only known vendor to the NCI who can provide this instrument because they only providers of the software upgrades and trained technicians possessing the knowledge and skills to service this equipment. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on August 29, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Malinda Holdcraft: holdcram@exchange.nih.gov. It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-80177-NG on all correspondence.

<p><strong>A.2 BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates two (2) Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. On aircraft N42RF, the engine in the #3 position (S/N OTH8546) was removed for compressor surge during shift from HSGI (flight idle) to LSGI (high speed ground idle). Further investigation revealed curled tips of the 5th and 10th stage compressor rotor blades and degraded engine efficiency. <br /><strong>A.3 SCOPE</strong><br />The Contractor shall agree to accept the engine in the Quick Engine Change (QEC), mounted on an AOC owned engine stand. The Contractor shall perform a test cell run evaluation of the engine and provide the results to the AOC. The Contractor shall provide all the necessary special tools and labor to remove the accessories and the engine from the QEC, (CLIN 0001). The Contractor shall perform a teardown of the engine power section and shall provide AOC with a detailed tear down report. The Contractor shall remove and replace or overhaul the existing compressor assembly to 0.0-hour Technical Standard Order (TSO), whichever is more cost effective. The requirement to repair (CLIN 0002 - Option One) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The requirement to replace (CLIN 0003, Option 2) will be based on the teardown report and analysis conducted under CLIN 0001. The Contractor shall reinstall the engine assembly into the QEC and perform a test cell run. Test cell run results will be evaluated by the AOC before acceptance of the engine for return to service. Maximum acceptable vibration levels of the engine upon completion of work will be discussed prior to the commencement of the contract. Under this agreement the contractor shall complete the work within twenty (20) working days after receipt of the engine at the contractor facility. The contractor shall comply with any outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and provide the AOC with any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. The Contractor will be responsible for all, Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) and AOC required documentation, to include but not limited to, approval for return to service. No additional work shall be performed on any engine without prior approval from the CO. <br />A.3.1 Over and Above Discrepancies (CLIN 0004) is defined as any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria that are discovered during performance of the work. The findings will be documented in a written report that includes parts required, labor required and a cost estimate for additional work. The Contractor shall not proceed with the additional work until approval for additional work is received from the Contracting Officer. The work shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's repair/overhaul manuals. Over and above shall be on a time and materials basis.<br />A.3.2.1 NOAA will select the Option for the repair or replacement (CLIN 0002 or CLIN 0003) within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written report/analysis. The Government is not obligated to select an option if doing so is found not to be in the Government's best interest and or funds are not available. If an option is selected, the selection will be formalized by modification to the contract. <br />A.4 DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS: The cost of shipping the engine to the contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government. Return transportation will be the responsibility of the contractor. <br />A.5 INSURANCE AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE TO GOVERNMENT PROPERTY: The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain liability insurance of not less than $750,000.00 to cover the engine on which this work will be performed. Before award of this contract, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective: <br />1. For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe and;<br />2. Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, <br />whichever period is longer.</p>
<p>A.6 PARTS, DISCOUNTS AND WARRANTIES: The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the engine. Parts or components in an "as removed" condition will not be installed in the engine. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. Secondly, contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price for replacement parts will be given. As the AOC WP-3D aircraft average only 350 per year, the Contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of five hundred hours flight time or eighteen (18) months from the time of installation of the engine.</p>
<p>A.7 FAA CERTIFICATION: Maintenance contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the service is an FAA or factory (Rolls Royce) approved repair station for the T56-A-14 engine and have performed overhauls and test cell runs on this type unit within the last 90 days.</p>

NUWCDIV Newport intends to award a fixed price contract with Berkut Systems for maintenance and support of the Sailormail Email System, which provides email capability for the submarine force until traditional Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) delivery is available during underway periods.  500 hours of effort is expected.  The basic contract will be for 12 months with an option for an additional year.  The basis for the sole source is that Berkut Systems originally developed the Sailormail system and is the only one qualified to update the software and provide relevant training.  They are the sole proprietor of all source code for the system.  

The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The US Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Office of Aviation (INL/A) intends to issue an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with McTurbine, Inc., 401 Junior Beck Drive, Corpus Christi, TX 78405-4411.      

INL/A has two distinct requirements for the Honeywell commercial T53-L-703 engine.  The first requirement is derived from INL/A’s Huey II retrofit program.  Part of the Huey II retrofit program requires the conversion of the existing T53-L-13B or military T53-L-703 power sections to be converted to the Honeywell commercial T53-L-703 standard.  The second requirement is to also convert presently installed military T53-L-13B or military T53-L-703 power sections in the UH-1H fleet to the commercial Honeywell T53-L-703 standard.   The current 40+ year old military specification T53-L-13B and T53-L-703 engines require conversion / replacement due to:

•	Military T53-L-13B engines are no longer being manufactured and are considered obsolete 
•	Minimal parts and spares availability for repairs 
•	Substantially increased costs for scarcely available parts / spares
•	Lack of updated technical publications and procedures
•	Increased man-hours to maintain
•	Reduced technical engineering support / Safety of Flight coverage 
•	Degraded performance not adequate for mission flight profile 
•	Safety risk to flight crew and passengers
•	Decreased mission availability 

The remaining commercial T53-L-703 model engines will be maintained as OEM spare and or damage replacement engines for INL/A’s and other federal agency helicopter fleet requirements over the next five years of operation.

Honeywell is the only manufacture of commercial engines that are Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) approved for installation on the aircraft types listed under paragraph 1 above. McTurbine Inc. is the only CONUS based Honeywell licensed conversion and overhaul facility available.   For the UH-1H, installation of the commercial Honeywell T53-L-703 will remedy the issue listed above and is the only option available to keep INL/A’s UH-1H helicopters flyable.  Additionally, it will significantly reduce the current high risk of operating and maintaining the military T53-L-13B engine and standardize our entire Bell single engine helicopter fleet to one commercially supportable engine, the T53-L-703.  

An IDIQ contract for 65 engines and technical services will result from this action.  The IDIQ contract will have a minimum ordering amount of one unit and maximum of 65 engines over a five year period of performance.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineer Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. 
	
St. Elizabeths Hospital was established in 1855 as the first Federal government hospital for people with mental illnesses.  Its early mission, as defined by one of its founders, Dorothea Dix, was to provide the most humane care and enlightened curative treatment for the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.  The site, which sits on over 300 acres, is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) and includes a significant collection of historic buildings dating from the 1850’s through the early 20th century.  The Center Building, which is the focus of this project, was built as the primary structure for the hospital and it is a very large Gothic Revival building complex composed of a series of additions and wings of brick masonry construction with stone detailing.  The NHL also features a number of significant landscape components with the ornamental and therapeutic landscape surrounding the Center Building as one of the primary contributing landscape areas.   Other landscape components include woodland areas, former agricultural fields and a graveyard for American Civil War Soldiers and patients of St. Elizabeths.  Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue bisects the site into a West Campus and an East Campus.  The East Campus was deeded to the District of Columbia in 1987.  The Federal government maintains control over 176 acres of land and approximately 61 buildings that comprise the West Campus.  The West Campus provides a rich collection of historic buildings, landscapes and open spaces, in addition to extraordinary views and vistas from the National Historic Landmark site.

GSA contracted with Jones Lang LaSalle to assist in the preparation of a Master Plan for the development of St. Elizabeths as a high security campus for DHS.  While the process is still ongoing, the current version of the Master Plan may be viewed at http://www.stelizabethswestcampus.com.  The exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project, including the phases that are identified herein, are still being discussed and explored through public consultation required by the NHPA.  GSA endeavors to procure the services of an Architect/Engineer (A/E) so that upon completion of the Master Planning process, the final approved project may proceed without undue delay.

The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on the higher-end projections as currently under development in the Master Plan.  Pending the Master Plan approval, GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the size of the ultimate project, its complex environmental and historic preservation challenges and the potential impact on contributing resources, GSA will require the services of our nation’s most talented A/E firms.  

The GSA is seeking A/E Design Services for the DHS Headquarters Building, the National Operations Center (NOC), and shared use spaces. Regardless of the eventual size, the facilities will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals, including new standards mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), and Executive Order 13423.  In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by DHS, the A/E will be required to design the facilities and site to meet stringent federal security requirements.  The facilities will be designed in metric (system international) units, and will achieve a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating.  The buildings will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The estimated construction cost is between approximately $250,000,000 and $450,000,000.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
The project may provide up to approximately 1,462,450 GSF of historic adaptive use and new construction to serve the needs of tenant agencies.  It should make a distinct architectural statement that will be consistent with the Master Plan as approved per the NEPA and NHPA processes, and in accordance with design and landscape guidelines.  It will also incorporate cost-effective and innovative “green” strategies in order to ensure that GSA and/or DHS meet, or exceed, energy reduction goals and mandates.

The scope of A/E services will include: master planning; architecture; civil, geotechnical, structural (to include seismic and blast design), mechanical and electrical engineering; historic restoration and rehabilitation including exterior envelope and interior spaces, and landscape preservation and adaptive use; communications; space planning and systems furniture integration; interior design; fire protection; food service; site and landscape design; scheduling; cost engineering; value engineering; administrative coordination and integration of the various disciplines involved; construction phase services and computer aided design (CAD) documentation including building information modeling (BIM), and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 
All design development will be required to comply with the approved Master Plan, National Environmental Policy Act, and Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act.  Submissions will include a report identifying preservation design issues, alternatives, and solutions as they are developed, justifying the recommended approach.

The goals for this procurement are as follows: a Program Development Study (PDS) to define the project requirements and establish a firm construction budget; develop space solutions for the future tenants; fully engage those tenants in the planning, design, and construction of new buildings and adaptive use of historic buildings; maintain and enhance the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; balance historic preservation and historic adaptive use with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting and specimen flora that contribute to the site’s National Historic Landmark designation; respect, incorporate and interpret the significance of St. Elizabeths past; pursue a good neighbor policy with the local community; subscribe to the Design Excellence and Construction Excellence goals; through strategic planning pursue a high level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet the Silver LEED rating; plan and design to promote the natural views and vistas of the Washington DC area and St. Elizabeths; consider and use life cycle costs as a design factor; pursue a high level of energy and water savings through innovative design initiatives; extensively incorporate low impact development (LID) strategies, such as bio-retention for storm water management; enhance landscape design to achieve wind and visual screening and solar shading; engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities that will accomplish adaptive use and preservation of historic structures and site; and integrate the design of site security elements with building setback and barrier requirements through the use of knee walls, road alignments, aesthetic fences and building positions.

SELECTION PROCESS: 
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of Lead Designers and associated A/E Design Firms. The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: 

STAGE I: 
The first stage will establish the experience and capabilities of the Lead Designer and associated A/E Design Firm.  The A/E Design Firm as used in this solicitation means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering.

SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE:  SEE SUBCONTRACTING GOALS UNDER STAGE II. 
 
Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineer Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. 
	
St. Elizabeths Hospital was established in 1855 as the first Federal government hospital for people with mental illnesses.  Its early mission, as defined by one of its founders, Dorothea Dix, was to provide the most humane care and enlightened curative treatment for the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.  The site, which sits on over 300 acres, is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) and includes a significant collection of historic buildings dating from the 1850’s through the early 20th century.  The proposed location for the subject projects is the southern portion of the West Campus in an area that was the focus of the second major phase of construction of hospital buildings during the early decades of the 20th century.  Much of the historic building stock in the project area was designed by the noted Boston architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge.  The landscape surrounding the historic building stock is considered significant as a contributing component to the NHL as an ornamental and therapeutic landscape.   The project area is also located in a very sensitive visual area within the Washington metropolitan core as the wooded slopes that lie to the west of the subject area are a part of what is called the “Washington Topographic Bowl” – the wooded hillsides that are visible from many locations within the metropolitan core.  

Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue bisects the site into a West Campus and an East Campus.  The East Campus was deeded to the District of Columbia in 1987.  The Federal government maintains control over 176 acres of land and approximately 61 buildings that comprise the West Campus.  The West Campus provides a rich collection of historic buildings, landscapes and open spaces, in addition to extraordinary views and vistas from the National Historic Landmark site. 

GSA contracted with Jones Lang LaSalle to assist in the preparation of a Master Plan for the development of St. Elizabeths as a high security campus for DHS.  While the process is still ongoing, the current version of the Master Plan may be viewed at http://www.stelizabethswestcampus.com.  The exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project, including the phases that are identified herein, are still being discussed and explored through public consultation required by the NHPA.  GSA endeavors to procure the services of an Architect/Engineer (A/E) so that upon completion of the Master Planning process, the final approved project may proceed without undue delay.

The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on the higher end projections as currently under development in the Master Plan.  Pending the Master Plan approval, GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the size of the ultimate project, its complex environmental and historic preservation challenges and the potential impact on contributing resources, GSA will require the services of our nation’s most talented A/E firms.  

The GSA is seeking A/E Design Services for the FEMA Headquarters Building. Design Services for Headquarters Facilities for ICE, CBP and TSA will be options.  Regardless of the eventual size, the facilities will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals, including new standards mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), Executive Order 13423.  In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by DHS, the A/E will be required to design the facilities and site to meet stringent federal security requirements.  The facilities will be designed in metric (system international) units, and will achieve a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating.  The buildings will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The estimated construction cost is between approximately $175,000,000 and $445,000,000. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 
The project may provide up to approximately 1,700,000 GSF (excluding parking) of new construction and historic adaptive use to serve the needs of tenant agencies.  It should make a distinct architectural statement that will be consistent with the Master Plan as approved per the NEPA and NHPA processes, and in accordance with design and landscape guidelines.  It will also incorporate cost-effective and innovative “green” strategies in order to ensure that GSA and/or DHS meet, or exceed, energy reduction goals and mandates.

The scope of A/E services will include: master planning; architecture; civil, geotechnical, structural (to include seismic and blast design), mechanical and electrical engineering; historic restoration and rehabilitation including exterior envelope and interior spaces, and landscape preservation and adaptive use; communications; space planning and systems furniture integration; interior design; fire protection; food service; site and landscape design; scheduling; cost engineering; value engineering; administrative coordination and integration of the various disciplines involved; construction phase services and computer aided design (CAD) documentation including building information modeling (BIM), and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 
All design development will be required to comply with the final Master Plan, National Environmental Policy Act, and Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act.  Submissions will include a report identifying preservation design issues, alternatives, and solutions as they are developed, justifying the recommended approach.

The goals for this procurement are as follows: a Program Development Study (PDS) to define the project requirements and establish a firm construction budget; develop space solutions for the future tenants; fully engage those tenants in the planning, design, and construction of new buildings and adaptive use of historic buildings; maintain and enhance the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; balance historic preservation and historic adaptive use with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting and specimen flora that contribute to the site’s National Historic Landmark designation; respect, incorporate and interpret the significance of St. Elizabeths past; pursue a good neighbor policy with the local community; subscribe to the Design Excellence and Construction Excellence goals; through strategic planning pursue a high level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet the Silver LEED rating; plan and design to promote the natural views and vistas of the Washington DC area and St. Elizabeths; consider and use life cycle costs as a design factor; pursue a high level of energy and water savings through innovative design initiatives; extensively incorporate low impact development (LID) strategies, such as bio-retention for storm water management; enhance landscape design to achieve wind and visual screening and solar shading; engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities that will accomplish adaptive use and preservation of historic structures and site; integrate the design of site security elements with building setback and barrier requirements through the use of knee walls, road alignments, aesthetic fences and building positions; and provide structured parking in lieu of surface parking.

Northern Zone Trade Facilitation Portal Project, El Salvador.  The Grantee (Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development, FUSADES) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct Technical Assistance for the Northern Zone Trade Facilitation Portal Project.

The objective of the Northern Zone Trade Facilitation Portal Technical Assistance is to develop trade facilitation tools that will help link foreign suppliers and investors with projects being developed in the northern region of El Salvador (Northern Zone).  Specifically, the Technical Assistance will include the following components:

1)  The development of a trade facilitation web portal exclusively devoted to opportunities in and information about trade and investment projects in the Northern Zone;

2)  The collection, organization, and population of a comprehensive database of projects in the Northern Zone; especially projects identified under funding from Millennium Challenge Account El Salvador (FOMILENIO), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and other donors.  The database will be overlaid on a user-friendly map application using keyhole markup language (KML) to display trade and investment opportunities in the Northern Zone.  The KML-based map application will enhance the ability of investors to obtain sector and project information at various locations throughout the Northern Zone; and

3)  The organization of three roundtables focused on the trade facilitation web portal and project opportunities in the Northern Zone.  The roundtables will feature specific projects identified by various donors and government agencies, and will include representatives of municipalities and investor groups from the Northern Zone.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source, and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (Antiguo Cuscatlán, El Salvador), October 2, 2008, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD: EVALUATION CRITERIAStatement of Work Request7/29/2008Project: Create New Version of CAPS TrainingDESCRIPTION OF WORK The VA National Center for PTSD currently has a training course for how to administer the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) available on a CDrom created on Macro Media.  The current CD-ROM includes video of a CAPS interview, prompts to rate the individual items and then feedback on the outcome of the ratings.  There are also downloadable written background materials. We would like to make this training available on the VA intranet at vaww.ptsd.va.gov.  We have recently uploaded the CAPS to this intranet site and would like to make the training material available in a user friendly format to be used in conjunction with the assessment.  Expected award will not exceed $25,000.The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assess symptoms over the past week.  In addition to assessing the 17 PTSD symptoms, questions target the impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and frequency and intensity of five associated symptoms (guilt over acts, survivor guilt, gaps in awareness, depersonalization, and derealization).  For each item, standardized questions and probes are provided.  As part of the trauma assessment (Criterion A), the Life Events Checklist is used to identify traumatic stressors experienced. The goal is to adapt the CAPS training CD into an online, interactive educational course that is more engaging than the current document and better suited to appeal to today's clinicians.  The most effective online courses today take advantage of a full range of multimedia techniques including color, movement, sound, video, and engage the learner. We seek a contractor who can satisfy these stated goals.Specifically the course will be designed to instruct clinicians how to use the CAPS assessment.  The course provides information on:  "	Symptoms of PTSD (numbing, hyperarousal, and avoidance)"	How to reliably administer the CAPS to diagnose PTSD"	The essential competencies for administering the CAPS"	Symptoms and diagnostic status over time"	How to determine severity of symptoms"	Evaluation of overall severity and global improvement The course must be 508 compliant per VA regulation 6102. It must also meet technical specifications in order to be uploaded to our intranet website http://vaww.va.gov/webops.  We expect that the amount of time it will take to complete the course will be approximately one hour in length and that the course will be broken into sections that will allow the user to complete the course in multiple sessions.We believe that many of the elements listed below will be necessary in order to satisfy the stated goal, but look to the contractor to specify how to best meet the goals.  Possible elements include:"	Audio voice-over narration "	Photo images and flash-animated collages of still images to personalize and humanize the content and render it more accessible to users "	Interactive exercises (e.g., on recognizing combat stress reactions) to engage the user and ensure content mastery (NOTE: no persistent cookies allowed by VA)"	Inclusion of VA and NCPTSD logosThe course will be tested at the Center to ensure that the module is relevant, accessible, and easy to navigate and then revised based on the Center's feedback.  DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format. Electronic files will be supplied that can be uploaded to the NCPTSD Website and will meet all of the requirements as specified in the description of work above.SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor must have expertise in creating engaging educational trainings and curricula that are web based.  Understanding public information campaigns and branding preferred. Additional expertise in traditional and emerging technologies is required to insure that the course is disseminated effectively.  The contractor must have experience with e-learning and web-based trainings.  Experience translating science into practice preferred. The online Course will be hosted on the VA intranet site accessible to VA employees only. If you have any questions or cannot download the RFP please e-mail POC at stacy.sullivan@va.gov

<DESC><p>A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, Medical Treatment Facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky, seeks to initiate the standardization process for Urology Supplies (Nursing). Standardization for this product line represents a previously standardized initiative, originally completed in March 2003 and expired March 2008. This product line includes a full line of Urology Supplies in various sizes and descriptions, as detailed in 1.a. of the Technical Criteria below; Usage Items.
<p>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<br /><br />The major facilities in the area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky, and US Coast Guard, Traverse City Michigan.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Region's current PV, Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) that supplement the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. The anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for a RIA. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Point of Contact is Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 and phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Urology Supplies (Nursing), which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below (75% of total sales). Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $92,756.46. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top high volume usage lines for this project include: KENDALL HEALTHCARE 6155 CURITY FOLEY CATHETER TRAY,16 $16,157.11; KENDALL HEALTHCARE 8122 CURITY 8000 URINE METER FOLEY $8,432.04; CR BARD 907316 LATEX-FREE FOLEY TRAY $6,399.21; TYCO / KENDALL HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS 6155 CURITY FOLEY CATHETER TRAY,16 $5,331.60; MENTOR 240 STRAIGHT TIPPED-STERILE 14 FR. $2,702.52 KENDALL HEALTHCARE 6154 CURITY FOLEY CATHETER TRAY,18 $2,697.14; MENTOR 486 COUDE TIPPED-STERILE TIEMANN $2,019.50; MEDLINE DYND11519 FOLEY TRAY,100%SIL,16FR,5CC,LA $1,957.35; CR BARD 895916 SILICONE COATED FOLEY CATHETER $1,559.51; CR BARD 897216 100 PCT SILICONE CATH TRAY W/1 $1,500.26; TYCO / KENDALL HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS 6146 100% SILICONE FOLEY TRAY, 16 F $1,464.93; TYCO / KENDALL HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS 6146 100% SILICONE FOLEY TRAY, 16 F $1,397.35; MENTOR 20-00240 SELF CATH FEMALE 6" L, 14F WO/FUNNEL END $1,107.04.</p>
<p>At the request of the Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region and is the deciding officials for this initiative.</p>
<p>The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's "best" tiered-pricing discounts off the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:<br />1. Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting. The vendors' initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.<br />2. The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review. The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.<br />3. The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<br />NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<br />The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria. Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.</p>
<p>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<br />1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Urology Supplies (Nursing) products. A "complete line of product" is defined as the MTF's requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<br />a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: FOLEY CATHETER TRAY,16 Fr; 8000 URINE METER FOLEY TRAY 16 FR; TRAY, 16 Fr. FOLEY, LATEX-FREE; ULTRAMER FOLEY CATHETER TRAY, 16 FR, ANTI-REFLUX DEVICE DRAINAGE BAG; STRAIGHT TIPPED-STERILE 14 FR 6" LONG, FEMALE, SELF-CATH: FOLEY CATHETER TRAY, 18 FR; COUDE TIPPED-STERILE, FOLEY CATH, 8FR; STRAIGHT TI 14 Fr. 6" Funnel End, Female.

WHISTLE TIP CATHETER; URINE METER, 200ML; 2000ml PRECISION URINE METER, DRAIN BAG ONLY; 16L X 16FR., DOVER RED ROBINS, STRAIGHT, CATHETER; LEG BAG, MEDIUM, 20 OZ; 12 FR, 5CC ALL SILICONE; 18 FR. 5CC ALL SILICONE; 20 FR. 5CC ALL SILICONE; 22 FR. 5CC ALL SILICONE; 16L X 10FR., DOVER RED ROBINS, STRAIGHT, CATHETER; TUBE HOLDERS/UROLOGICAL FOLEY (CATHETER LEG-STRAP).<br />b. Vendor MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and types listed above. (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<br />2. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Urology Supply (Nursing) product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<br />3. Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, the prime vendor is Owens &amp; Minor) for distribution of Urology Supplies (Nursing) in the Heartland Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I). Provide supporting documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor with initial submittal.<br />4. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified). Where lower "uncommitted" Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<br />5. Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive products cross-reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format upon request.<br />6. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for the Urology Supplies (Nursing) products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution in response to this RFQ. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<br />7. Vendor must provide a statement confirming their products meet the industry production and safety standards (ASTM standards, FDA regulations) used in manufacturing Urology Supplies (Nursing) products in response to this RFQ.<br />8. Vendors must provide an option to obtain products that are latex-free or otherwise hypo-allergenic. Vendors must ensure that all such latex-free or hypoallergenic products are clearly labeled as such on all exterior and interior packaging, including the individual items. Vendors must provide samples and descriptions of the labeling with the initial submittal.<br />9. Vendors must provide educational tools and materials for Urology Supplies (Nursing) products, and provide evidence of this with the initial submittals. For instance, provide literature on the tools/materials available in response to this RFQ.<br />10. Vendors must provide "antimicrobial coated" Foley catheters. Provide documentation with initial submittal to support. Vendors who do not offer "antimicrobial coated" Foley catheters will be disqualified in Phase 1<br />11. In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide documentation identifying if catheter tubing has a feature for collecting samples under sterile technique and the process for collecting the urine under sterile technique.<br />12. In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide documentation identifying if catheters have a feature for securing it to the patient and how this feature works.<br />13. In response to this RFQ, vendors must provide documentation identifying if collection bags and urine meters have a cap or sleeve to protect the end from contamination as it hangs on the bedside.</p>
<p>Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process:<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation<br />For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>1. Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting using a Likert-like one to five rating scale. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.75 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors' average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors' average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.75, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this evaluation, the drainage tube/urometer/collection bag will be filled with colored water to simulate urine and a clinical manikin or other similar teaching device will be used to simulate patient anatomy. Each of the following criteria will be evaluated a minimum of 5 times each in a non-clinical setting using direct observation and/or a clinical manikin.<br />Catheters <br />1. The catheter advances smoothly and molds to anatomical curves without kinking during insertion.<br />a. Clinicians require a non-kinking catheter that molds to anatomical curves to prevent patient injury during insertion.<br />b. Evaluator observes for smooth catheter insertion without kinking.<br />Collection/Drainage Devices<br />1. Sampling port does not leak during needleless specimen collection.<br />a. Clinicians require a needleless sampling port that seals after sample collection to prevent contamination of the urine drainage system and reducing risk for in patient infection. Prevention of accidental needle sticks (OSHA prevention of blood borne pathogen standard) and decreases the chance of specimen contamination. System should be designed in a way that allows for multiple collections without any leaking developing at access point.<br />b. Evaluator collects urine sample from needleless sampling port and observes for ease of collection and sealing of sampling port (no leakage). This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by simulated fluid collection.<br />2. Urine drainage bag/urometer does not leak when manipulated and/or full. <br />a. Clinicians require a urine drainage bag/urometer that does not leak when manipulated during patient care or when full to reduce the risk of patient infection.<br />b. Evaluator observes urine drainage bag/urometer filled to capacity with colored water for leakage during removing/attaching to bedside, dropping on floor, placed flat in bed, and otherwise manipulated. <br />3. Constructed with leak proof design.<br />a. Collection bags should be designed so clinicians will not worry about urine leaking from the bag onto the floor, the bed, the patient, or the clinician.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by filling the bags with colored water (to simulate urine) and then emptying the device a number of times to simulated use and ensure product does not develop leaks.<br />4. Incremental markings on urimeter allow accurate measurement.<br />a. Sets used in critical care areas should include markings that allow for accurate monitoring of urine levels of under 30cc/hr and have font large enough for easy reading.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting by filling the bags/meters with colored water (to simulate urine) and then visualize to assess accuracy and ease of visualization.</p>
<p>Price Analysis:</p>
<p>1. Price submissions will be requested concurrent to product sample requests. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).<br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?).<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.</p>
<p>Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<DESC><p>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information. The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources of commercial and manufactured items that meet Air Force requirements. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided. The F-16 System Program Office is considering competing select avionic equipment and carries with it special requirements as defined, but not limited to, selection elements noted in the description. Please mail or e-mail responses by COB 25 Aug 2008 to the POCs identified below.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Air Force may release a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the near future for a Digital Airborne Video Transmission System (AVTS) and associated components for the Thunderbird Block 52 Aircraft. This requires a system for each aircraft (9 "C" model aircraft and 2 "D" model aircraft) along with updates to their downlink trailer to replacing their old analog system used with their old Block 32 aircraft.</p>
<p>The required aircraft components include a digital microwave transmitter and two antennae (@ fuselage station 257.90), with lower antenna 7.9 inches to right of baseline. The position of the transmitter will be under panel 2202 mounted on the aircraft band amp rack (now empty). The lower antenna will be attached to a locally manufactured mounting plate. The upper antenna on the F-16C block 52 aircraft will be mounted on panel 3402 (the PDU panel). For the F-16D block 52 aircraft, the upper antenna will be mounted on the turtle shell cone panel 3435 (forward of the PDU panel). A small 50/50 power splitter is also needed to provide an equal distribution to both antennae. All of the proposed components are compatible with existing video/audio equipment ("lip stick" cameras and the Digital Video-Recorder (DVR)). The electrical requirements shall utilize the aircraft power (i.e., 28 VDC) and will be tapped off existing spare circuit breaker of the aft equipment bay DC power panel. Installation time per aircraft is limited to be less than 20 hours by Air Force personnel. The ground station will consist of four receivers, four antennae, and a video switching unit. The end application will allow the user to select video feeds from either the commander/leader's aircraft, slot aircraft, and both solo aircraft. This modification will remain on the aircraft as long as the aircraft are possessed by the Thunderbirds.</p>
<p>Special Considerations</p>
<p>The Government may award a contract to a single integrator/provider of equipment. Contract award decision may be based upon an evaluation of cost and non-cost factors (ie technical capability, past performance etc.). Part manufacturers must be qualified vendors for aircraft avionics components for the F-16. Engineering Proto-type Testing may also be required.</p>
<p>To help identify potential sources and assist industry in better understanding this requirement, the Program Office may support one-on-one discussions/meetings or telecoms with interested contractors. Meetings will be held at Hill AFB and can be scheduled for 2-hr blocks. Please contact the POC's below for reserving an appointment. If circumstances permit site surveys may also be conducted.</p>
<p>RFI</p>
<p>1. Are you a qualified source for F-16 avionic components? If so, by whom are you qualified and for what components? <br />2. What is your experience in providing similar parts? Please provide part numbers and/ or copies of brochures?<br />3. Describe your facilities, transportation, manufacturing, and manpower capabilities and capacity. <br />4. What is your estimated price and lead time for delivery of components and receiver equipment?<br />5. What quality control measures do you currently have in place (ISO 9000, 9001 etc. and which version)? <br />6. Do you have clearances in place to handle proprietary or security sensitive equipment, documents, or information? If so, what level of security clearance do you have?<br />7. The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code being considered for this acquisition is 334220: based on this NAICS code what is your size status. <br />&#61552; Small Business<br />&#61552; Small Disadvantaged <br />&#61552; Women-Owned<br />&#61552; Veteran-Owned<br />&#61552; Service Disabled Veteran Owned<br />&#61552; Hub-zone<br />&#61552; Women-owned business other than Small <br />&#61552; Large Business<br />8. Do you have recommendations for other NAICS code (e.g. 334310, 334290, and 334515) that should be considered? In addition, if you provide a recommended NAICS code include your size status?<br />9. How many employees do you have?<br />10. What is your annual revenue?<br />11. Are you currently registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR)?<br />12. Do you have the capability to comply with Unique Item Description (UID) requirements? <br />13.

<DESC>Card Scanning Service
Request for Information (RFI)
August 15, 2008

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division, Clarksburg, WV, provides identification services based on fingerprints and maintains a national criminal and civil history repository of fingerprint identification information.  Since July 1999, the FBI has performed identification services utilizing the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS).  The IAFIS is designed such that all fingerprint information will be processed electronically in a paperless manner.  The Card Scanning Service (CSS) is a contractor-operated conversion effort overseen by the CJIS Division.  The main purpose of the current CSS contract is to convert hard copy fingerprint cards into electronic format for the IAFIS processing utilizing the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS).  Textual information and fingerprint images are entered using optical character readers, manual entry and high-resolution scanners certified to comply with the FBI Image Quality Specifications (IQS).  The principal deliverables under the current CSS contract are EFTS-formatted messages containing the fingerprint images and textual data which are transmitted to the CJIS Division for IAFIS processing.  Conversion services are billed on a per-card basis.

This contract is expected to be a base year with four option years.  A full range of conversion functions may be required to accomplish this effort.  The purpose of this request for information is to determine the existence and capabilities of competitive contractor sources for conversion services following the completion of the period of performance of the existing CSS contractor efforts.  Future efforts are expected to include the services shown in the following paragraphs.  The anticipated efforts may be procured in a single contract, two contracts dividing the services into current receipts conversion services along with the miscellaneous conversion services and archive conversion services, or multiple awards for the required services.  While the FBI is flexible in the pricing/cost area, capability development is anticipated to be firm-fixed price and scanning services pricing to be on a per card/item basis.  These efforts are currently anticipated to be available to small and large businesses through a full and open competition.  Industry comments on the anticipated acquisition strategy are welcome.

A brief explanation of required services follows.

Current Receipts Conversion Services

Current Receipts Conversion Services begins with the receipt of the hard copy cards from the FBI.  Prior to contractor receipt, the FBI will receive the cards from the contributor, perform a basic quality control check, perform any accounting or tracking functions required by FBI policy, and package the cards for shipment to the conversion facility via the U.S. Mail or private carrier.  The Contractor, upon acceptance of the shipment from the carrier, will perform the balance of the conversion operation.  This typically involves inspecting, data entry, scanning, quality control, and electronic processing and transmission of the resulting Electronic Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS) messages.  While the FBI will provide the data transmission lines and encryption devices, the contractor will be responsible for all internal data processing, storage, transmission, status accounting, billing, and associated security.  The information and processing associated with this effort is considered sensitive but unclassified (SBU) and contains Privacy Act information that requires protection as personally identifiable information (PII).  Current Receipts Conversion Services will process Standard FBI card formats including criminal fingerprint cards (FD-249) and civil fingerprint cards (FD-258).  These scanning services are currently performed at 500 pixels-per-inch (ppi) accuracy.  An option is anticipated to be included to allow processing at 1000 ppi at some point in the future.  The Contractor will be responsible for all necessary labor, equipment, computers, scanners, printers, storage devices, supplies, consumable materials, and facilities to accomplish the conversion and transmission tasks.  Processing requirements are anticipated to vary from 1000 to 5000 cards per day with an anticipated average of 3000 cards per day during the first fiscal year of the contract.  Contractor staff working at the FBI facility in Fairmont, WV, will receive fingerprint cards from the FBI, catalog and stage the cards for shipping, securely transport the cards to the Contractor’s facility, process the cards at the Contractor’s facility, and then return hard copy cards to the FBI for completion of a quality assurance review.  To support the conversion process, the Contractor’s facility should be within easy (i.e., affordable) transport range of Fairmont, WV.
                   
Miscellaneous Conversion Services

There may be various formats of palmprint submissions, including but not limited to the standard 
FD 884/884a palmprint card, which will need converted and included as part of the electronic messages.  
Since daily processing requirements are unknown at this time, the FBI will require a cost breakdown of 
price per card based on daily processing increments, for example, “0 – 50 cards”, “51 – 100 cards” and 
so forth (with a threshold of no more than 300 palmprint cards per day).

There may be various sizes of photographs which will need converted and included as part of the electronic messages.   Since daily processing requirements are unknown at this time, the FBI will require a cost breakdown of price per card based on daily processing of “0 – 50”, “51 – 100” and so forth (with a threshold of no more than 300 photographs per day).  These photographs will include facial photographs as well as photographs of scars, marks and/or tattoos.

The FBI will also be accepting Foreign National fingerprint cards for conversion into electronic messages.
The majority of these fingerprint cards will be in non-standard format.  Throughput requirements for Foreign National fingerprint cards are estimated to be 500 fingerprint cards per day.

Normally, cards received one day should be processed and ready for transmission to the FBI within 72 hours.  An option is anticipated to be included to allow processing at 1000 ppi at some point in the future.  The Contractor will be responsible for all necessary labor, equipment, computers, scanners, printers, storage devices, supplies, consumable materials, and facilities to accomplish the conversion and transmission tasks.  The Contractor will produce and transmit to the FBI digitized electronic records in EBTS format for all miscellaneous conversion services.  Contractor staff working at the FBI facility in Fairmont, WV, will receive the fingerprint cards from the FBI, catalog and stage the cards for shipping, securely transport the cards to the Contractor’s facility, process the cards at the Contractor’s facility, and then return hard copy cards to the FBI for completion of a quality assurance review.  To support the conversion process, the Contractor’s facility should be within easy (i.e., affordable) transport range of Fairmont, WV.

Archive Conversion Services

Approximately 35 million archive items, including standard and non-standard fingerprint cards, are required 
to be converted within five years of the start of the contract.  The majority of these cards will be in civil non-standard card format.  The Contractor will produce and transmit to the FBI digitized electronic records in EBTS format.  For the duration of the contract period of performance, the Contractor may be required to provide electronic storage of the processed cards for on-call retrieval by the FBI as processing capacity allows.  These scanning services were previously performed at 500 ppi.  The Contractor will be responsible for all necessary labor, equipment, computers, scanners, printers, storage devices, supplies, consumable materials, and facilities to accomplish the conversion and transmission tasks.  As part of this task, cleared Contractor staff working at the FBI facility in Fairmont, WV, will remove the fingerprint cards from the FBI files, catalog and stage the cards for shipping, securely transport the cards to the Contractor’s facility, process the cards at the Contractor’s facility, and then return hard copy cards to the FBI for completion of a quality assurance review. To support the conversion process, the Contractor’s facility should be within easy (i.e., affordable) transport range of Fairmont, WV.


Information requested from industry includes the capability to perform either or all of the services described above and recommended contract strategies to accomplish these efforts.  Please include descriptions of both current capabilities and capabilities available following limited systems development funded by the FBI.  Please recognize the immediate need to process Current Receipts Conversion Services.  (NOTE:  a lengthy development period to establish Current Receipts Conversion Services will not be practical).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses. The U.S. Department of Food & Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to apply WebVDME (web-based Visual Data Mining Environment), a data mining tool developed under a (Food and Drug Administration) FDA Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lincoln Technologies, Inc. to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). WebVDME supports the detection and quantification of safety signals in post-marketing data. The software utilizes advanced data mining techniques, including: Multi-Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Logistic Regression. WebVDME is currently being used to detect signals of adverse events in the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database and has been applied to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data.  It is also being piloted at the FDA to analyze medical device adverse events reported into the MAUDE database. The contractor shall customize the software, data preparation and provide refreshing processes, training, and consulting support. An important component of this project is cleaning and preparing the MAUDE data which will provide FDA with an improved capability to extract actionable intelligence from its data. Device information from safety reports is captured in the MAUDE database as a verbatim representation of the original text in the report. As a result, the same device may be referred to by many different names, for example with or without the manufacturer name, type number or other specifics, as well as a variety of possible misspellings.  In order to be able to consistently identify a specific device or device class for data mining purposes, this data will need to be cleaned up.  The proposed approach for cleaning up the MAUDE data is based on proven techniques that are currently being applied on a monthly basis to internally released data from the AERS database, and which include mapping-based automatic spelling correction, synonym mapping and other data transformations. After such an approach has been developed and implemented, it can be re-applied on a regular basis with ever-increasing efficiency due to the gradual increase in size of mapping and synonym tables, covering an ever greater proportion of possible misspellings and synonyms. Once the cleanup has been completed it will be possible to apply quantitative signal detection against the cleaned MAUDE database at various aggregation levels dependent on the desired granularity of the result. During the data mining pilot the MAUDE database has been found to contain a significant number of duplicate reports which could negatively influence the reliability of the data mining results.  Therefore the cleaning process will also include identification of duplicate reports in order to be able to exclude such reports from data mining. The contractor shall provide the following tasks: The Contractor shall assist FDA in developing and operating an advanced safety data mining application for use with the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database which represents reports of adverse events involving medical devices. 1)  In consultation with FDA staff, develop data cleaning procedures as necessary to prepare MAUDE for use in data mining, addressing issues such as manufacturer and device brand name normalization, use of hierarchical classification information to support data aggregation at multiple levels, and detection of duplicate reports. The work for coronary stents and oxygenators has been completed. The project will be extended to up to 15 device categories.  The following device types will be included: a) Glucose meters and glucose test strips b) Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers (including leads and generators) c) Fluoroscopes and related accessories d) Intraocular lenses e) Electro-surgical units and accessories Furthermore, manufacturer name normalization will be extended for all device types. 2) MAUDE data for coronary stents and oxygenators has previously been prepared for use in data mining.  This data will be refreshed monthly.3) MAUDE data for infusion pumps has been previously prepared for use in data mining.  The contractor shall address issues such as device brand name normalization, use of hierarchical classification information to support data aggregation at multiple levels, and detection of duplicate reports.  This data will be refreshed monthly. 4) Make up to four snapshots of the MAUDE data available over the course of year 1 for use with WebVDME, including transforming the MAUDE data to conform to the WebVDME data model, creating the WebVDME configuration (metadata) needed for Query and Reporting, and identifying MAUDE data cleaning needs. 5) The contractor shall work with FDA staff to explore alternative data mining techniques (including PRR, MGPS, and logistic regression) to determine which approaches are most productive for use in the generation of safety signals on MAUDE data. 6) Collaborate with FDA staff in the initial investigation of safety issues of interest, including for example safety issues related to ICD lead fractures. 7) Provide updates of the WebVDME software as required. 8) Support an initial cadre of FDA users (up to 20 users) by providing: system administration, training and assistance in the use of the system through telephone support, and up to 4 visits or WebEx remote sessions for support and training. 9) The contractor shall work with FDA OIT/SS staff to set up an FDA-provided dedicated computer server for production use with WebVDME, including installation and configuration of foundation software such as operating system, Oracle database, backup utilities, etc. 10) Install WebVDME safety data mining software on the server. 11) Develop a validated production process for the automated periodic refreshing and cleaning of the MAUDE data and place this process into routine operation (e.g., once a month). 12) Work with OIT/SS staff to prepare the necessary documentation, review and approval steps prior to production rollout. 13) Roll the system out to the full community of MAUDE users, including development and delivery of CDRH-specific on-site training at FDA. 14) Provide regular (e.g., first 6 months quarterly, then monthly) refreshes of the MAUDE data. 15) Provide project management resources to coordinate the above activities. The contractor must have experience in data mining software and the MAUDE adverse event reporting system. This includes prior experience in the development of webVDME and cleaning of MAUDE data to prepare for data mining. The contractor must have experience in the development and use of Bayesian data mining algorithms, including Multi-Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). The NAICS Code is 541511.  The small business size standard is 23M. Interested small business must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government requirement that is stated above. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient to evaluate your capability statement effectively. Information submitted must be in sufficient detail to permit the government to determine whether your organization meets the government requirement. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Quotation.  This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a purchase order or contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses that may provide operation and maintenance for FDA’s WebDME software, to expand the use of WebVDME throughout FDA division and to develop a signal annotation feature that allows users to differentiate signals that are already labeled or disease related. The U.S. Department of Food & Drug Administration (FDA) explored the utility of data mining for pharmacovigilance, and entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Lincoln Technologies, Inc. The purpose of this CRADA, was to develop a web-based data mining software tool.  The WebVDME has been use by safety evaluators, epidemiologists, and medical officers since 2005.   FDA has an interest in maintenance and operations of its current instances of WebVDME and further development and piloting of statistical data mining techniques/tools and to include techniques/tools based on WebVDME that are capable of generating—in an automated, reproducible and systematic way—a set of important and useful safety signals in a graphical illustration of the data that can serve as valuable input to the overall process of drug safety monitoring and review.  Safety Signals are individual drug-event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion.  These signals need to be carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently owns an Axiovert 200 and a Discovery V20 microscope, both manufactured by Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc. and controlled by Zeiss Axiovision software.  

NIST is researching two (2) new automated inverted microscopes and additional accessories to 
improve the automation, sensitivity and software control of the existing Carl Zeiss microscope 
system, thereby improving existent measurement capability.  

The two new microscopes must be capable of making sensitive long-term measurements of viable cells within NIST’s microfludic systems.  All of these microscope systems must be capable of complete software and hardware inter-operability so as to provide continuity between competed research experiments and the experiments to be performed with the new systems.
		
NIST is seeking vendors, other than Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., who can manufacture and deliver two new automated inverted microscopes and additional accessories that can meet all of the following requirements.  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If 2 or more small businesses are determined to be capable of meeting the requirements set forth herein, NIST will conduct the complete procurement as a small business set-aside.

Existent Zeiss microscopy systems refer to the Axiovert 200 and the Discover V20, controlled by Zeiss Axiovision software. 

(1) Provide instrument hardware that is compatible with and can utilize Carl Zeiss parts and accessories;

(2) Provide new parts and accessories that will be backward compatible with NIST’s existent Zeiss microscopy systems and automation software; 

 (3) Provide software that will provide full control over existent microscope parts and attachments; 

 (4) Provide software that will allow users of the new microscopes to be able to open and process existent data, hardware configuration, and instrument setting files.  Full software and file compatibility is essential to ensure continuity between the data collected over the past 2 years with data collected on the new microscope systems;

(5) Fully provide a microscopy system that meets all of NIST’s operational needs without requiring additional components from third parties.  This reduces the likelihood of incompatibilities between microscope systems and ensures that there will be a single responsible party to remedy the situation if (when) incompatibilities arise. 

Vendors must provide detailed information on their ability, experience and expertise to satisfy the above requirements.  In addition, any other information considered pertinent to the requirements must be submitted to Carol A. Wood, Contract Specialist, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.   

Information submitted must be specific and address each of the above points. 

Submissions must be received by 3:00 p.m. local time on August 21, 2008.  Original and e-mail submissions are acceptable.

Vendors shall identify their business size as Small Business in accordance with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334516; the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The US Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Office of Aviation (INL/A) is seeking sources of supply who can provide the following:

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR U.S. EMBASSY AFGHANISTAN AIRLIFT

General:  Since the winter of 2001 United States forces have been engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan against terrorist forces.  Travel within that country is extremely hazardous due to the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and ambush tactics of the anti-coalition forces.  As a result the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul identified a requirement to provide airlift for government personnel who need to travel to various locations throughout Afghanistan in order to conduct official business.  This will require approximately 35,000 individual personnel movements annually to more than 40 locations, some of which do not have runways/airstrips.  

Scope:  The Department of State needs a capability to provide secure, safe air transportation in support of Embassy programs in order to accomplish its mission in Afghanistan.  To accomplish the mission, a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft, light-lift helicopters and medium/heavy-lift helicopters will be required.  The aircraft will perform their missions predominately during the hours of daylight and at times during the hours of darkness (to include NVG) under both visual meteorological conditions and instrument meteorological conditions.  .  

	The concept of operations envisions the fixed-wing aircraft based at the Kabul International Airport (IAP) and the light and medium/heavy-lift helicopter fleet based at both Kabul and Kandahar airports. 

Fixed Wing Airlift Mission:   Personnel would be transported from Kabul IAP where they would board the fixed-wing aircraft for airlift to Kandahar or other suitable/designated airfield and transfer to helicopter for movement to a field site or if a suitable airfield they would travel via the fixed-wing aircraft to that airfield.   To perform this mission the Department of State will require twin engine turboprop type aircraft with a range with internal/auxiliary fuel of 1,800 to 2,000 nautical miles, cargo load of 3,000 pounds and passenger capacity of greater than 15 passengers (with equipment), a pressurized cabin or oxygen-generating system for operations above 10,000 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL), capable of taking off and landing on unpaved runways, equipped with a standard Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), day/night avionics and instrument package; equipped with limited passive defensive armor and aircraft survivability equipment, such as an integrated AAR-47/ALE-47 missile launch warning and counter-measures system, and NVG compatible cockpits.

Capable sources of supply may send a synopsis of recommended aircraft solutions, rough order of magnitude pricing, availability of airframes, and any other pertinent information.

A)	BACKGROUND

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.    Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on energy market and resources development, the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139*** million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (OEG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE).  Under the 2008 Operational Plan, the Office of Economic Growth (OEG) is responsible for the management of a large portfolio which comprises six areas (Infrastructure, Macroeconomic Foundation for Growth, Trade and Investment, financial Sector, Agriculture and Private Sector Competitiveness).

B)	DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Energy policy, market expansion, and resource development is the primary foreign policy/development nexus in Central Asia with USAID/CAR’s energy activities receiving the highest attention within the USG and being vital to the Agency.  This nexus, combined with the high visibility, often leads to sensitive situations in which broad policy statements and basic legislation needs to be interpreted and acted upon in a way which demonstrates sound judgement and creativity.  Under the general guidance of the Director of the Office of Economic Growth (OEG), the Senior Energy Policy Specialist (SEPS) will demonstrate, through the following duties and responsibilities, that he/she is a recognized authority in Central Asia and throughout the broader region.       

Technical leadership (40%):	

This challenging position requires intensive technical and administrative attention to resolve ongoing political, technical and managerial challenges for the delivery of critical development benefits to CAR and the broader region.  The SEPS will be in the forefront of knowledge on political and energy conditions in each of the five Central Asian countries to provide overall conceptual guidance and inform program management decisions by US Embassies and USAID.  The SEPS will also be the Mission’s point person for coordinating energy activities with USAID’s Missions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.   Identify issues that may be of concern to USAID senior staff, and recommend strategies for response.  Serve as a key resource to mission management for energy analysis across the mission’s relevant portfolios; water, natural resource management, and local economic development.  

Serve as a core member of the Office of Economic Growth, and principal expert advisor on a range of energy issues (legal and regulatory framework, generation addition/investment promotion, engineering/feasibility, power purchase agreements, transmission planning…), along with sectoral policy developments.  Incumbent should be well versed in energy research and program implications as they apply to issues in Central Asia, and current in the literature, e.g., documents from the IMF, World Bank, EBRD, and other published/unpublished sources throughout the Central Asia Republics (CAR) region.  Under the supervision of the OEG Director and at the request of Senior Mission Staff, provide independent analysis of political and energy developments affecting USAID programs across the region and act as the authority for interpreting and developing guidelines.   Evaluate and provide recommendations on all energy issues in the CAR to include ensuring access of the Mission to best practices and relevant energy expertise, and using these to develop and advise on state of the art energy policies and programs.  Guide the development, design, management, implementation and monitoring of energy policy reform projects and activities throughout the region.  The primary policy area for the Specialist will be electricity market development and integration to include energy (primarily electrical) sector reforms, promotion of large new investments, inter- and intra-regional trade, regional water and energy cooperation, and the role of private sector and countries outside of CAR.  The Specialist will maintain current knowledge of country specific programs involving laws and regulations, tariffs, utility unbundling, restructuring, commercialization and privatization strategies, and energy efficiency programs, as well as assistance under bilateral and IFI programs, including national governments’ policy framework and drivers.  Coordination and joint programming with the USAID/Afghan/Pakistan missions and with the ANE Bureau South Asian Energy Initiative (SARI) to ensure broader energy market development is crucial. 

The Specialist will lead discussions, negotiations, and other contacts at senior policy and technical levels of the U.S. Embassies in Central Asia and other US Government entities, to develop and implement the U.S. Mission’s energy policy reform strategy.  Prepare and conduct regular and special briefings to Mission and Europe & Eurasia (E&E) Bureau leadership, the State Department, Commerce, Treasury, National Security Council and to other high level officials of the USG, including Congressional staff.

Meet regularly with senior officials of the five governments of the region as well as leaders of the private sector to promote the programs and overcome problems and difficulties that arise in the planning and implementation of program activities.  Defend, justify, and promote, as appropriate, USAID’s position, and negotiate amicable resolution of issues to the benefit of the program’s major objectives. Contribute to strengthen the CAR energy reform through sustainable institutional capacity development.

Identify and develop linkages with other donor programs, particularly the ADB, World Bank, EBRD, International Monetary Fund, and EU-TACIS.  Lead and coordinate the work of USAID’s contractors, technical assistance advisors, and grantees to assure that activities are consistent with USAID’s energy/economic policy strategies. 

Strategy Development and Program Design (20%):

The SEPS will play a leading role in designing assistance programs to achieve the Economic Growth objectives of the CAR Operational Plan, particularly those which support improved energy policies.  Monitor, analyze, and report on political and economic conditions in each of the five Central Asian countries to assess assistance needs and priorities.  Conceptualize and design projects and program activities that achieve identified priorities and objectives.  Evaluate the costs, benefits and effectiveness of proposed projects.  Conduct or lead data gathering, research and analysis, and dialogue with counterparts necessary to inform program design decisions.  Lead or be a key member of technical selection committees for the award of procurement instruments.  Plan and design evaluation instruments as needed to make informed program design and management decisions.  As relevant, the SEPS will also conduct research and advise other sector teams to inform strategy and program design and management.  Work with other offices within the Mission to generate synergies and complementary activities.

Program Management and Mentorship (30%):

VistA is a mission critical component in providing quality health care to veterans.  VistA operating system is OpenVMS and the hardware platform is based on the Alpha CPU.  This is the hardware platform that is in place at VA facilities around the country.   In order to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic event disabling a facility for an extended period of time, VA has a system termed as "Recoverall."  This Recoverall system is shipped to an ailing facility usually within 24 hours should a catastrophic event, such as the flooding from a pipe-burst in Nashville, significantly damage the VistA configuration. The Recoverall system, in its entirety, was shipped to Nashville in order to return that facility to full operational capacity.  VA must now replace, or "replenish" this equipment so that that the Recoverall system hardware may be available for another catastrophic event.  Because the systems must be exact replacements for field facility items, no other equipment will satisfy VA's needs.  Responses to this notice must be in writing and must be received by 4:00 pm CST on August 19, 2008. Interested firms will be considered only if responding with clear and convincing evidence that they are able to provide HP Alpha Servers on the NASA SEWP IV contract, with full 3 year warranties as provided by the SEWP IV contract. No additional synopsis information will be published, and a solicitation will only be issued on SEWP IV. Responses should be emailed to jeff.bishop@va.gov.

<DESC>This is an announcement of an US HHS/FDA Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Management (OEEODM) streamlined competition. FDA is conducting a streamlined competition in accordance with OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. 

The competition will include those services that are currently performed in Rockville, MD.  Services being competed include equal employment opportunity and diversity management activities. Typical functions to be performed include counseling, dispute/conflict resolution, accommodation support, training, document development, budge support, drafting policy, office automation, litigation support, diversity management and special projects. Approximately 26 Full Time Equivalent positions are affected by this competition.  

The Competitive Sourcing Official designee for FDA is Joe Ellis. Georgia Coffey is the Agency Tender Official. The FDA Contracting Officer is Patricia Pemberton, patricia.pemberton@fda.hhs.gov. 

This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. Prospective offerors are advised that a solicitation will not be issued if the cost of contract performance is determined to be greater than the cost of in-house performance by Government personnel. No solicitation exists at this time. The solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities if and when it is released. The projected end date is on or before December 17, 2008.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO SOLICITATION SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED, AND PROPOSALS ARE THEREFORE NOT REQUESTED

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, intends to modify the current Information Technology/Information Services (IT/IS) contract HM1571-07-C-0004, to include additional work to perform migration services and acquire the requisite hardware, software and associated materials and supplies necessary to accomplish NGA’s System Transition Project (STP) effort. 

Total modification value is approximately $75,000,000. The contractor is NJVC LLC, 8614 Westwood Center Drive, Vienna, VA  22182-2233. NJVC is the current provider of IT/IS support to NGA.  The IT/IS contract provides a full range of information technology and information services operations and sustainment (O&S) to intelligence systems for NGA.  NGA is currently identifying existing systems/entities, determining their future state and implementing those Agency decisions in preparation for the congressionally mandated Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) move.  The STP effort requires migration to be completed by February 2010.  The total systems under IT/IS purview is approximately eighty-eight.  This is an extremely aggressive schedule and a significant subset of the systems/entities identified fall under the IT/IS operations and sustainment purview.  Given the IT/IS original equipment manufacturer expertise, schedule constraints, complexity and age of the systems involved, the mission dependency across systems and the overall magnitude of the effort, the need to have the IT/IS contractor authorized and responsible for material purchases associated with their respective STP initiatives is of key importance and will significantly reduce program execution risk to the Agency and enable NGA to meet the Congressionally directed BRAC date.  

A significant number of the STP systems are old and complex and fall within the legacy/heritage group that NJVC currently maintains.  These are mission critical systems that have experienced numerous performance modifications without updates to the configuration management.  Complete functional definitions and system design of the STP entities and their interfaces with enterprise networks are not available. In turn, this has made precise material articulation and integration of systems problematic.  Complete engineering assessments will be necessary.   


This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper and past performance data no late than 22 August 2008, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Mail Stop P-093, Attn: Jonathan Mostowski, 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816-5003. Responses received by 22 August 2008 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. All contractors who provide good/services to the DoD must be registered in the Central Contractor register (CCR.) Online Certifications and Representations at (ORCA), http://orce.bpn.gov, will also be required. Failure to comply with ORCA registration may make a vendor offeror ineligible for award. The point of contact for this Notice is Contracting Officer Jonathan Mostowski, jonathan.b.mostowski@nga.mil. No telephone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is offering contracts to obtain serum samples for a national repository. This specific requirement is to obtain specimens from physician-diagnosed fibromyalgia patients who have not had Lyme disease. These samples and supporting clinical information will be used for the study of Lyme disease. This is being advertised to determine what organizations may be willing and able to offer to obtain one or more types of serum samples that are needed for this serum bank. The bank will eventually contain positive and negative control samples, as well as serum from patients with illnesses within the differential diagnosis of Lyme disease or with conditions that elicit antibodies that may cross-react in laboratory tests. Please review the included Statement of Work (SOW) below. If you feel you can accomplish this requirement, please submit a brief proposal that addresses each item in the statement of work, plus a separate cost proposal, no later than close of business August 29, 2008.  Since the end of the federal fiscal year is fast approaching, your prompt response is appreciated. We anticipate that this contract will be awarded in FY08. Statement of Work is as follows: Background: Serologic assays are the mainstay of laboratory testing for assessing exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis.  CDC, NIH, and FDA currently recommend that serology be performed using a two-tiered algorithm.  (This method consists of an enzyme immunoassay or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay as a first-tier test, followed by Western immunoblotting of samples that produce positive or indeterminate first-tier results.)   Two-tiered testing performs well for determination of IgG antibodies after the first several weeks of infection, but works less well for determination of IgM responses. It would be desirable to improve serology in several ways:  to increase the sensitivity of testing in early disease, to improve the specificity of IgM testing (or to make it unnecessary), and to develop alternatives to the two-tiered approach that are simpler, more objective, and less costly.  Clinical decisions about the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis could be better supported by improved serologic tests.  A great impediment to these efforts is the lack of an adequate bank of serum samples from clinically well-characterized Lyme borreliosis patients and controls that can be used by the research community. The statutory authority permitting this procurement is 40 U.S.C. 759(g), as amended, and/or 41 U.S.C. *253-(c)(I).  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain specimens and supporting clinical information to establish a standardized national repository of control serum samples for the study of Lyme borreliosis.  This repository and clinical information database will be maintained by staff at the Division of Vector-borne Infectious Diseases, CDC.  Eventually this serum bank should have samples from patients with diverse manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, from healthy donors, and from patients with other illnesses (either within the differential diagnosis of Lyme disease or known to elicit cross-reacting antibodies) for use in evaluating improved serologic tests. CDC will benefit from this procurement by being better able to serve its constituents by providing positive and negative control serum samples and anonymous clinical information to qualified investigators.  It will also have resources to better perform in-house work to improve serology for Lyme disease. The scope of work for this requirement is as follows: Vendor shall obtain and deliver to CDC serum samples of  approximately 15 mL each from 20 individuals with physician-diagnosed fibromyalgia and who have not had Lyme disease. Vendor shall obtain and deliver to CDC clinical and laboratory information (that excludes other diagnoses) to support the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.  The vendor will secure institutional and CDC Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval prior to collection of serum samples for this procurement and will obtain informed consent from each serum donor. Serum specimens will be coded by a unique number; direct personal identifiers will not be shared with CDC. CDC will work with selected vendor to obtain CDC IRB approval for serum sample collections and will receive deliverables, as specified. The vendor shall perform the following tasks and complete them within two years of the award of this contract: Task I:  Write a protocol and obtain institutional IRB approval for this serum acquisition.  The protocol should include the case definition used for fibromyalgia.  Coordinate efforts to obtain institutional IRB approval with the CDC project officer to facilitate CDC IRB approval of this protocol.  Obtain CDC IRB approval before beginning serum acquisition. Task II:  Obtain negative control reference serum samples from 20 separate individuals with fibromyalgia.  Each sample should be at minimum the serum resulting from the collection of three 10-mL vials of whole blood; that is, approximately 15 mL per patient, but up to 25 mL is desirable. Task III:  Develop and summarize clinical and laboratory information (that excludes other diagnoses) to support the diagnosis of fibromyalgia for each patient. Task IV:   Store serum samples in 5 mL screw cap cryotubes at -70 degrees C. and ship them to CDC on dry ice.  If a -70 degree freezer is not available, samples may be stored for up to two weeks at -20 degrees C. The period of performance for this procurement shall be for two years from the date of award in fiscal year 2008. The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the project officer on or before date indicated, or within two years from date of award. (1)  Written record of IRB approval of the protocol that includes the case definition used (March 1, 2009). (2)  Serum samples and supporting clinical and laboratory data as specified above (within two years from date of award).  Serum samples received at CDC (DVBID, Fort Collins, CO) in good condition with no gross evidence of hemolysis, repeated freeze-thawing, or microbial contamination and accompanied by a document with data supporting the diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be accepted for inclusion in the serum specimen bank. Forty percent of the contract amount will be paid after the protocol has been developed and IRB approvals have been obtained from both the vendor institution and CDC. Sixty percent of the contract amount will be paid after delivery of 20 samples from 20 patients when accompanied by supporting written documentation of fibromyalgia.  Partial payments will be paid upon invoice at the rate of 3.0% of the contract amount for each qualifying serum sample.   Delivery of samples in batches is preferred so that no more than 2-3 invoices are received per year. Minimum vendor qualifications for this project are as follows: (1) physician (MD or equivalent) project leader; (2) access to a suitable patient population; (3) experience in the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia, preferably demonstrated by publications in the peer-reviewed scientific literature; (4) previous experience obtaining IRB approval of a protocol that involved acquisition of clinical specimens and possession of an institutional FWA number desirable. No other solicitation is being issued. Reminder: your cost proposal should be sent as separate documentation. Do not include any pricing reference in your technical proposal. If you intend to propose, please contact me via e-mail with the subject line “Fibromyalgia Panel” by close of business August 22, 2008. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for the rehabilitation of sewer lines at the Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base, Klamath Falls, Oregon using trenchless technology and is prepared in accordance with format Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Award of this acquisition is based on the governments availability of funds. The solicitation number for this project is KJAQ042961 and is a request for proposal. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 237110.  This project is not set aside and is open to large and small business concerns. The DPAS rating for this acquisition is DC-02.<BR><BR>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The United States Property and Fiscal Office for Oregon is soliciting a proposal for the rehabilitation of 4,700 (2200 LF of 10 pipe and 2500 LF of 8 pipe) of the existing sanitary sewer system at Kingsley Field, Oregon using Trenchless Cured in Place Pipe techniques. The Contractor will provide all labor, tools, equipment, and materials to complete this project in accordance with all Federal, State, county, and local regulations and codes. Contractor will protect all facilities, grounds, equipment, and utilities not scheduled to receive work. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that  all safety, OSHA, DEQ, and EPA rules and regulations are observed. Coordination with the Civil Engineering office and the building users ten (10) days prior to start of work is required. The new materials shall be warranted in writing against defects for a period of one year. The installation will be warranted for one year against any failure. The Contractor will be allowed to work on the base SDO (scheduled day off) Mondays with approval of Civil Engineering<BR><BR>CLIN 0001 - Phase 1  Data Collection and Existing System Condition Determination<BR><BR>CLIN 0001A -  Data Collection. The Contractor will compile and review available information regarding the existing sanitary sewer as needed. Existing maps, construction drawings, as-built drawings, and studies will be collected and reviewed. Both hard copies and electronic copies of the existing infrastructure mapping will be reviewed. Existing videos and video logs of the sanitary sewer system will be reviewed.  Video and video logs will be available for review prior to the proposal due date.<BR><BR>CLIN 0001B - Kickoff Meeting. The Contractor will arrange for a kickoff meeting to review project objectives, goals, schedule, and anticipated deliverables. This kickoff meeting will include personnel from ORANG, the Contractor, and potential subcontractors. Immediately following this meeting, a site visit will be conducted.<BR><BR>CLIN 0001C -  Underground Camera Inspection. The Contractor shall use appropriate video equipment to physically inspect the current conditions inside the portions of the main sanitary sewer system scheduled to be repaired. The video survey will be used to evaluate current conditions of the sewer pipe (e.g., structural characteristics, diameter and roundness, leaking and damaged joints, blockages, and location of lateral connections) to facilitate designing the liner to appropriate specifications. This process will require accessing the sewer lines via manholes, temporarily diverting/plugging sections of the sewer system, and directing a camera through the pipes to visually inspect the sewer runs.<BR><BR>CLIN 0001D -  Design and Specification of Liner System. The Contractor will use the results of the video survey and site visit to select and design the appropriate liner specifications, and the project materials needed to complete the project will be ordered. Specific pipe lining materials, thicknesses, run lengths, installation points, and temporary diversion or bypass sections will be determined.<BR><BR><BR>CLIN 0002 - Phase 2  Sewer Liner Installation (2200 LF of 10 pipe and 2500 LF of 8 pipe)<BR><BR>CLIN 0002A - Water Jet Blasting/Mechanical Pipe Cleaning. Prior to installation of liners, the main sewer pipe will be cleaned to remove any blockages or sediment that may interfere with proper installation of the pipe liner. Lateral lines connected to the sanitary sewer line will be temporarily plugged before the cleaning and in-situ repair activities. Temporary hose lines and pumps will be used to reroute sewage around segments of the main line undergoing repairs. Individuals with confined space training and applicable permits will enter sanitary sewer manholes to remove sediment from the laterals using a combination sewer hydrojetter-vacuum truck and mechanical in-pipe apparatus. The Contractor can assume that all sludge, sediment, wash water, and groundwater (i.e., clean-out waste) evacuated from the sanitary sewer will be discharged to the sanitary sewer system. It is anticipated that clean water and condensate generated during liner processing and installation will not be captured, but will also be discharged to the sanitary sewer system. The project is not expected to require any special waste handling provision and such provision is not included in this SOW. The Contractor will follow the sewer cleaning activities with video inspection to confirm effectiveness and assess damages.  The contractor will be responsible to repair any damage to the system as a result of cleaning activities.<BR><BR>CLIN 0002B- Structural Pipe Repair. Depending on the specific liner technology selected, some areas exhibiting excessive infiltration, settlement, or structural damage may require localized structural repairs. In such cases the structural spot repairs will be performed in-situ and then the pipe liner will be installed within the repaired sections in continuous lengths extending from manhole to manhole.  The contractor shall ensure that proper pipe slope is maintained with repairs.  No bellies in the pipe will be accepted.  In instances where the existing piping is completely collapsed or in a state of advanced structural decay, invasive trenching and pipe replacement may be needed. Such conditions will be determined on a case-by case basis.  <BR><BR>CLIN 0002C - Sewer Lining. The sewer liners will be installed using trenchless technology and following manufacturers recommendations. Although the installation procedure varies by manufacturer, in general, the pipe liner will be inserted into an entry manhole where it will be extended using pressurized water or air or pulled through the existing pipe using a tow cord inserted through the exit manhole. The pipe liner will then be expanded in place to conform to the existing pipe and then cured. The lateral sewer connections will be re-established using robotic technology. The completed liner will structurally reinforce the existing pipe and provide a continuous joint-free and low-friction surface in between manholes. <BR><BR>CLIN 0002D -  Lateral Re-establishment of Side Services. A remote controlled robotic device will be used to reinstate the laterals that were identified and accurately mapped during the video inspection.<BR><BR>CLIN 0002E-  Post Video Inspection. A post-lining video camera survey of the pipe will also be conducted to verify proper installation of lining and reopening of lateral connections. Any areas that are found not in compliance with manufacturers specifications will be removed and replaced.<BR><BR>CLIN 0003 - Phase 3  Draft and Final Reports<BR><BR>CLIN 0003A -  Prepare Draft & Final Report. Contractor will provide ORANG a Draft Report. This report will summarize the research, field activities, findings, and results of the repair measures performed. Contractor will provide a Final Report incorporating comments and revisions suggested by ORANG. The report will document the following topics:<BR><BR>a. Summary of the Existing System  This section will include a summary of existing<BR>information provided by ORANG regarding the sanitary sewer system.<BR><BR>b. Sewer Assessment  This section will describe the collection of the field data and<BR>discuss the initial existing condition of the sanitary sewer lines.<BR><BR>c. Liner Design  This section will describe the selected materials and specifications for the sewer pipe liners.<BR><BR>d. Sewer Lining  This section will discuss the installation of the sewer liners, reestablishment of lateral connections, and results of the confirmation video survey.<BR><BR>e. Site Plan  AutoCAD drawings depicting repaired areas will be prepared and included in the report.<BR><BR>PROPOSAL CONTENT: The following shall be contained in contractors proposal to be considered for award: Pricing for the above listed services.

<p>FOB Destination means free on board at destination; i.e., the seller or consignor delivers the goods on seller's or consignor's conveyance at destination. Unless the contract provides otherwise, the seller or consignor is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss. For use in the clause at FAR 52.247-34, see the definition at FAR 52.247-34(a).</p>
<p>(VIII) Desired delivery is within 240 days or less after award of purchase order; offeror shall state delivery within quote.</p>
<p>(IX) FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jun 2008), applies to this acquisition. In addition to written price quotes, offerors are instructed to provide descriptive literature, capability statement describing equipment specifications requirements listed in paragraphs (V), and 3 past performance references.</p>
<p>Past Performance References:<br />NIST requires at least three references to establish the previous delivery and successful operation of systems with similar capability to the one requested. The references will be asked the questions identified in Section VI - Sub paragraph 7 - Demonstration of prior delivery and successful operation of similar systems.</p>
<p>(X) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Award will be made to the Contractor whose proposal offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following evaluation criteria: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Technical Capability has a greater value than Past Performance. All non-price factors when combined are more important than price. If all things considered under Technical Capabilities combined with Past Performance are equal, Price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price will not be evaluated on proposals that are deemed technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Technical Capability - the proposal shall address all the requirements/specifications outlined above and shall provide indication of understanding and ability to meet requirements (See Section VI of this document).</p>
<p>Past Performance - Contractor shall include no fewer than 3 references, including address, phone number, and point-of-contact, from users who are currently operating the make and model of the proposed system in the field. Referenced models need not be of the current production year, but shall be production equipment manufactured within the past 24 months and designed for the same or similar purpose, and should be as functionally similar to the equipment being proposed.</p>
<p>Past Performance on contracts with the Federal Government, other public agencies, or private organizations may be considered. The past performance information submitted may be that of the Offeror's firm or its proposed subcontractors. Subcontractor past performance will only be considered if the past performance correlates to the work the contractor will be performing on the contemplated contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor should disclose any instances in which its Past Performance on a particular contract may be considered by others to be less than fully satisfactory by attaching a narrative. The Contractor should relate pertinent facts and circumstances and describe any remedial action taken or to be taken to correct the deficiency. Failure to disclose such instances may result in a determination that the Contractor has been less than candid with the Government, which could result in an unfavorable assessment of the Offeror's past performance record.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to limit the number of references it ultimately contacts and to contact references or use sources other than those provided by the Contractor to obtain information related to past performance. Other sources include, but are not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System; Federal, State or local governmental agencies; and private sector businesses. Limited exchanges between the Government and a Contractor may occur to clarify the relevance of a Contractor's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the Contractor has not previously had an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>Price shall reflect the total price. Contractor should ensure that their proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed.</p>
<p>(XI) The offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Jun 2008), with its quote.</p>
<p>(XII) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb 2007), applies to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  The National Park Service is seeking a contractor capable of providing all labor, supplies, materials and equipment for the manufacture of the specified items within this solicitation.  FOB: Destination for delivery to Shiloh National Military Park located in Shiloh, Hardin County, Tennessee:
(1) 24-pounder Siege & Garrison Artillery Carriage in aluminum with a solid ductile iron axle insert to mount a 24-pounder siege gun, solid aluminum wheels and authentic brass elevation screw painted with a two part epoxy industrial paint and finished with a 100% acrylic paint; 
(1a) Siege Limber constructed from high strength solid aluminum with solid ductile iron axle, steel axle strap and lashing chain, and steel sweep bar box. All aluminum parts etched and then primed; then, fork bridles, and under strap. All aluminum parts etched and then primed; then painted with a two part epoxy industrial paint and finished with a 100% acrylic paint.  The manufactured limber and carriage will be used to mount an original 24-pounder siege gun (Model 1819), weighing roughly 5,535 pounds, in "traveling mode," where the heavy trail attached to the limber in a manner necessary to counterbalance the weight of the limber pole. The gun is shifted rearward to the "traveling bed" where it is cradled behind its normal (in trunnion) firing position. This is accomplished by the so-called traveling trunnions (created by the enlarged bolts at the rear end of the cheeks to form an additional trunnion), and the cannon, when limbered, shifted rearward to these, the breech resting in the bolster. This operation necessitates removal of the elevating screw, which is reversed in its nut and permitted to hang beneath the carriage.  The metal display carriage and limber shall conform in all respects with specifications listed in the "Ordnance Manual for the Use of the Officers of The United States Army," Philadelphia, Pa., (1861), unless otherwise stated in the attached scope of work; 
(2) Two Metal display Navy 4-Truck cannon carriages, Length O/A: 73.25 inches, Height (excluding cap squares) 28.13 inches; made of ductile iron, ready to mount a 32-pounder Navy cannon; 
(3) Two 32-pounder chambered Navy cannon of 42 cwt.: Bore: diameter 6.4 inches, smoothbore, length 90.75; Length O/A 106.4 inches' Trunnion diameter 6.4 inches, length 5.5 inches; Normal weight 4,781 pounds; to match historic cannons originally cast at Fort Pitt and West Point Foundries in 1845.  The metal display carriage and cannon shall conform in all respects with specifications listed in The Ordnance Instructions for the United States Navy, 3 parts, Washington, D.C., (1864 and 1866); and in the Ordnance Manual For The Use Of The Officers of The United States Army, Philadelphia, Pa., (1861), unless otherwise stated in the attached scope of work:
(4) U.S. Model 1841 Number 1 Field Carriage.  The limber and ammunition chest shall conform in all respects with specifications listed in the 1861 Ordnance Manual for the use of the Officers of the United States Army, Chapter III, Artillery Carriages, unless otherwise stated in the attached Scope of Work:

Tree Planting Plan
James E and Ginger Fagan
Victoria County, Texas

Soils:  The predominant soils in the planting area are Aransas clay, frequently flooded, and Austwell Clay, frequently flooded.  These soils are a dark gray to black clay that is poorly drained and very slightly acidic to alkaline.  Surface runoff is slow and permeability is very slow.  The sticky nature of these soils will make planting difficult if moisture conditions are not almost ideal.

Tree Planting Specifications

"Pre-planning" Conference:  A pre-planting conference will be held between the contractor, owner (or agent) and the NRCS to discuss the planting operation.  Planting will not begin before this meeting.

Site Preparation:  The perennial vegetation within the treatment area include native and introduced grasses such as Common Bermuda grass and Gordo bluestem.  Forb and woody species such as Spiny Aster and Sump weed are also present.  Site preparation will include spray treatments utilizing approved systemic herbicides such as Roundup and Rodeo according to label directions on existing vegetation by September 15, 2008.  A second treatment may be required by October 22, 2008 in order to “cleanup” any vegetation that did not respond to the first spray treatment.  NRCS will determine the need for a second herbicide treatment, and will inform the contractor by 15 Oct 2008 if it is required.

Tree Planting:  Hardwood seedling will be hand or machine planted on a 12' x 12' spacing (303 trees per acre) on approximately 35 acres.  The planting area, except the strips around water impoundment, will consist of one mix described below.

Species:  Refer to the attached restoration plan map and species list below.  The tree planting contractor will be responsible for the ordering of the seedlings, their delivery to the site, their care, and, if necessary, cold storage.  The species for most of the site are grouped as preferred and secondary.  At least four species will be planted.  Each preferred species will make up no more than 30% of the total mix, and each secondary species will make up not more than 10% of the mix.  In addition, a separate mix will be used for the strips planted around water impoundments.  The species to be planted along with approximate percentages depending upon availability are listed below:

	Preferred Species:  Green ash 20%, Bur Oak 10%,  Willow Oak 10%,  Bald Cypress 20%, Cedar Elm 20%
	Secondary Species: Bitter Pecan 5%,  	Persimmon 5%, Hackberry 5%,  Mulberry 5%
                       Around Water Areas:  Bald Cypress, Bitter Pecan

The planting list is a guide to mixes that should be best suited for the site based on wetness, pH, etc.  Flexibility with the mixes is expected.  If substitution of species is necessary, those with equal or greater tolerance to the wetness will be chosen.  It is also expected that there will be sites within the planting area that may be too wet for species selected.  In these cases, wetness tolerant species should be used.

Species Substitutions:  If a substitution is necessary due to the unavailability of a species from the nursery, low counts in the bags, modifications of the planting plan due to unforeseen conditions, etc., a species will be selected that has an equal or greater tolerance to wetness than the originally selected one.  Any substitution must be approved by the NRCS beforehand.

Spacing and Planting Rate:  Hardwood seedlings will be planted on 12' x 12' spacing (303 seedlings per acre).  The number of satisfactorily planted seedlings must fall within 15% of this planting rate or 258 seedlings per acre.  Areas along the shores of impoundments and natural slough and wet depressions will be planted with species listed above to the extent that the water depth will allow.  In these areas, increase the spacing to 15' x 15'.  If a shortage of seedlings should occur due either to low seedling count or a high cull rate, the NRCS may either: (1) require the original purchaser (as stated above) to procure additional seedlings or (2) adjust the planting rate and/or acreage.  If, on the other hand, seedlings are planted closer than the above spacing, causing a shortage, the contractor will be responsible for additional seedlings needed to finish the planting.

Species Mixes:  Mixes will be achieved through "bag-mixes" and/or matching the species to the site.  Unless otherwise specified in the Tree Planting Plan, row or block plantings of single mixes will be avoided.  Further explanation will be provided at the pre-planting conference.

Planting Dates:  Unless otherwise specified, planting will be down between mid-December and late February.  

Seedling Quality:  Seedlings will meet the standards listed below for quality:

Minimum root collar diameter 		¼”
Minimum Height         			16”
Minimum root length  			8”
Minimum number of lateral roots		5
Condition           			Stiff and Woody

Together, the contractor and the NRCS technician will open at least one bag of each species being planted to determine quality and count.  The NRCS technician will discuss seedling quality with the contractor, and determine the need for modifying the planting plan or purchasing additional seedlings at this time.  It will be the responsibility of the contractor to "cull" seedlings according to the above or agreed to standards during planting.

Seedling Care:  It is the responsibility of the contractor to assure proper care of the seedlings during the planting operation.  Planting will begin immediately after receiving the seedlings.  Although cold storage (34oF to 40oF) is preferred, storage of seedlings in structures of shaded areas is permissible provided the planting will be completed within 7 days and the seedlings will be kept moist and cool (but not allowed to freeze).  Cold storage will be necessary if the planting will require more than 7 days after the receipt of the seedlings (but no longer than 3 weeks).  It will be the responsibility of the contractor to secure cold storage.  Only the number of seedlings that can be planted in a day will be taken to the site.  These will be kept shaded and moist. 

Pruning:

Roots:  The tap roots may be pruned to the minimum length of 8".  Lateral roots may be pruned to facilitate planting.  Prune by pulling the laterals down along the tap root and cut to its (the tap root's) length.  Prune only with shears or a sharp knife.  Do not tear roots.

Tops:  Tops may be pruned to the minimum height of 16".


Planting Methods:  Seedlings will be hand planted using either a dibble or planting shovel that can produce a 10" or deeper planting slit or by the use of a tree planter..  Seedlings will be planted with the root collar slightly below the soil surface. Roots will not be balled, twisted or planted in a "j" or "u" shaped manner.  Steps needed to ensure the compacting of the soil around the seedling, leaving no air pockets in the planting slit, will be taken.  Consult with the NRCS representative before planting when optimum site and soils moisture and/or temperature conditions are not available.

Quality Control
The contractor will be ultimately responsible for quality assurance.  Quality control will be explained during the pre-planting conference.  In addition, NRCS representatives will be available during the first day of planting and will occasionally visit the site during planting.  They will be available for consultation, but they will not serve as daily inspectors.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide day to day oversight of the planting crews.  NRCS will conduct an inspection at the completion of the planting to determine the acceptability of the planting.  The attached "Tree and Shrub Planting Compliance Record (Seedlings)" will be used for certification.

Specific requirements for materials, processes, performance, quality and installation are provided under the technical sections of these specifications. The Government reserves the right to inspect the Contractors work at any time, whether the work is performed in the field or at the Contractor's shop. All work in this contract shall be completed within 120 days of notice to proceed.<BR><BR>1.1  Overview of Work.<BR>The following information is offered as a general overview of the work required. The water supply gate and gate slot are protected from corrosion by use of sacrificial anodes. See drawings O. & M.M. Plate NO. C120 and C121. A total of four anodes are used, two on each side of the gate slot. Each anode is approximately eight (8) feet in length, not including the length of grounding wire needed to ground each end of each rod. The anodes run in the vertical direction of the gate slot from approximate elevation of 808.6 to 824.0 (See drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C120). The contractor shall remove existing anode attachment hardware and anodes and install new. Contractor shall provide and deliver to the government 8 new spare anode rods and miscellaneous hardware as outlined herein. The spares shall be delivered to the maintenance building at Smithville Lake.  An on-site inspection of the control tower, tower bridge, roadways, etc. by prospective bidders is STRONGLY recommended prior to submitting a bid.  The government will not allow fieldwork in this contract to start until the stoplogs for the water supply gate have undergone an inspection and possible repairs have been made and are available for service at the control tower. The stoplog work is being performed under a separate contract. Work in this contract will follow the stoplog inspection and should start in late September or October 2008. These start dates are not firm.<BR><BR>1.2  Water Supply Gate, Setting Stop Logs and Dewatering.<BR>The water supply gate is used to regulate raw water to the treatment plant for the City of Smithville, Missouri. In order for work to be performed in this contract, the supply of raw water to the City of Smithville through the conduit will be shut off. The government will coordinate the outage for the water supply gate with the City of Smithville. The procedure used by the government to dewater the control structure and the water supply line is to set stop logs and open the hatch (Access Cover, see drawing O & M.M. Plate NO. C136) in the water supply line (near end of conduit). This procedure takes approximately 24 hours for the tower and water line to become dewatered. Note: All leakage past the stop logs will enter the water supply line and be exiting the line at the hatch (Access Cover) and running onto the floor of the conduit. In recent times, the leakage past the stop logs has been estimated at about one (1) cubic feet per second (CFS). The government will set/remove all stop logs and secure the access cover for the supply line located near the end of the conduit.  The water supply gate is operated by the hydraulic system located within the control tower. The government will position the water supply gate as required for replacement of the anodes. In general, the gate will be in the full open position for replacement of the lower anodes and about two to four inches from the full closed position for replacement of the upper anodes. Due to the amount of leakage past the stop logs, it is recommended that the contractor place short sections of 2X4s or 4X4s under the bottom sealing edge of the gate and allow the gate to rest on the wood blocks when in the lowered position. This would allow any stop log leakage to pass underneath the gate during execution of the work. The government will have portable radios available for use by the contractor to help coordinate positioning of the gate.  Coordination and communication between the contractor and the government is of paramount importance for work in this contract. Every effort shall be made by the contractor and the government to minimize the time the conduit is offline. Work shall also be pursued by the contractor at a time when water demand is low. The government will notify the contractor when the intake structure and water line have been dewatered. The contractor shall be prepared to start work within 24 hours of notification that the conduit has been dewatered.<BR><BR>1.3  Work Schedule and Coordination. <BR>Following is the anticipated work schedule for work in this contract:<BR>A.	The government will notify the contractor one to two weeks prior to the outage required for shutdown of the raw water supply line. <BR>B.	The government will set stop logs and open the water line access cover in the conduit on a Monday morning. Dewatering will take about 24 hours.<BR>C.	The contractor will be given a 12 hour window to start and complete all work within the intake structure relative to removal and installation of anodes. The 12 hour window will fall between the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. on the day the work is accomplished.<BR>D.	Depending on site conditions, the contractor should anticipate accomplishing all work on either a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of the week scheduled for the outage. The exact day will be coordinated between the government and the contractor.<BR>E.	The government will pull stop logs and water up the supply line no later than Friday, 2:00 P.M. of the outage week scheduled.   <BR><BR>The government will schedule the outage during a low water demand period based on information provided by the City of Smithville. In general, the low water demand periods are spring and fall seasonal periods. The government will give the contractor as much advance notice as possible concerning the outage in order to minimize the impacts to the City of Smithville and maximize the work activities of the contractor.<BR><BR>1.4	Anode Replacement and Hardware.<BR>A total of four anodes are used, two on each side of the gate slot. Each anode is approximately eight (8) feet in length, not including the length of grounding wire needed to ground each end of each rod. NOTE: Extra length of anode is needed for each end of each segment to provide for grounding. ALL ROD ANODE SEGMENTS SHALL BE GROUNDED AT EACH (BOTH) END. The anodes run in the vertical direction of the gate slot from approximate elevation of 808.6 to 824.0 (See drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C120). The contractor shall remove existing anode attachment hardware and anodes and install new. Contractor shall provide and deliver to the government 8 new spare anode rods and miscellaneous hardware as outlined herein. The spares shall be delivered to the maintenance building at Smithville Lake.  The contractor shall fabricate 16 anode clamp straps. The clamp straps are the 12 gauge X 1 inch wide (length to suit anode clamp assembly, (see O. & M.M. Plate NO. C120, ANODE DETAIL A) stainless steel pieces that wrap around and hold the anode in place. The ends of the clamp straps are bent around the nuts to lock the nuts in place. It is assumed that some of the existing clamp straps may be missing or broken. Any of the new clamp straps not used for this work will be spares and become the property of the government.  The contractor shall fabricate 32 new rubber (50-80 durometer) isolators that wrap around the anode and isolate the anode from the anode clamp assembly (see O. & M.M. Plate NO. C120, ANODE DETAIL A). The rubber isolators are 1/8 inch thick, 1  inch wide and approximately 4.13 inch in length (4.13 inch length gives one complete wrap around the anode rod and the ends would butt together). It is assumed all of the existing rubber isolators are missing. Any new rubber isolators not used will be spares and become the property of the government.  The contractor shall provide 64 new stainless steel 3/8 inch course thread nuts for assembling the clamp strap to the anode clamp assembly.  Any unused nuts will be spares and become the property of the government.  The contractor shall provide 16 new stainless steel 3/8 inch course thread X 1-1/2 inch long stainless steel studs (Mark number 279). Should any of the existing studs be missing or broken, the contractor shall replace with new. Any unused studs will be spares and become the property of the government. The contractor is responsible for removal of any broken studs. Removal may require drilling and use of an extraction tool followed by chasing of the threads.<BR><BR>1.5	Magnesium Anodes.<BR>Anodes provided by contractor shall be Galvorod, DC-980 (1.315 inch nominal diameter) as supplied by Mesa Products (www.mesaproducts.com), Tulsa, Oklahoma (Telephone: 918-627-3188), or approved equal. Chemical composition of anode material shall be as supplied by Mesa Products or per ASTM B843, alloy H1A or H1B or H1C.  The length of the magnesium anode material for each rod shall be approximately 8 feet in length (+0 inch, - 3 inch) and shall have an 8 inch (-0 inch, +1 inch) length of core grounding wire protruding from each end of each rod.  The exact space for installation of the anodes is not known. Therefore, the contractor may have to remove additional magnesium anode material from the end(s) of the anodes in order to make them fit in the anode clamp assemblies within the gate slot. Whatever alterations are required on the anodes that are installed in the gate slot shall also be performed by the contractor on the spare anodes left with the Corps of Engineers. <BR><BR>1.6	Portable Crane.<BR>The contractor may wish to use a portable crane (boom truck) for work in this contract. If a portable crane is used by the contractor for hoisting personnel into and out of the work space, a crane meeting OSHA requirements shall be provided by the contractor. <BR><BR>1.6.1	OSHA Web Site Information.<BR>Information was obtained from the OSHA web site to inform the contractor of the capabilities required by the crane should a portable crane be used at the work site for hoisting personnel into and out of the work space.  This data may be obtained by contacting Cindy Clark at 816-389-3009 or cynthia.a.clark@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>1.7	Access to Work Area.<BR>Access to the work area by the contractor can be accomplished by either entering the access cover (hatch) in the water supply line near the end of the conduit or by being lowered through the opening for the grating for the water supply gate located at elevation 869.25 (lower tower work deck, noted as Trash Fender Platform on drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C12, Section B). Entering through the access cover (hatch) for the water supply line will only be allowed for replacement of the lower anodes (water supply gate would be in the full open position for this work). For replacement of the upper anodes (water supply gate almost fully closed), the contractor must enter and exit the work area from the opening in the tower deck (el. 869.25).  The contractor shall take note of the orientation of the opening for the gratings at elevation 869.25 for the water supply gate (see drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C12, Section B). The water supply gate is shown in its installed position (viewed looking downstream) in Section B. Note that the opening in the tower deck (elevation 869.25 to 866.25) for this gate is 90 degrees out of phase with the gates installed position. For the gate to have been installed into its slot, the gate must be lowered through the opening at elevation 869.25 into the area dimensioned as 12-0 inches (elevation from 866.25 to 854.25, See Section B), rotated 90 degrees in order to align the gate with the gate slot and then lowered into position. Also note in Section A, drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C12, there is a square grating (tower opening at elevation 869.25, (4 X  4) adjoining the grating for the water supply gate (shown in Section A, immediately upstream and adjacent to the water supply opening) which must be removed in order to pass the gate through the tower deck. See drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C93, Frame TFP-2 and Sections B and C for details of these openings. Note: there are three separate gratings that cover this opening. One is the grating for the 4 X 4 opening and the other two gratings are for the remainder of the opening (See drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C94, TFP-2 Gratings (TFP-2A, TFP-2B and TFP-2C)). This 4 X 4 opening could be used for passing tools, equipment, scaffolding, personnel, etc. down to the work area. The line of sight for the 4 X 4 opening is such that a portable crane (boom truck) placed on the tower service deck elevation of 895.00 could be used for passing equipment into the work area for anode replacement. Due to the overhang of the deck where the hydraulic cylinder is located for the water supply gate (See drawing O. & M.M. Plate NO. C12, Section A and B), there is not a direct line of sight for the use of a boom truck using the remaining opening for the water supply gate to properly allow transfer of tools, personnel, etc.  <BR>The Corps of Engineers has designated the intake structure (i.e. work area for replacement of anodes) as a confined space permit required work area. The contractor shall comply with all criteria for working in a confined space permit required work area.   <BR><BR>1.8	SITE SAFETY AND HEALTH PROVISIONS<BR><BR>1.8.1	General<BR>The Contractor shall develop all required safety and health plans and procedures consistent with 29 CFR 1910, 29 CFR 1926, EM 385-1-1 and provisions of these specifications. The criteria included in EM 385-1-1, Section 1, Program Management shall be followed by the Contractor when preparing the Accident Prevention Plan.  The plan, as a minimum shall include each of the topic areas listed but may include other safety and health criteria as deemed necessary.  Separate payment will not be made for providing an Accident Prevention Plan and all costs associated therewith shall be included in the applicable unit prices or lump sum prices contained in the Bid Schedule.  <BR><BR>1.8.2	Activity Hazard Analysis Procedures.<BR>The Contractor shall develop Activities Hazard Analysis Procedures as part of the Accident Prevention Plan.  The procedures shall define how the Contractor will implement the Activity Hazard Analysis in accordance with the criteria in EM 385-1-1 and as further described:<BR>a. In accordance with the requirements of EM 385-1-1, the Contractor shall, prior to the beginning of each major phase of work, prepare an Activity Hazard Analysis for that phase of work.  This analysis shall address the hazards for each activity to be performed in that work phase and shall have detailed procedures and safeguards necessary to eliminate the hazards or reduce the risks to an acceptable level.<BR>b. The Contractor shall develop this analysis to identify the sequence of work, the specific safety and health hazards anticipated, and the control measures to be implemented to minimize or eliminate each health hazard. The Activity Hazard Analysis shall be job specific and shall address the following major points:<BR>	(1)  Activity being performed (i.e., identifying major phase).<BR>	(2)  Sequence of work.<BR>	(3)  Hazards to be controlled.<BR>(4)	Control measure(s) to mitigate the hazards.<BR>c. A work phase in the analysis is defined as a major operation involving a type of work that presents hazards that must be abated or controlled and that have not been experienced in previous operations, or when a new subcontractor or work crew is to perform the work. Two work phases that the contractor shall include are: <BR>1) access into and out of the intake structure and <BR>2) set up for removal and installation of the anodes in the gate slots. (for example, will the contractor be working from a ladder or scaffolding for replacement of the upper anodes, etc.?)<BR>d. The analysis for each major phase of work will be discussed by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer's authorized representative (COR).  Work shall not proceed on that phase until the Contractor's Activity Hazardous Analysis Procedures have been accepted by the COR.<BR><BR>1.9.  Confined Space Requirements.<BR>The Corps of Engineers defines the control tower intake structure as a confined space, permit required work area when working in and around the gates. The contractor shall follow and comply with all OSHA and Corps of Engineers (Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1, current version) requirements for a confined space, permit required work area. A submittal will be required (for approval by the government) for this phase of the work. The contractor shall note in the required submittal for Confined Space Procedures the equipment to be used (i.e. air monitor, safety harness, tripod (if used), standby personnel, etc.), certificates of training for personnel entering the confined space and method of communication for personnel working within the confined space. This list is not all inclusive of the submittal information required.<BR><BR>NOTE:  Remaining parts of specifications - Part 2 (Submittals), Part 3 (Products), and Part 4 (Execution) - may be obtained free from cynthia.a.clark@usace.army.mil or 816-389-3009.<BR><BR>CLAUSES:  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this synopsis/solicitation and are incorporated by reference:<BR><BR>52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors<BR>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification<BR>52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions<BR>52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required, in which the following are selected: 52.219-<BR> 	     6; 52.219-26; 52.225-3; 52.232-34.<BR>52.217-8, Option to Extend Services<BR>52.217-9, Option to Extend Term of Contract<BR>52.228-5, InsuranceWork on a Government Installation<BR>52.222-26, Equal Opportunity<BR>52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Veterans<BR>52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities<BR>52.222-37, Employment Reports on Veterans<BR>52.222-41, Service Contract Act<BR>52.222-42, Statement of Equivalent Rates <BR>52.232-18, Availability of Funds<BR>52.232-33, Payment by EFT, CCR Registration<BR>52.236-4035, US Army Corps of Engineers Safety & Health Requirements Manual EM 385-1-1<BR>52.237-1, Site Visit<BR>52.237-2, Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment and Vegetation<BR>52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference<BR>52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference<BR> 	<BR>The following Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions, 252.204-7004 Required CCR Registration.

FAR provision 52.212-1 [Instructions to Offerors  Commercial] applies to this acquisition to include the following addenda:  All offerors are cautioned that if selected for award, they must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) program.  The CCR can be accessed via the internet at www.ccr.gov/  .  Confirmation of CCR registration will be validated prior to awarding a contract.  Evaluation Factors: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. 1. Technical Capability; Explain how your company will meet the scope of work paragraphs A.1.1 through a.1.5. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing sate and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors. 3. Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium. The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.

RFP EAC-RDV-08-R001 STATEMENT OF WORK  
ASSISTANCE TO THE UNITED STATES ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION (EAC) FOR PERFORMING A VOTING SYSTEMS RISK ASSESSMENT 
1.	Background. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) established the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for the compilation of information and review of procedures with respect to the administration of Federal elections. Part 3 of HAVA describes the duties of the EAC in relation to the adoption of voluntary voting system guidelines. Section 222(b)(1) requires the Executive Director to take into consideration the recommendations of the Technical Guidelines Development Committee (TGDC) when developing or modifying these guidelines. 
 
In August 2007, the TGDC delivered a set of recommendations for the next version of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) to the EAC. These recommendations considerably expand the number of security requirements for voting systems. They also introduce several new concepts to be applied in system design and testing. The EAC must decide how to utilize these recommendations as they create the next iteration of the EAC voting system standards. This requires answering the question of how to specify a sufficient level of security protection without requiring disproportionate tradeoffs against other desirable attributes such as ease of use, efficiency of operation, and reasonable cost. At present there is no federal analysis of the security threats to voting systems and the potential resulting harms. Thus there is an insufficient basis for determining what constitutes an acceptable level of risk. Without such a benchmark, it is impossible to make an informed and valid decision on what constitutes a sufficient level of security protection. 
To gather input for its deliberations, EAC convened a roundtable of computer scientists to discuss voting system security. The group concluded that no definitive risk assessment model for voting systems currently exists, but one is needed to provide a framework for specifying security requirements. This is consistent with federal information security policy as well as IT industry security practice.  
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) (P.L. 107-347) Section 3543 requires all federal agencies to provide information security protections commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information or information systems. These concerns are not unique to federal systems. They apply equally to other computer-based systems supporting sensitive processes such as voting. 
FISMA states that this is to be accomplished by first assessing the risk and magnitude of harm and thereby determining the level of information security appropriate to protect the system. Then policies and procedures can be developed to cost-effectively reduce the information security risks to an acceptable level. As stated in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems: The risk assessment validates the security control set and determines if any additional controls are needed to protect the system. The resulting set of security controls establishes the level of “security due diligence.” The final determination of the appropriate set of controls necessary to provide adequate security for an information system is a function of the assessment of risk and what is required to sufficiently mitigate the risk. 
The EAC requires a scientifically founded voting systems risk assessment to facilitate making informed decisions relative to voting system standards. This assessment must encompass the complete range of voting system technologies – paper ballots, optical scan, DREs, web-based, etc. Two products will result from this effort. The first is a recommendation of an appropriate level of assurance for voting systems based on the analysis of threats and risks. The second is documentation of the methodology and models developed so the EAC and other stakeholders can utilize these tools independently without the assistance of specialized experts. These products will assist the EAC and the election community in fostering a broadly-based consensus on a prudent and acceptable degree of risk for voting systems by evaluating trade-offs, running sensitivity analyses, and performing cost-benefit analyses of proposed voting system security requirements. 
2.	Objective.  The objective of this contract is to procure the services of a well-qualified and broadly-based interdisciplinary team to perform a comprehensive voting systems risk assessment. In addition to creating reusable models and assessment tools, this effort will make a recommendation regarding what constitutes an acceptable level of impact for voting systems. The working hypothesis is that a “moderate” level of impact as defined by NIST SP 800-53 provides an appropriate level of protection. The risk analysis will provide data for examining this hypothesis and supplying the basis for either supporting it or recommending a different level. 
 
This effort is laid out in three phases. Each phase concludes with review and approval of the work product by the EAC and its Standards Board and Board of Advisors. The first phase will create two sets of reference models:1) election process models to define the operational context in which voting systems are used, and 2) voting system models by generic technology type (e.g., paper ballots, optical scan, DRE, telephone) to identify the variations in threats and potential impacts across the range of voting technologies.  
In the second phase these models will be analyzed to identify the threats associated with each voting technology and to perform risk assessments of the potential harms and possible mitigations for these threats. The end product will be a set of risk assessments for the range of voting technology approaches. The intention of this analysis is not to rate one technology as better as or worse than another or to identify the “best” system, but rather to identify the security requirements necessary for all types of systems to achieve a specified level of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Theoretically, with the appropriate mix of technical and procedural safeguards, every technology solution can provide an acceptable level of security. But achieving the appropriate mix for some technologies may be technically more difficult and/or expensive and/or entail undesirable tradeoffs against other important design considerations such as usability.  
In the third phase the Contractor shall present a recommendation for an acceptable impact level for voting systems with supporting rationale. The EAC will decide whether to use this recommendation as the basis for developing security requirements in future iterations of the VVSG. State and local election officials may choose to adopt this recommendation for performing assessments of the adequacy of security practices at the local level. Manufacturers and test labs can use this recommendation as a reference point for system design and testing purposes.  
Also in the final phase, the Contractor will document the models developed and analyses performed in a manner that will facilitate their use by the EAC, election officials, and other stakeholders such as advocacy groups and academics. As noted above, the goal of this activity is to enable the EAC and others to understand and use these tools independently without the assistance of specialized experts. To further this end, it is preferred that the Contractor employ widely accepted IT industry structured analysis tools such as Data Flow Diagrams and Unified Modeling Language rather than proprietary methodologies. 
3.0 Scope. The Contractor shall be responsible for performing all the tasks described in Section 4.0 below. It is mandatory that the Contractor team be interdisciplinary and broadly based in terms of knowledge and experience, both theoretical and applied. This should include academic researchers as well as security engineers, software engineers and others with direct experience in designing, developing, and implementing voting systems and other high security IT systems. It is essential that the team include personnel with hands-on election administration experience with a variety of voting technologies and administrative practices (e.g., central count/precinct count, early voting, vote centers).  
A substantial amount of risk assessment work has been done for voting systems. The Contractor is expected to review this work and utilize it as appropriate. In addition the Contractor is expected to be cognizant of commonly used risk assessment methods for secure IT systems.  The tasks described below are based on the process described in NIST SP 800-30, “Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems,” July 2002. It is required that offerors have experience with the application of this risk management methodology.  
Participants for review panels specified in Tasks 4.7 and 4.11 shall be identified by the Contractor in consultation with the EAC. The EAC shall be responsible for scheduling and convening reviews by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors, called for in Tasks 4.8 and 4.12.

 
4.0 Specific Tasks. 
1.	Update the project work plan.  The Contractor shall update the Project Plan submitted with their proposal and deliver the updated Project Plan no later than ten (10) days after contract award. The plan shall describe how the Contractor will accomplish each of the project tasks, and it shall include a timeline indicating major milestones. 
 
2.	Submit monthly progress reports.  The Contractor shall submit a monthly progress report within two (2) weeks following the end of each month. This shall provide a brief summary of the activities performed and indicate progress against the timeline. Any issues that could adversely affect schedule or budget should be identified for resolution. Budget status shall also be included. This report shall be submitted both in hardcopy and electronically (via email) to the EAC Project Manager. 
 
 

3.	Conduct periodic briefings for the EAC. Following the delivery of each monthly progress report, the Contractor and EAC Project Manager will discuss the research findings and work progress and address any issues raised in the written report. This review can be conducted by conference call. From time to time the Contractor will be required to meet in person with the EAC Project Manager to discuss work progress, schedule, and budget. The Project Plan should make allowance for this activity. The number and frequency of briefings shall be determined by the Contractor Project Manager and the EAC Project Manager as the work progresses. The Contractor may also be required to periodically brief the Commission and other organizations on their work. 
 
A two day program review will be conducted at the conclusion of Phase I. The purpose of this review is to evaluate work progress to date and validate time and resource estimates for the completion of the remaining tasks. The results of the Phase I tasks should provide an indication of whether the original schedule and resource estimates for the remainder of the work might need adjustment. The Contractor will formally brief the work already performed as well as the workplan for the remaining tasks. Any request to modify the schedule or level of effort for Phases II and III must be accompanied with a compelling rationale for the change. The Government will decide whether to adjust the scope of work so it can be completed with remaining contract resources or to commit additional resources. 


PHASE I – Create Reference Models (estimated 4 months) 
4.	Perform literature search. The Contractor shall perform a literature search and assemble a bibliography of election process models and voting system functional and logical definitions for a comprehensive range of technologies (e.g., optical scan, DRE, paper ballots, telephone, web-based). Existing threat and risk analyses shall also be reviewed. The project team is expected to utilize these materials to the extent feasible as well as perform their own analyses to produce a sound theoretical framework for identifying threats and performing risk assessments. 
 
 

5.	Develop federal election process models. The Contractor shall model the federal primary and general election processes as an information system. The purpose of these election models is to provide the operational framework for analyzing risk. It is anticipated that somewhat different models will be required for central count and precinct count election processes because the vote capture and tabulation functions are distributed differently. Other variations may also be needed. However, since there is considerable commonality between the different methods of organizing and administering elections, the result of this task is anticipated to be a basic election process model with several variations, rather than several divergent models. 
 
The models will illustrate how voting systems fit into the overall election administration process and provide the context for the assessment of risk in relation to the entire process. For example, a small number of voting machine malfunctions does not constitute a significant risk to the successful conduct of an election if there are administrative procedures for timely replacement of machines so voting can continue, and for retrieving votes cast on the malfunctioning machines so no votes are lost. To ensure that models comprehensively reflect actual practices, the performance of this task must involve consultation with election officials representing jurisdictions with varied election management practices. Types of factors to consider in selecting this group include: central/precinct count/by-mail, urban/rural, large/small, alternative language requirements, early voting, vote centers, ‘conventional’ absentee and UOCAVA voting practices, different types of voting systems. 
It is preferred that the models be constructed using Data Flow Diagrams, Unified Modeling Language, and other IT structured analysis methodologies, rather than a proprietary methodology. This has the advantage of employing concepts, terminology, and symbology in common use within the IT industry while being relatively easy for a non-technical layperson to understand. It also permits ease of analysis and comparison of characteristics across technical solutions. 
 
The model development process will begin with the definition of a set of election process functions and the data flows associated with these functions. The following list is provided only for the purpose of illustrating what is meant by ‘election process function’ and is expected to be refined and expanded based on the Contractor’s analysis:
            1. verification of voter identity and eligibility
            2. assignment of correct ballot style
            3. election definition
            4. election set up and validation
            5. presentation of ballot to voter
            6. vote selection
            7. vote verification
            8. vote storage
            9. tabulation
            10. reporting
            11. election auditing
            12. certifying results
            13. storage and maintenance of equipment and software
            14. poll worker recruiting and training
 
 
6.	Develop generic voting system models. The Contractor shall develop generic voting system models for a comprehensive range of voting system technologies: e.g., paper ballots, optical scan, DRE, web-based, telephone. The Contractor shall present a list of technologies proposed to be examined for EAC Project Manager approval at the initiation of this task. These models shall include such elements as 1) a system flow chart describing data flows, entry and exit points, and the relationship of programs, device drivers, data files, and other program components, and 2) a system schematic and description of all major subsystem interfaces between the election management system, voter interface devices, the absentee ballot subsystem, the results accumulation subsystem, and the results reporting subsystem. 
 
Integration of the system models with the election process model(s) will create a set of technology specific instantiations of the election process. To take function 5, presentation of ballot to voter, as a relatively simple example: this will be portrayed variously as a paper ballot, an optical scan card, an electronic ballot image, an audio recording, or other mechanism. Figure 1 provides an illustration of a Level 0 Data Flow Diagram for a model of ballot data flow in a DRE system where the data store ‘ballot definition image’ roughly equates to the presentation of the ballot to the voter. 
 
 

7.	Validate voting system models. The Contractor shall validate the voting system models with panel(s) comprised of representatives of the vendor community, system certification testers, election administrators, and other relevant disciplines.
 
8.	Support review by EAC Boards and NIST. Following the model validation activity, the Contractor shall provide documentation and briefings as required to support the review of Phase I results by the EAC Standards Board and Board of Advisors, and NIST. Phase I products will be revised as appropriate to reflect input from these groups. For schedule and cost estimation purposes, the Contractor should assume these reviews will be conducted concurrently and last for 2 days. 
 
PHASE II – Develop Threat Matrices and Perform Risk Assessments (estimated 4 months) 
9.	Develop threat matrices. The Contractor shall develop a threat matrix associated with each voting system technology model. This must include an analysis of the system vulnerabilities, the identification of the threat, the description of the attack to realize the threat, and the degree of difficulty to execute an attack (e.g., skill level required, special access, number of people). 
 
10.	Develop risk assessments. Concurrently with Task 4.9, the Contractor shall develop risk assessments for each voting system technology model. This would include such elements as identifying potential mitigations and their degree of effectiveness, assessing the ability to detect a threat occurrence, and the ability to recover from such occurrence. The end result will be qualitative and quantitative assessments of risk for each voting system model. 
 
11.	Refine and validate threat/risk assessments. The Contractor shall refine and validate the threat/risk assessments. The Facilitated Risk Analysis Procedure or other appropriate methodology shall be used for engaging a panel of subject matter experts to assign comparative rankings to the risks with an explanatory rationale. Mathematical modeling techniques will be utilized to the extent possible. 
 
12.	Support review by EAC Boards and NIST. Upon completion of Task 4.11, the Contractor shall provide documentation and briefings as required to support review of the Phase II results by the EAC Boards and NIST. Phase II products will be revised as appropriate to reflect the input of these groups. For schedule and cost estimation purposes, the Contractor should assume these reviews will be conducted concurrently and last for 2 days. 
 
Phase III – Assurance Level Recommendation, Methodology Documentation, and Update Process (estimated 2 months) 
4.13 Recommend voting system impact level. Using the NIST SP 800-53 methodology, the Contractor shall recommend an information assurance level for voting systems. The working hypothesis is that the “moderate” level of impact provides an appropriate level of protection for this critical function. Based on the Phase II work and other analyses as required, the Contractor shall confirm this protection level or make an alternative recommendation with supporting rationale. 
4.14 Document risk assessment model and methodology. The Contractor shall document the various models and threat/risk assessment methodology in a manner accessible to the sizable community of interest. This encompasses federal, state, and local officials; voting system manufacturers; testing laboratories; and public interest groups. Any mathematical modeling employed shall be described in such a manner that non-experts can understand the logical structure and how to exercise the models.  
If deemed necessary by the EAC Project Manager, a tutorial will be developed to assist users. If a determination is made that this product is needed, a contract modification will be issued to add this work. 
4.15 Recommend an update process. The Contractor shall recommend a process for periodic updating and exercising of the models and assessments as technology evolves and the threat environment changes. This shall include a process for collecting the results of any utilization of the models by election officials, public interest groups, academics, and others, that may be of general interest to the election community.  
5.0 Contract Type. The contract type is Time and Materials. 
 
6.0 Place of Performance. The principal place of performance will be the Contractor’s place of business. Meetings and occasional work efforts may be conducted at the EAC offices from time to time. The Task 4.7 and Task 4.11 panels, if convened in person, may be held at the Contractor’s location of choice. The Task 4.8 and Task 4.12 EAC Board reviews will be public meetings and may be held at locations other than Washington, DC. For cost estimating purposes, assume one meeting on the West Coast and one on the East Coast. 
  7.0 Period of Performance. The period of performance is 10 months from date of award

<p>(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Have, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) Are, (<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>) (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">(j) <em>Place of manufacture.</em> (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.)

Other items included may be product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;

(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 
(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

(End of provision) 
The provision  52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. 
EVALUATION—COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

a. TECHNICAL APPROACH: 
The Government will evaluate each vendor’s Technical Approach to determine the vendor’s ability to provide the product meeting the Club 420 Collegiate Version specifications. Vendors shall provide sufficient and detailed related information to clearly demonstrate the vendor’s capability to provide products meeting these specifications. 

b. RELEVANT PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Relevant past performance for manufactures includes ten (10) years experience building and supplying Club 420 Inter-collegiate style sailboats for institutional use.

For all others, relevant past performance includes minimum ten (10) years experience engaged in the sale and service of Club 420 Inter-collegiate style sailboats for institutional use.

Vendors shall complete the designated section of the Contract Data Sheets (Enclosure 1) for up to three of their most recently completed Federal Government contracts (not to exceed three years since completion) in which the vendor either A) built and supplied Club 420 inter-collegiate style sailboats; OR B) engaged in the sale and service of Club 420 inter-collegiate style sailboats. The Contractor shall forward the Contract Data Sheet to the contract specialist listed on the document. The Contractor shall NOT fill out the questionnaire section of the Data Sheet. The questions provided are generally what are asked of the past performance source. However, the Government is not limited in obtaining past performance information. If the vendor does not have any Federal Government contracts, then list state, local, or institutional contracts, in that order. Data submitted other than that requested on the Contract Data Sheets will not be considered.  Failure to submit Contract Data Sheets shall be considered certification that the Contractor has no past performance for the Government to evaluate. A vendor’s lack of relevant past performance will be rated as neutral. The Government reserves the right to contact references other than those listed in the vendor's proposal.

c. PRICE: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness. Vendors shall provide their total proposed price for CLIN 00001, meeting the requirements outline in the specifications, and CLIN 00002. The total price shall be CLIN 00001 less the price of the CLIN 00002.

Basis of Award: This contract shall be awarded to the vendor whose offer is determined to represent the best value to the United States Coast Guard. Overall technical approach is considered to be more important than past performance; however, technical approach and past performance combined are more important than price. As the technical evaluation scores converge, price may become more important. 

 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d) The provisions of this clause shall be included in all subcontracts and consulting agreement wherein the work to be performed is similar to the service provided to the Government by the prime contractor.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-APO-1))

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

  (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b)(1).

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) are established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent local needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

Current OTI country programs include: Colombia, Kenya, Lebanon, Nepal, Pakistan, Sudan, Uganda, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. OTI country programs are designed and managed in Washington, with substantial input and oversight from field-based staff.  OTI annually operates ten to twelve country programs on three continents with an average budget of $100 million and 90 staff in Washington and in the field.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled employees make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization’s programmatic goals and objectives.

INTRODUCTION

PROGRAM OFFICE OVERVIEW

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Program Manager to support USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (DCHA/OTI) Program Office. The Program Manager, as part of the Program Office, will support country program operations through initial procurements and budget actions and other information management and reporting roles.  

The DCHA/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) II IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations.

In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, OMB, Department of State, and Congress.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD: EVALUATION CRITERIAStatement of Work Request7/29/2008Project: Create New Version of CAPS TrainingDESCRIPTION OF WORK The VA National Center for PTSD currently has a training course for how to administer the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) available on a CDrom created on Macro Media.  The current CD-ROM includes video of a CAPS interview, prompts to rate the individual items and then feedback on the outcome of the ratings.  There are also downloadable written background materials. We would like to make this training available on the VA intranet at vaww.ptsd.va.gov.  We have recently uploaded the CAPS to this intranet site and would like to make the training material available in a user friendly format to be used in conjunction with the assessment.  Expected award will not exceed $25,000.The CAPS is the gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assess symptoms over the past week.  In addition to assessing the 17 PTSD symptoms, questions target the impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and frequency and intensity of five associated symptoms (guilt over acts, survivor guilt, gaps in awareness, depersonalization, and derealization).  For each item, standardized questions and probes are provided.  As part of the trauma assessment (Criterion A), the Life Events Checklist is used to identify traumatic stressors experienced. The goal is to adapt the CAPS training CD into an online, interactive educational course that is more engaging than the current document and better suited to appeal to today's clinicians.  The most effective online courses today take advantage of a full range of multimedia techniques including color, movement, sound, video, and engage the learner. We seek a contractor who can satisfy these stated goals.Specifically the course will be designed to instruct clinicians how to use the CAPS assessment.  The course provides information on:  "	Symptoms of PTSD (numbing, hyperarousal, and avoidance)"	How to reliably administer the CAPS to diagnose PTSD"	The essential competencies for administering the CAPS"	Symptoms and diagnostic status over time"	How to determine severity of symptoms"	Evaluation of overall severity and global improvement The course must be 508 compliant per VA regulation 6102. It must also meet technical specifications in order to be uploaded to our intranet website http://vaww.va.gov/webops.  We expect that the amount of time it will take to complete the course will be approximately one hour in length and that the course will be broken into sections that will allow the user to complete the course in multiple sessions.We believe that many of the elements listed below will be necessary in order to satisfy the stated goal, but look to the contractor to specify how to best meet the goals.  Possible elements include:"	Audio voice-over narration "	Photo images and flash-animated collages of still images to personalize and humanize the content and render it more accessible to users "	Interactive exercises (e.g., on recognizing combat stress reactions) to engage the user and ensure content mastery (NOTE: no persistent cookies allowed by VA)"	Inclusion of VA and NCPTSD logosThe course will be tested at the Center to ensure that the module is relevant, accessible, and easy to navigate and then revised based on the Center's feedback.  DELIVERABLES:Contractor will provide final revised educational materials in web-ready format. Electronic files will be supplied that can be uploaded to the NCPTSD Website and will meet all of the requirements as specified in the description of work above.SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor must have expertise in creating engaging educational trainings and curricula that are web based.  Understanding public information campaigns and branding preferred. Additional expertise in traditional and emerging technologies is required to insure that the course is disseminated effectively.  The contractor must have experience with e-learning and web-based trainings.  Experience translating science into practice preferred. The online Course will be hosted on the VA intranet site accessible to VA employees only. If you have any questions or cannot download the RFP please e-mail POC at stacy.sullivan@va.gov

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] 
(1) Listed end products.

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act.

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

A)	Background

The Regional USAID Mission for Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR), with headquarters located in Almaty, Kazakhstan, is a mission with regional responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics. U.S. assistance is geared to assisting and strengthening reforms in the economic, health, education and political sectors in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

B) Basic Function: 

Under the supervision of the USAID/Central Asian Republics (CAR) Health and Education Director, serves as a professional Education Development Specialist and regional education team leader, performing responsibilities associated with delivering U.S. development assistance programs in the area of basic and higher education in Central Asia.  Work is concentrated primarily in the area of assignment, but the incumbent is expected to participate in cross-cutting teams to support projects related to education system development within other program areas.  The incumbent works in all areas of the sector, at the level described below, and specifically performs the following major duties and responsibilities. 

C) Major Duties and Responsibilities:

a.  Program/Project Development and Management Work			60%

Responsible for the conceptualization, design, documentation, and management of USAID  CAR programs devoted to the development of basic and higher education in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, including identifying and implementing necessary actions related to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.  Exercises independent judgment and applies broad technical knowledge of formal and non-formal education and trends in preparing or assuring preparation of design and implementation documents, concept papers, briefing and decision memoranda, authorizations, and Congressional notifications.  As the regional education team leader for USAID/CAR, assists the Mission in advancing the state-of-the-art of the formal and non-formal education development discipline, and in improving approaches in activity management.  

Develops and applies new program methods, approaches, and/or technology or extends, revises and adapts existing methodology to new and unusual situations. The social, cultural, economic, governmental, political, and other characteristics of the education programs/projects affect the success of the programs to such a degree that significant program activities must be specifically designed and modified to accommodate them. 

Designs and participates in education sector assessments, and provides technical leadership for regional and country-specific education strategic planning and portfolio reviews.  Presents and defends positions, as required, before annual portfolio and closeout reviews.  Provides guidance to technical offices, USAID mission management, USG country teams, and other groups, as required. Coordinates information and builds consensus among various organizations involved in the preparation and approval of various documents.  Advises Mission Officers on the implications of assessment conclusions, concepts, and on approved strategies for the design and implementation of ongoing and future activities.  Participates in USAID/Washington reviews of Mission program and project proposals which involve significant institutional policy issues, indicates strengths and weaknesses of proposals, and seeks to improve institutional arrangements and structures in order to promote growth and development.  Provides analyses of the effectiveness of major policy reform and non-project assistance interventions and those of other development assistance agencies. 

Manages a variety of highly complex and typically multi-year contracts and grants/agreements, entailing the coordination of efforts and the resolution of conflicting and controversial high profile issues with a number of parties both within and outside the host governments and implementing partners.  Exercises definitive technical authority regarding audit issues and disputes.  Coordinates educational program efforts for the most difficult programs or projects that have unusually demanding social, economic, cultural, governmental, and political conditions requiring the planning, development, and evaluation of matters of general precedent, extensive controversy, or wide coordination. Develops a data base system to collect information related to program/project activities.  Provides technical oversight of cognizant technical officers (CTOs) and activity managers responsible for monitoring and managing education activities at the country level.

b.  Geographic Area/Region-Wide Technical Resource			40%

Serves as USAID/CAR’s senior regional advisor on education , advising on and backstopping development assistance activities in the area of basic (primary and secondary) and higher education systems development.  Provides leadership, direction and vision for regional education activities.  Reviews and analyzes data; develops strategies, analytical models, and methodologies; and provides assistance and advice on education sector issues in Central Asia.
 
Serves as a technical resource to the USAID Mission and USG country teams in CAR in the identification of critical education issues within the region.  Develops plans and programs for technical assistance, capital assistance, and other activities in the area of assignment; participates in determining regional and country development objectives, based on cooperating country requests, perceived needs, U.S. policy, and determined priorities. 

Represents Mission interests on matters related to the sector at regional and country-specific conferences, technical seminars, and high-level policy meetings.  Works with cooperating countries in CAR regarding specific interests in education development programs, including the development of national strategies appropriate to their individual circumstances.  Ensures USAID education assistance is coordinated with other USG investments in education, and leads USAID/CAR coordination and collaboration with bilateral and multilateral donors involved in education activities. 

Acts as liaison with policy-level government officials for USAID/CAR to ensure that the Agency's –and broader USG- views and interests are promoted with respect to current and emerging education policy issues, and that those views are taken into consideration in bilateral policy development and implementation.  

Recommends human and financial resources needed to meet program objectives and fulfill management responsibilities related to education activities. Provides feedback on the performance of activity managers and specialists working on USAID education activities at the country level.  Performs other duties as assigned.

D) POSITION ELEMENTS:

a.  Knowledge Required by the Position - Mastery of education training program principles, development concepts, international best practices, pedagogical methods, and techniques to apply proven developments and theories to resolve major education challenges confronting CAR.  Expert knowledge of USG, international, and host-government laws and regulations, documentation and reporting requirements, and legal/regulatory processes.  

b.  Supervisory Controls - The supervisor sets the overall assignment objectives, program emphasis, and resources available. The Education Development Specialist and supervisor, in consultation, develop overall priorities and individual work objectives. The Education Development Specialist has the responsibility for independently planning and carrying out education development programs or projects; determining the approach to be taken and the methods to be used; resolving most of the conflicts that arise; coordinating the work with others as necessary; and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. The Specialist keeps the supervisor informed of progress, potentially controversial or high-profile matters, and problems with far-reaching implications. Completed work is reviewed for conformance to overall requirements, compatibility with other work, and effectiveness in meeting work and program objectives. 
 
c.  Guidelines - Administrative policies and precedents, ADS Chapters, mission orders, USAID special  directives, foreign assistance program definitions, and technical references are generally applicable.  The Education Development Specialist uses judgment, initiative and resourcefulness in interpreting guidelines and in developing and recommending new or substantially modified methods, guidance, or policies. 
 
d.  Complexity - The work includes a wide variety of duties requiring many different and unrelated processes and methods applied to a broad range of activities in the five Central Asian republics.  The geographic area of responsibility is quite broad, with significant differences in education priorities and environment.  Decision-making relies on a continual assessment of very complex and diverse circumstances that involve major areas of uncertainty in approach, methodology, or interpretation resulting from such elements as continuing program changes, technological developments, new or unconventional methods, unique or controversial aspects of USAID activities, or conflicting interests or ideas (as between Mission or host-country requirements and recognized educational training practices). This work sometimes requires devising new methods and techniques to produce effective results or to implement advances in the state of the art; establishing criteria for administering or evaluating educational training programs; or developing policy guidance and procedural material for use by Mission, host-country, and/or NGO/PVO personnel. 
 
e.  Scope and Effect - The purpose of the work is to plan and carry out a variety of important education development activities. The work involves establishing criteria (e.g., developing guidance or procedures for major activities); formulating projects; assessing program effectiveness; investigating or analyzing a variety of unusual conditions or questions; and providing advice and technical expertise to USAID/Washington, Mission personnel, host-country representatives, and others on specific functions or programs. Assignments typically involve education assistance problems that are particularly difficult, or that are systemic in nature. The work directly influences the effectiveness and acceptability of USAID development assistance and, frequently, the operation of other USG agencies or host-government institutions. 
 
f.  Personal Contacts - The persons contacted by the Specialist include subject matter specialists, training officials, contractors, attorneys, host-country officials, representatives of other USG agencies, professional organizations, organized or ad hoc groups. This level may also include contacts with high-level Agency and local and national government officials - several managerial levels removed from the employee. 
 
g.  Purpose of Contacts - At times the purpose of contacts is to influence, motivate, or persuade persons or groups who are typically skeptical, resistant, or uncooperative, and who must be approached skillfully to obtain the desired effect (e.g., negotiating policy milestones or timetables with government officials; influencing or persuading NGOs/PVOs to agree to use new or improved technologies about which there may be conflicting opinions; representing USAID as a member of an institutional committee on controversial topics; justifying the feasibility and desirability of plans or proposals that significantly affect NGO/PVO or host-government practices, such as financing reform, corrective action plans, or co-funding requirements for programs/projects. 
 
h.  Physical Demands - The work is primarily sedentary, although some physical effort may be required, e.g., walking, standing, carrying light items such as manuals or briefcases, or driving or traveling by motor vehicle in rural areas with poor infrastructure. Required overnight travel may be as high as 40% of the time.
 
i.  Work Environment - The work environment involves everyday risks or discomforts that require normal safety precautions typical of such places as offices, training rooms, and libraries. The work area is adequately lighted, heated, and ventilated. There may be occasional exposure to moderate risks or discomfort during program/project and country visits. 

E) MINIMUM QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: 

a.  Academic qualifications - Master's degree in area related to education development assistance or in one of the social sciences (economic, public administration, political science, international affairs, public policy international development).  

b.  Technical knowledge and management experience - Minimum six years of progressively responsible international experience in program management related to education systems development is required; experience specific to Central Asia is strongly preferred, although preference will also be given to those with experience in other post-Soviet republics or Central and Eastern Europe.  Knowledge of political and social aspects of Central Asian countries -and their educational systems in particular- is very important.  Preference will be given to those whose international experience includes strategic planning and analysis. Preference will also be given to individuals with knowledge of USAID procedures and systems for strategic planning, activity design, program monitoring and evaluation.  

c.  Leadership skills - Exceptional leadership and interpersonal skills are absolutely critical.  Preference will be given to applicants that can demonstrate experience in effectively interacting with a broad range of internal and external partners and clients, such as project beneficiaries, international organizations, government officials, universities or institutes, contractors/grantees, and NGOs. 

d.  Language and communication skills - Must be fluent in English (level IV or V) and have proven ability to communicate quickly, clearly, and concisely, both orally and in writing.  Must have demonstrated ability to produce high-quality analytical pieces and make persuasive, logical oral presentations to high-level audiences.  Proficiency in Russian (at least level III) is required, and knowledge of Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Turkmen or Tajik languages is desired.  
Computer proficiency (Windows, MS Office, etc.) is required.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Factors a) through d) are arranged in order of importance.  Technical Capability is of primary importance and includes two parts: 1) ability to provide the required conforming product or acceptable equal product and 2) the recycle/disposal process for spent blast media.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

However, if there is a way to also put them on a DVD (or other format) that would be fine."	Would HiDef be a requirement? ** I believe HiDef refers to DVDs.  Since these will be on web, there is no requirement for HiDef.  However, the contractor should explain why they would use this in their solicitation"	Is there a deadline for production? ** Must be done in 12 months.  Preference would be earlier.  Contractor should say when these can get it done."	Is there a requirement for a local production company?**No - filming is required within 100 miles; post production can be done remotely.

<DESC>Aug. 15, 2008 Update:Q&A's and amended documents are posted.
*IMPORTANT*
The correct email for the contracting officer is: Tim.Spencer@faa.gov________

The FAA, through the Office of Runway Safety, intends to enter into Funded Cooperative Agreements with users who agree to equip their aircraft with equipment which can display approved Airport Moving Maps or with equipment approved to provide aural situational awareness runway information to pilots.
The amount of funding awarded will be determined by the type of equipment being installed and the number of aircraft receiving the equipment and which airports and how often the proposer will be operating the equipped fleet.  In return for receiving federal funds the users will agree to equip their aircraft within a certain time frame and participate in the evaluation detailed in the Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP).
Multiple awards are possible.  The FAA estimates the total of all awards will not exceed $5,000,000.00.  The FAA currently has $2 million available to award, but may award additional cooperative agreements as funding becomes available.
Proposals are solicited in accordance with the documents herein.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is conducting a market survey to identify organizations with requisite qualifications and interest to provide the services stated herein.  This announcement is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  The information obtained from this market survey is for planning purposes only to assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this announcement will be the outcome of the competitive process. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this announcement.</p>
<p>NIEHS is seeking capability statements from interested and qualified sources to conduct toxicology studies for the National Toxicology Program (NTP). A variety of study designs will be utilized including (1) carcinogenicity studies, (2) reproductive studies, and (3) developmental toxicity studies.  Interested organizations must have the capability to conduct a portion of these studies with a perinatal (in utero and lactational) exposure component for the test animals.  These studies will further the mission of the NTP by testing chemicals that may pose a human health hazard such as industrial chemicals, plasticizers, flame retardants, food preservatives, drugs, pesticides and heavy metals.</p>
<p>A chemical-specific protocol outline will be provided by the Government for each chemical studied.  In general, studies will involve daily dosing of rats or mice.  The route of administration may be dosed feed, dosed water, gavage, dermal, or parenteral (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intratracheal).  Study duration may be from a few days up to 2-years or for lifetime.  Exposure may begin in utero or in young animals.  Treatment regimens, species used, endpoints to be measured, etc., may vary depending on specific chemicals to be tested and study goals; therefore, flexibility in design of studies is required.  In some cases, new testing paradigms may be developed with incorporation of unique endpoints.</p>
<p>The actual mix of studies may vary each year according to the types of chemicals selected for study.  However, the Government anticipates that the following mix of studies will be conducted each year: (a) up to 5 rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies with accompanying dose range-finding studies (14-and 90-day); (b) up to 5 multigeneration reproduction studies; and (c) up to 5 developmental toxicity studies with range-finding studies.  The Government may also elect to conduct 3 additional range-finding studies and one additional definitive carcinogenicity, reproduction, and developmental toxicity study in each year.</p>
<p>Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement should provide information regarding its ability to meet the capability and technical requirements below:</p>
<p>(1)    Analytical chemistry capabilities necessary to support the described studies. These capabilities include, but are not limited to, identity and purity confirmation of bulk test material, dose formulation homogeneity/stability, and periodic dose analyses using analytical methods provided by the NTP.  Test articles are typically provided by the Government.</p>
<p>(2)    The capability to use a Government provided data collection system for carcinogenicity studies. This system, known as the Laboratory Data Acquisition System (LDAS), was developed by the NIEHS/NTP.  LDAS is a computer application with hardware uniquely designed to directly collect study data and transmit it to the Toxicology Data Management System (TDMS) database. Specifically designed software is then used to aid in the evaluation and interpretation of study results.  The Government provides all hardware, equipment set-up and training for use of this system. The organization should also describe the features of their current system used to collect and report carcinogenicity study data.</p>
<p>(3)    For collection of reproductive endpoint data, such as littering data, must have a real time data management system that can provide resulting data (summary and individual animal tables) within 2 to 4 hours of collection.  A description of the features of this system should be provided.</p>
<p>(4)    Ability to conduct studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices and in accordance with the general requirements and recommendations for laboratory animal management contained in "Specifications for the conduct of studies to evaluate the toxic and carcinogenic potential of chemical, biological and physical agents in laboratory animals for the NTP" dated October 2006 and any subsequent revisions (http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/files/Specifications_2006Oct1.pdf).</p>
<p>(5)    Have a working laboratory in place for a sufficient number of years (for example, 5 to 7 years) prior to any proposal submission that will serve as evidence of experience conducting these types of studies.</p>
<p>(6)    Ability to demonstrate the capability and capacity for conducting these studies.  A brief description of the size of the organization's facilities should be provided.</p>
<p>(7)    The Principal Investigator, Toxicologist, Chemist, Veterinarian, Health and Safety Officer, and Quality Assurance Unit Officer shall be employees (i.e., not consultants or subcontractors) at the time of any contract award. The daily interaction and constant coordination of efforts needed among these discipline areas throughout the in-life portion of the studies makes it critical that they be physically and organizationally together.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are invited to submit capability statements for conducting (1) carcinogenicity studies, (2) multigeneration reproduction studies and/or (3) developmental toxicology studies (i.e., organizations may submit capability statements for 1, 2, or all 3 components).</p>
<p>Organizations responding to this announcement should submit a written capability statement which demonstrates relevant experience, skills, and ability to fulfill the requirements described herein.  The capability statement should contain sufficient enough detail for the Government to adequately assess your organization's experience and capabilities.</p>
<p>Interested organizations should submit five (5) copies of their capability statement not to exceed twenty (20) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, resumes, etc., for receipt by the agency no later than 5:00pm EST, September 16, 2008.  Any proprietary information should be marked as such. All respondents are requested to identify their organization's size and type of business. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made nor will respondents be notified of the Government's assessment of the information received.  Please submit information to:</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for approximately 410 Inlet Guide Vane (IGV) Kits for the J52 engine in the Navy’s EA-6B aircraft, and intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney, Military Engines 20, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108-0968.  The applicable NAICS Code is 336412, Aircraft Engine and Engine Parts Manufacturing.  The IGV kits consist of 2 bolts with self-locking heli-coils (P/N ST2601-11) and 2 spacers (P/N 2194927), and are intended to reduce the looseness of the bolts that securely fasten the IGV to the outer coupling.  Bolt looseness allows movement of the vanes relative to the outer coupling causing wear of the bolt, vane, and the coupling.  Continued wear to the vane may lead to loss of outer diameter retention which could lead to the vanes shifting aftward into the 1st stage blade path, causing 1st stage blade damage at a minimum.  This could lead to a possible In-Flight Shutdown (IFSD).  These IGV kits will mitigate this risk and prevent Driver IGV looseness by replacing the "tall head bolt" with a standard bolt and high-alpha spacer beneath the bolt head.  This will provide a longer clamped length, which increases resistance to movement due to vibration and thermal mismatch.  United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney (Pratt & Whitney) has rights in privately developed commercial technologies and processes incorporated into the J52 engine and has privately developed computer software needed for J52 analysis.  This privately developed data, along with the corporate expertise necessary to identify and correct problems with the J52 engine, are the sole property of Pratt & Whitney.  Given their involvement with the design, development, qualification, manufacturing, and continuing improvements of the J52 engine, their ready access to the original design intent, original engineering drawings, and the most recent design changes to the J52, and their immediate access to the necessary special tooling, special test equipment, and test facilities necessary to prototype and test proposed J52 engineering solutions, Pratt & Whitney is the only known firm with the technical expertise, technical knowledge, and technical data to provide the required IGV Kits.  It is anticipated that a task order under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) containing one firm fixed price (FFP) CLIN will be awarded.  The term of the task order is expected to be approximately twelve months.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received, however responses from responsible sources, if timely submitted, will be considered.  Note 22 applies.
