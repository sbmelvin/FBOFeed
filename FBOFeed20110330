<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality anticipates posting a solicitation to establish a mechanism to support the development and technical assistance of evidence-based measures and accompanying tools for use by all stakeholders in quality improvement, public reporting and value-based purchasing initiatives. To achieve this, AHRQ will establish a set of contracts awarded to organizations with combined expertise in healthcare quality and performance measurement within areas of quality, efficiency and patient safety. Request for task orders will be issued under the IDIQ mechanism that covers a wide range of measurement activities including but not limited to generation of evidence, establishing criteria and standards for measures and data formats, supporting measure specification and tool implementation, validating and testing measure tools as well as other activities.
<p><br />The procurement will be open to all offerors and will establish a set of IDIQ contracts. For this procurement, AHRQ anticipates making awards to multiple Contractors which are expected to have a broad set of analytic and content specific capacities. Successful offerors may be singular or include multiple subcontracting organizations working together to meet the varying needs of each task order.</p>
<p>To achieve the goals and objectives of future Task Orders under this IDIQ contract, Contractors must include the following 4 core competencies: analytic data capacity, measurement expertise, content expertise by disciplinary area and tool development capacity. The government anticipates the need for all of the capacities in this initiative; therefore multiple contracts under this IDIQ will be awarded to cover/ensure adequate access to all capacities. Capacity in each of the 4 core competencies will be a scoring criterion, but individual organizations can specialize within each competency.</p>
<p>AHRQ intends to establish sufficient IDIQ contracts to provide AHRQ a high level of technical and methodological capacity to develop a broad array of measures (i.e., used for multiple purposes, covering diverse populations, at various geographic levels, that span various clinical domains, various settings of care and various performance dimensions). Qualified Contractors must provide evidence of knowledge, understanding and expertise in the use of and need for healthcare quality measures and demonstrate substantial experience in developing, implementing and supporting an evidence-based measure development cycle and/or a systematic, evidence-based tool development cycle.</p>
<p>In addition, Contractors must meet the following requirements including but not limited to: <br />1. Understand and conform to the requirements of the Task Order Contract Mechanism; <br />2. Perform high quality, evidence-based measure development;<br />3. Enlist the committed, continuing participation of organizations whose missions and capacities will enable them to successfully complete task orders serving one or more of the four objectives;<br />4. Enlist the participation of methodological, statistical and clinical experts to enable the successful completion of measure development tasks;<br />5. Understand and meet the needs of AHRQ target audiences (including clinical, health care provider, purchaser/business, policy, and consumer/patient decision-makers);<br />6. Manage large, complex research projects and coordinate widely varying activities across multiple diverse sites and disciplines;<br />7. Collaborate with a large number and variety of research, quality improvement and healthcare delivery organizations;<br />8. Comply with AHRQ reporting responsibilities;<br />9. Engage in knowledge sharing activities.</p>
<p>AHRQ encourages submission of proposals from organizations that develop and use evidence-based measures for quality improvement, public reporting and in value-based purchasing initiatives at the local, state and national levels. It is desired that these organizations will also represent, in total, expertise that spans a broad array of organizations involved in health care delivery. These include, but are not limited to health services research organizations; health care delivery systems and organizations (inpatient, ambulatory and long-term care); health plans; academic health centers, research consulting firms; QIOs; VA sites and other governmental organizations; employers or employer coalitions; community-based collaboratives to improve health care, and other organizations that work at the national, state or regional level which develop and/or use evidence-based measures to facilitate improvements in the organization and delivery of health care services. <br /><br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality anticipates holding a Pre-Proposal Conference with the time and date to be determined, and addressed in the solicitation. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted on or about 15 days after the publication of this synopsis.</p>

This requirement will provide a software rewrite that will be used to upgrade our 9160 Teklogix Access Points in lieu of new security requirements.<br />This procurement has a period of performance of 90 days from the date of award.
<p>Psion Teklogix is the only source that can provide these services to the current system operating in our DDC Depots. This current system is from Psion Teklogix and is a standard across DDC depots. No other vendors are authorized by Psion Teklogix to provide the items pertinent to this requirement. Psion Teklogix will provide the software upgrade services.

<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<DESC>Purpose of the Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4, to inform industry on the basis of the FAA's decision to contact with a selected source via single source procedures.
The FAA, William J Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract to UNICOR.
The furniture is currently being used by the FAA to support their requirements and therefore unable to obtain through any other known source.
UNICOR brings the following essential data experience:
-	UNICOR products are compatible and offer interchangeability with existing standardized furniture components in use at the WJHTC. -	Furniture components from another source would not afford ability to integrate, repair, and reconfigure the office space in a cost effective and efficient manner.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to increase the maximum order amount of contract NNG06AZ12C withJ's Associates, LLC pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Thisaction will not extend the performance/effective ordering period of the contract.The Water Treatment Program contract NNG06AZ12C is an indefinite delivery/indefinitequantity, firm fixed price contract.  Quantities ordered under the contract schedule haveexceeded estimates and it is anticipated that the amount ordered under the contract willreach the maximum order amount in April 2011.  The government is currently preparing afollow-on procurement for Facilities Operation and Maintenance (FOMS) at GSFC which willincorporate this requirement for water treatment services.  The follow-on FOMS contractis scheduled to be awarded in November 2011.  To avoid a break in water treatmentservice, the Government is increasing the maximum ordering amount of contract NNG06AZ12Cto cover water treatment services during the 7-month period from April 2011 until theservices rollover into the follow-on FOMS contract.The current contract NNG06AZ12C requires the contractor to provide the personnel,materials, and equipment necessary to implement a comprehensive service-oriented WaterTreatment Program at NASA/GSFC.  The objectives of the Water Treatment Program are tominimize, to the extent practical, the effects of water and biological agents on themetal surfaces inside GSFC's cooling tower, chilled water, steam generating systems, andother closed water systems in order to prolong the life and maximize the effectiveness ofthese systems.Continuous and consistent chemical water treatment is critical to the ongoing operationand condition of the heating and cooling equipment in GSFC's Central Plants.  A break inservice poses an unacceptable risk to the Central Plants' support of mission activitieson the Center.J's Associates, as the current incumbent, has the in-depth knowledge of the on-sitefacilities and systems and personnel to provide uninterrupted continuation of missioncritical services.  An interruption and restart of the services currently beingperformed, with a new contractor that is unfamiliar with the existing facilities and thespecific requirements of the Water Treatment Program contract, would greatly jeopardizethe operation of the Central Plants.  Due to the time and substantial duplication ofcosts involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, J's Associates isconsidered the only contractor that can meet GSFC's needs given the short period ofperformance before the award of the FOMS follow-on contract.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 5:30 p.m. local timeon April 13, 2011.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Entech Instruments of Simi Valley, CA for the acquisition of a Preconcentrator for Atmospheric Level Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Analysis of Real Samples, to be used by Analytical Chemistry Division Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.
<p>The Analytical Chemistry Division, part of NIST's Material Measurement Laboratory, serves as the Nation's reference laboratory for chemical measurements and standards to enhance U.S. industry's productivity and competitiveness, assure equity in trade, and provide quality assurance for chemical measurements used for assessing and improving public health, safety, and the environment.</p>
<p>The Preconcentrator will be used for Volatile Organic Compounds program at NIST. Analysis of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) at nanomole/mole (ppb) concentrations and below requires large volumes of gas sample in order to have enough sensitivity by Gas Chromatography (GC). This process requires the preconcentration of the sample before injection to the GC. Cleaning of the preconcentration system is required on a routine basis. The absorbents used to trap compounds at ambient temperatures can result in sample to sample contamination. NIST requires a preconcentrator that has the least number of moveable parts in the system and coatings to minimize sample to sample contamination, and sample absorption.</p>
<p>Entech's Preconcentrator does not utilize solenoid valves, which alleviates contamination into the samples, and utilizes a unique stainless steel coating, Silonite <sup>TM</sup>, on their transfer tubing traps exposed to the sample, which will minimize sample absorption. As a result, Entech is uniquely qualified to satisfy this requirement as they are the only known manufacturer capable of providing a preconcentration system that meets our need to minimize sample to sample contamination, and sample absorption, and are the sole provider of this proprietary system.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by April 13, 2011 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Acquisition Management Division (AMD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, on behalf of the NIST/Metallurgy Division with Oxford Instruments America, Inc. for an upgrade to an existing X-Ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy System (XEDS).
<p>The Metallurgy Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the mission of promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness in the development and use of materials by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. The Division has a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) Hitachi S4700-II that is equipped with a 5-axis fully motorized stage (X, Y and Z tilt and rotation), and is used to investigate materials in its research programs such as advanced on-chip interconnects, semiconductor nanowires, and thin film and other nano-structured materials..</p>
<p>The Division has a need to upgrade the FESEM with a state of the art XEDS system to enable compositional analysis of various (metals, ceramics, and polymeric) materials in NIST's existing research programs.</p>
<p>NIST requires an XEDS system that integrates with the existing electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) system attached to the FESEM to permit phase identification of unknown materials, combining the compositional XEDS information with crystallographic EBSD information. The existing EBSD system is a Nordlys II system, originally purchased from HKL Technology, now owned by Oxford Instruments America.</p>
<p>The required XEDS system is a commercial item. The system must be hardware and software compatible with the existing EBSD system. The ability of the Oxford INCA Energy SEM 350 XEDS to integrate with the existing Nordlys EBSD system is unique to Oxford Instruments America. The language and control hardware are proprietary in nature and are owned by Oxford. Oxford has no distributors. Oxford Instruments is the sole, responsible source that can provide an XEDS system that will integrate with the existing EBSD system, and guarantee to meet original equipment performance <br />specifications.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by April 14, 2011, will be considered by the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to University of Memphis, 315 Administration Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152 to provide support in interviewing/surveying, recruiting, and processing of interview data for the “Alzheimer’s disease and social networks” project. 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people’s health and save lives. The Social Network Methods Section (SNMS) is part of the Social and Behavioral Research Branch (SBRB) within the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The mission of the section is to investigate the role of the familial social context in the dissemination of risk information and adaptation to disease risk. To that end, the SNMS seeks to develop effective family-based interventions to encourage communication among family network members about genetic risk information, as well as to mobilize related social support processes that increase appropriate screening regimens and health-promoting behaviors.

The University of Memphis will collect social network data for the research project entitled “Alzheimer’s disease and social networks.”  The current project aims to 1) evaluate social network systems (patients’ caregiving network and caregivers’ support network) of families affected by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 2) determine structural characteristics of caregiving and support networks associated with participants’ well-being and perceptions about caregiving, and 3) evaluate beliefs about AD and caregiving among family members of AD patients in relation to the levels of AD risk based on family history.  

Additionally, University of Memphis will provide interviewing, data processing, and administrative support for the project entitled, “Alzheimer’s disease and social networks.”  Contracting with University of Memphis to complete these tasks is necessary since the sample for this project is based in the community settings in Memphis, Tennessee.  University of Memphis will work with the Apple Grove Alzheimer’s & Dementia Care Residence in Memphis, TN to recruit study participants.  The staff at Apple Grove has developed a rapport with the patients and their families who receive care at their facility both in their residential and day-care programs.  The University of Memphis is a local institution that is trusted and very familiar to the patients and families at Apple Grove. The lead Principal Investigator on the study, has a significant understanding of the study’s objectives and possesses knowledge and experience working with families of individuals affected by dementia.  It would be disruptive for a different Contractor to conduct this study.

The Contractorwill provide the following support on the project:  

• The Contractor will administer the assessment surveys to study participants (in-person, online, and telephone interviews).  
•  The Contractor will conduct recruitment of the participants. 
•  The Contractor will serve as a point contact for participants throughout the project.  
•  The Contractor will enter data into electronic database and conduct quality control.  

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 611310, Colleges, Universities and Professional Schools, with size standard of $7.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-50 (March 16, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by April 4, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-151-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative. 

Note:  In order to receive an award from the NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov, and ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to issue a Firm-Fixed Price Contract to General Electric Aircraft (GEA) on a Sole Source basis per FAR 6.302-1, in order to provide production of an obsolescence replacement AV-8B Harrier Radar Display Computer (RDC).&nbsp; <br /><br />The AV-8B cannot fly without a display computer, which is also the back-up mission computer. Both the existing AV-8B RDC and Night Attack Display Computer (NADC) were identified obsolete in 2007, and are no longer supportable. No suitable substitutes exist for either computer. NADC obsolescence mitigation relies upon timely availability of cannibalized RDC retrograde assets, as old RDCs are replaced by newly designed RDCs. Remaining ready for issue (RFI) RDC spares are projected to last through FY14 but are already deficient for Fleet deployment pack-up requirements. GEA, which acquired Smiths Aerospace, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), is currently developing a new design obsolescence replacement for the RDC, including 12 engineering development units. Sole source award of the development contract to GEA was authorized by J&amp;A Number 08-25 in April, 2008, on the basis of insufficient technical data and rights (including software), technical&nbsp;and absence of market response. Development testing of the newly designed RDC completes in early FY-12. To minimize expected AOG accumulations in FY-15 (up to 4 per quarter), the form/fit/function replacement RDC production must be executed in FY-12, providing fully qualified RDC initial deliveries in FY-14. Competitive sourcing to a new manufacturer is high risk due to technical data/rights deficiencies, requirements for design productionization, and qualification testing for second source production certification which will&nbsp;unacceptably delay initial RDC deliveries, aggravating Primary Aircraft Authorized/Ready Basic Aircraft shortfalls due to increasing AOG.

This contract supports the delivery of a Nutrition Assessment, Counseling and Support (NACS) for HIV-positive individuals as well as Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC). USAID/Zambia envisions, subject to the availability of funds a total investment of approximately $10 to $15 million over a five year period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary purpose of the ZAMNACS project is to promote good nutrition and prevent malnutrition in adults and children enrolled in HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and at-risk OVC clients. The secondary focus is to improve the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and palliative care clients' outcomes by providing NACS in these target populations including prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) and OVC clients at clinical and community levels. Given current levels of coverage for treatment and care in Zambia ZAMNACS is not expected to cover all clinical and/or community sites. Rather ZAMNACS will provide overall training and show "proof of concept" for new interventions utilizing the NACS approach along with locally available commodities. It is expected that other projects and programs will then use these concepts to improve coverage across the country. The Offeror will assure the capacity and delivery of both the constellation of nutrition services and nutrition product interventions.</span></p>

In addition, the Offeror will include partnerships and other activities from the Feed the Feature (FTF) and Global Health Initiatives (GHIs), including potentially accepting additional resources provided by these initiatives in an effort to leverage and generate interest and other sources of funding to enhance the activities in nutrition.</span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Statement of work:  Contract specifications: stream macro invertebrate sorting and identification.  Contract requirements: The contractor shall sort and identify 36 composite surber samples of stream macro invertebrates.   For each composite sample, the contractor shall identify a SOO-organism subsample to the genus/species taxonomic level (RBP Ill). Standard quality control metrics shall be calculated for sorting and identification.  For each sample, the contractor shall estimate the density of New Zealand mud snails, richness (total taxa, EPT taxa, diptera taxa), composition (% EPT, % Diptera, % Chironomidae, %dominant taxa), and feeding measures (% filters, %grazers).  Six of these samples were collected immediately after an experimental treatment that denuded the stream, so we anticipate < 500 organisms in the composite samples.  Period of performance: The contractor shall start work within five business days after the award and complete this work no later than June 1, 2011.
Six of these samples were collected immediately after an experimental treatment that denuded the stream, so we anticipate < 500 organisms in the composite samples.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement seeking all business responses in order to determine business participation in this acquisition. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <br><br>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Fort Eustis (MICCC-E) is seeking information on business sources that can provide Army e-Learning courseware and learning management services for the Project Director Distributed Learning System (PD DLS) located at 11846 Rock Landing Dr, Newport News, VA.  This requirement is for a Firm Fixed Price contract.<br><br>The Distributed Learning System (DLS) is a modernized information technology infrastructure that provides access to individual and collective training, Army Modernization Training (AMT), and self-development courses to Soldiers and units, anywhere, anytime using multiple means and technologies.  The Program provides access to training for the Active Army, the U.S. Army Reserve, the Army National Guard, and Department of Army Civilians at no cost to the individual or unit.  DLS supports the Army goals of improved individual and unit readiness, less disruption of Army families, standardization of training and training management across the Army, and cost savings/cost avoidance for training events, while maintaining the quality of the training experience.<br>To achieve the Army's mission, distributed learning has become a mainstay of the training program.  The ability to maintain the full spectrum operations, for which the Army strives, hinges upon training being available to the Warfighter, wherever he or she may be located.  Soldiersand civilians who support them, at home and in the field need the training courses in order to ensure readiness.  Under this procurement, contractors will provide a library of Web-based Commercial IT/Information Assurance/Certification preparatory courses, business courses, leadership courses, management courses, and self-development courses.  The Army e-Learning will support the total population of the Army (Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard, and civilians) of approximately 2 million people.  The initial base of users will be approximately 900,000 users.  <br><br>The PD DLS requires contractor knowledge, expertise, and services to provide and deliver Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) training courseware and e-Books to Department of the Army (DA) Soldiers and civilians over the Army's DLS.  The requirement is for a "Turn Key" operation.  The government requires access to all services and content.  Specific products and services to be procured include:<br><br>1. Commercially Developed Courseware:  The PD DLS requires commercial state-of the-art courseware that is relevant to the Army.

This courseware will enhance the business skills, desktop skills, and IT professional skills of the students and will fully support a minimum of four distinct Army knowledge centers including: Microsoft Certified System Engineer (MCSE)/Microsoft Certified System Administrator (MCSA), Information Technology (IT) security/DoD 8570, Leadership, and Project Management.  This courseware should also provide learning paths to prepare a student to meet knowledge requirements for certification by vendors such as:<br> 	Business certifications by Customer Service Representative, Human Resource Certification Institute, International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA), IT Infrastructure Library (ITL), PRINCE2, Project Management Institute (PMI), and Six Sigma.<br> 	Desktop certifications by Microsoft.<br> 	IT Professional Certifications by (ISC)2, CISCO, CIW, COMPTIA, EC-Council, EMC, IBM, Information Systems Examination Board (ISEB), International Software Testing Qualification Board (ISTQB), LINUX Professional Institute (LPI), Macromedia, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems.<br><br>The technical relevance of the curriculum and courseware shall be maintained by updating and adding courses to meet new or enhanced versions of information systems, software, IT applications, business processes, and analysis techniques.<br><br>A significant number of the courses shall be approved/accredited through the American Council of Education (ACE) for college credit and accredited by regional universities and colleges.  The courseware provider should continue increasing throughout the contract period the number of ACE accredited courses and number of educational institutions that accept the courses for academic credit.<br><br>2. Deliver Courseware:  The Web based courseware shall be available 24/7/365 through a link from Army Knowledge On-line (AKO) and shall support download to user workstations to support off-line playability.  The Web-based courseware access shall provide a student registration link through the Army Training Requirements and Resources System (ATRRS).  The Web-based system should provide a capability to search for and locate courses as well as recommend and identify learning paths for students or user groups to achieve specific learning objectives or certifications.  The web-based system shall provide mentoring for users who are pursuing certifications. The Web-based system shall also identify all courses that are accredited by ACE.<br><br>The Web-based system shall accommodate delivery of Government provided 3rd party courseware.  Currently this courseware is Rosetta Stone foreign language training but other Government provided courseware may also require delivery.<br><br>The courseware must be capable of delivery to students via stand alone Local Area Networks (LAN) designated by the Army.  The courseware will be provided on CD/DVDs for the Army units to upload to the designated LANs and should provide the same search and learning path capability as the Web-based system.

Learning Management Services:  A learning management system (LMS) is required to support the students.<br><br>The contractor shall provide a secure and reliable platform to maintain and deliver the courseware without the requirement for additional hardware and software from the Army (unless the contractor is providing a CD/DVD to be loaded on a stand-alone local area network at an Army organization's location).

<DESC>Introduction: This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential large and small businesses that can provide various audit and analysis functions that will support H.R. 3590 Affordable Care Act's provisions for the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program and the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan.<br />The information from this market research will help CMS plan their acquisition strategy. Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA FABS contract or any other GSA Schedule contract. <br />Project Background:<br />Overview of ERRP
<p>The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) was established by section 1102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) enacted on March 23, 2010. Congress appropriated $5 billion for this temporary program and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set up the program within 90 days of enactment. Accordingly, HHS published an Interim Final Rule to implement the ERRP on May 5 with an effective date of June 1, 2010, and the program began accepting applications on June 29, 2010. The ERRP is scheduled to end no later than January 1, 2014 and will serve as a bridge to the new health insurance marketplace to be established through State-based Health Insurance Exchanges in 2014.</p>
<p><br />The ERRP was designed to provide financial assistance for health plan sponsors - including for-profit companies, schools and other educational institutions, unions, State and local governments, religious organizations and other non-profits - to help early retirees and their families continue to have access to quality, affordable health coverage. People in the early retiree age group (i.e., ages 55 to 65) often face difficulties obtaining insurance in the individual market because of age or chronic conditions that make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible. The ERRP provides needed financial help to group health plans that provide health coverage to retirees and their families, who depend on this coverage for their health care needs. The ERRP reimburses participating plan sponsors for a portion of the costs of providing health coverage to early retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents.</p>
<p>The anticipated services would support the Program Integrity efforts of the ERRP and possibly include assessments of program operations and data, to ensure plan sponsors are submitting accurate data, and to identify and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. The anticipated activities of this requirement would be as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain data securely, including working with existing contractors. Develop Joint operating Agreements (JOA) for work with contractors, including: the ERRP IT/Operations contractor, primarily to coordinate data sharing tasks; and the ERRP Call Center contractor, primarily to coordinate communications with plan sponsors. Obtain and transfer data in compliance with all applicable Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and CMS Information Technology standards. <br />o https://www.cms.gov/informationsecurity/downloads/ars.pdf <br />o https://www.cms.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/<br />&bull; Data analysis, statistical analysis, data sampling, including health insurance claims data.<br />&bull; Perform detailed reviews of information related to sponsors of health benefit plans, including reviews of plan sponsors': <br />o Programs and policies designed to identify and reduce fraud waste and abuse on the part of the plan sponsor.<br />o Programs and policies designed to reduce the cost of chronic or high-cost conditions.<br />o Representations about their plan.<br />o Notices to plan participants indicating participation in ERRP.<br />&bull; Perform detailed audits of health insurance claims data, plan enrollment information, and price concessions data (e.g. rebates) submitted by plan sponsors for the purpose of receiving reimbursement for high dollar healthcare claims through the ERRP. <br />o Audits may include travel to plan sponsor locations throughout the country.<br />&bull; Review and audit plan sponsors use of received ERRP reimbursements.<br />&bull; Answer questions and concerns from plan sponsors in response to ERRP payment adjustments identified through audits and analysis of their claims, price concession, enrollment, program reimbursement and program fund usage. <br />&bull; Conduct quality assurance and continuous improvement processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overview of PCIP</p>
<p>On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), hereafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Recovery Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152). Section 1101 of the Affordable Care Act establishes a "temporary high risk health insurance pool program" (which has been named the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, or PCIP) to provide health insurance coverage to currently uninsured individuals with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act authorizes HHS to carry out the program directly or through contracts with States or private, nonprofit entities. The PCIP program is intended to remain in place from the time of its establishment until the Exchanges established under sections 1311 or 1321 of the Act go into effect on January 1, 2014. <br />The effort would support the oversight and audit efforts of the PCIP and include assessments of medical and pharmaceutical claims data. The anticipated activities of this requirement would be as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Design and execute on-site health insurance claims audits (both medical and pharmaceutical) for 27 state PCIP contractors, one audit per contractor per calendar year in a chronological order specified by HHS. These audits shall evaluate whether PCIP contractor paid claims in accordance with approved plan coverage, benefits, and member cost sharing for eligible and enrolled subscribers.<br />&bull; Answer questions and concerns from PCIP contractors in response to claims audit findings and recommended adjustments/recoveries.<br />&bull; Audits include travel to state PCIP contractor locations throughout the country.</p>

<DESC>This partnering synopsis solicits potential partners to participate in a proposaldevelopment activity that addresses the technical objectives and development of acomplete mission in response to an anticipated Earth Venture Class InvestigationAnnouncement of Opportunity (AO) expected to be released in the Spring/Summer of 2011. Earth Venture is a Program element within the Earth System Science Pathfinder Program(ESSP) consisting of a series of innovative, integrated, science-driven approaches topressing Earth system science issues.  The goal of NASAs Earth Venture mission portfoliois to provide frequent flight opportunities for high quality, high value, focused Earthscience investigations that can be accomplished under a not-to-exceed cost cap and thatcan be developed and flown relatively quickly, generally in 5 years or less. Foradditional information on the Venture Class program and a copy of the draft AO visit: http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={EF2EDAC6-FDD5-B1F7-1C5E-ACD03EACA010}&path=init Participation in this partnering synopsis is open to all categories of U.S. and non-U.S.organizations, including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit institutions,the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as NASA Centers and other U.S. GovernmentAgencies.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Other MinorityUniversities (OMUs), small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), veteran-owned smallbusinesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBzone small businesses,and women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) are encouraged to apply.  Participation bynon-U.S. organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds,in which each government supports its own national participants and associated costs. This partnering synopsis solicits partners in all the following areas: scienceinstrumentation, payload operations, scientific algorithm development, spacecraft andlaunch operations.  (1) Science Instrumentation Partner(s) - LaRC is seeking potential partners for spaceborne science instrumentation in support of proposals which may include: (a) a compact,moderate resolution thermal infrared Fourier transform spectrometer; (b) instrumentationsubsystem including pointing system, optics, black body, spectrometer, detectors,optomechanical structure, and electronics; (c) instrumentation systems engineering andintegration; (d) implementation of techniques for meeting rigorous instrument calibrationrequirements that are traceable to international reference standards; and (e) validationand verification capability of sensor overall performance.It is anticipated that the selected science instrumentation partner(s) would provideconceptual instrument designs (with sufficient details to enable accurate mass, volume,power, telemetry requirements), operational concepts, calibration and characterizationdefinition and planning, payload constraints/interface analysis, technical risk analysis,and would participate in cost and schedule analysis as part of the mission conceptproposal.  (2) Payload Operations Partner(s). Payload operations support a variety of operationalmodes, from safe hold, to calibration, to other diagnostic modes, to normal (baseline)data taking modes.  The proposed payload may require special events operational support(e.g., calibration fields of view, thermal cycling, or other operational support) oncommand throughout the mission life. Therefore, potential partners are sought to providepayload operation solutions that represent enhanced capability for smart payloads anddistributed planning and implementation. (3) Scientific Algorithm Development Partner(s). The Principal Investigator and selectCo-Investigator(s) will be responsible for generating the missions Algorithm TheoreticalBasis Documents (ATBDs). These documents include the physical and mathematicaldescription of the algorithms to be used in the generation of data products. Therefore,potential partners are being sought for development of the processing environment (i.e.,tools for processing, analyzing and fusing data using algorithms provided by NASA and/orproposal team members) and to perform routine processing of data (Levels 0 to 1; 1 to 2;and 2 to 3). An algorithm partner may also be selected under this synopsis to serve as amember of the science team and may support the development of specific algorithms. (4) Spacecraft and Launch Operations Partner(s). Potential partners are being sought toprovide cost effective access to orbit.  Offerors should describe co-manifest launchoptions, hosted payload opportunities and other innovative approaches to obtaininglow-cost access to low-Earth orbits for consideration in mission planning.  Launchoperations include all services associated with placing the satellite into its properorbit, including but not limited to; integration of the satellite with the launchvehicle, launch operations and range services.	It is anticipated that the selected spacecraft partner(s) would participate in designactivities related to achieving efficient integration and operation of the FIREXinstrument and mission operations, and would participate in cost and schedule analyses aspart of the mission concept proposal. The unique requirements of the FIREX mission are provided here:Notional FIREX Mission Requirements	Minimum Operational life: 2 years with consumables for up to 5 years	Nominal Orbit Altitude: 400 to 600 kilometers	Nominal Orientation: Local Vertical Local Horizontal (LVLH)	Orbit: Earth orbiting, 50 to 90 degree inclination	Payload risk classification of D should be assumed per NASA ProceduralRequirement (NPR) 8705.4 Risk Classification for NASA Payloads	Yaw maneuver may be required for payload thermal managementNotional FIREX Instrument Characteristics	Mass: Less than 100 kg including contingency	Power: Less than 150 Watt including contingency	Spectral Range: 5 to 50 micrometers (2000 to 200 wavenumbers)	Spectral Resolution: 0.5 wavenumber unapodized	Absolute accuracy: 0.2 Kelvin (2-sigma) over entire spectral range	Data rate: Less than 300 kbps	Instantaneous Field of View: 25 km at 600 km orbitEarth Venture proposed investigations will be evaluated and selected through a singlestep competitive process. This single step is the solicitation, submission, evaluation,and selection of proposals prepared in response to this AO. As the outcome of this singlestep, NASA Headquarters intends to select at least one mission to proceed to missiondevelopment for flight and operations. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts orother agreements, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for theinformation solicited.	It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at nocost to NASA) technical requirements, conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input,project schedules, and cost estimates.	If the proposal is subsequently selected, NASALaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the selected partner(s) forperformance of the proposed tasks. NASA LaRC is committed to transparency and openness in the generation of its science dataproducts.  Openness and transparency are critical to continued scientific and engineeringprogress and to building public trust in the nations scientific enterprise (NationalScience Board 2/11).   Consequently, it is anticipated that future contracts or otheragreements with selected partner(s) would emphasize broad dissemination and sharing ofinstrument testing, performance, and results with the science community/public.Partner selections will be made by LaRC based on the listed criteria:(1)	Relevant Experience, past performance.	This criterion evaluates the proposersrelevant recent experience, past performance in similar space flight developmentactivities. Substantive evidence of successful participation in similar developmentsshould be included.(2)	Technical Capability and key personnel. This criterion evaluates technicalcapability to perform the development and key personnel available to support thedevelopment. Evidence of staffing estimates with available key personnel shall beincluded. Past successful programs and technical contributions shall be included. (3)	Facilities.  This criterion evaluates the proposers facilities (development,testing, calibration, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of theproposed task. Instrument facilities for testing of space hardware and prototype hardwareare considered important to this opportunity. The proposer should discuss facilityavailability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives.(4)	Cost and Schedule control.  The proposer shall provide evidence of pastperformance of controls of cost and schedule on similar development and provide examplesof management processes utilized to effect and track cost and schedule.(Note: The Earth Venture draft solicitation includes a student collaboration incentive(defined as 1% of the mission cost cap). The student collaboration (SC) can take the formof an instrument development, an investigation of scientific questions, analysis anddisplay of data, development of supporting hardware or software, or other aspects of theinvestigation. Consequently, NASA LaRC is interested in SC activities from prospectiveofferors for the instrument and spacecraft that maximize the opportunity for teaching,learning, and success in contributing to the mission.  A proposed SC is optional and themerit of the SC will not be evaluated as part of this process.)RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this partnering synopsis shall be limited to 5 pagesin not less than 12-point font for each technical area of interest (i.e. offerorsresponding to one or more of the mission elements may submit up to 5 pages per eachelement). Responses shall address each of the evaluation criteria listed below.  Resumesof key personnel and a cover page that clearly identifies the mission element areaaddressed by the response do not count against the total allocated page count.	Inaddition, student collaboration activities proposed do not count against the total pagecount.All responses shall be submitted to LaRC electronically via e-mail by 4:30 pm EasternDaylight Time April 15, 2011 to Mary.S.DiJoseph@nasa.gov and Robert.B.Gardner@nasa.gov.Technical and programmatic questions should be directed to Mary DiJoseph atMary.S.DiJoseph@nasa.gov, or (757) 864 4089.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) under NAICS code, 541712, that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of providing technical support to R&amp;D facilities conducting characterization and calibration of a variety of visible and infrared sources and radiometers.</p>
<p>The Ceramics Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides the nation with calibration and measurement services in the ultraviolet through infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Ceramics Division requires Contractor support research on development of measurement techniques for elastic properties of materials and structures at the nanoscale.</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Ceramics Division, is currently conducting research on development of measurement techniques for elastic properties of materials and structures at the nanoscale, as part of a broader study of nanomechanical properties of materials and structures. Many advanced technology devices use materials and structures at the sub-micrometer length scale. Hence, in order to enable innovation and speed development of such devices, mechanical properties measurements are required at the nano-scale to optimize materials selection, manufacturing processes, and reliability predictions. A fundamental mechanical property underlying all aspects of nanomechanical behavior is the elastic modulus. Nondestructive modulus measurement methods are required for development of components and devices that make use of nanostructures such as ultra-thin films and nanotubes. Such structures have potential uses in advanced micro- and nano-electronic devices and sensor and actuator devices utilizing micro- and nano-electromechanical systems.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that a dynamic resonance method can be implemented using an atomic force microscope (AFM), a form of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), to measure material elastic properties with great spatial resolution. The method is based on the modulation of the resonance frequencies of an AFM cantilever probe tip through contact with a material surface. The technique is known as contact-resonance atomic force microscopy (CR-AFM). Metrology to ascertain the applicability of this technique to a wide range of structures and entities and to develop standards for AFM and CR-AFM indentation and shear modulus measurement is required. In addition, the exact effects of contact geometries and adhesion between the probe and nano-scale structures and entities on the measurements are unknown, such that material properties cannot be deconvoluted from structural responses at the nano scale. Metrology is required to deconvolve such effects in CR-AFM measurements. Finally, the effects of the large surface area/volume ratios and of potential nano-scale layers on the properties of nano-scale entities are unknown, as are the influences of such surface effects on CR-AFM and related AFM measurements.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to continue NIST development of AFM and CR-AFM metrology to enable adequate and reliable experimental methods for nanoscale elastic mechanical property measurements on nano-scale entities with a range of elastic behavior. To meet this objective, research is required to explore and understand the resonant behavior of AFM cantilever probes in both flexural and torsional modes and the effects of the probe-surface contact geometry, and elastic anisotropy and inhomogeneity effects, in modulating resonance frequencies. Research is also required to establish the relations between elastic properties and other mechanical properties, such as fracture and contact dissipation, and surface effects and length scales of nanoscale entities.</p>
<p>B. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use the AFM located in the Nanomechanics Cleanroom Facility of the Advanced Measurement Laboratory (Building 218, Rooms D010 and D012) and, if necessary, other AFMs within the Ceramics Division, to perform AFM and CR-AFM measurements on Si nanowires, Kevlar fibers, thin indium tin oxide (ITO) films and Cu-low-k dielectric interconnection structures, SiGe features epitaxially grown on Si wafers, and other materials supplied by NIST. The AFM cantilever probes will have dimensions and materials suitable for material modulus determination between 1 MegaPascal (MPa) and 1 TeraPascal (TPa) with better than 1 micrometer lateral resolution. The Contractor shall develop measurement methods for elastic, fracture, and dissipative properties at the nanoscale. These methods shall provide for accurate determination of different elastic moduli and dissipation over commensurate areas. The measurements shall be carried out on surfaces of entities and structures possessing nanoscale dimensions, with elastic anisotropy or with coatings. The experimental results shall be analyzed using appropriate theoretical models in order to adequately reflect the nanoscale behavior of the properties. The number of experiments shall be sufficient to derive reliable conclusions. For example, for correlation tests, values of R-squared greater than 0.8 or less than 0.2 will be expected to confirm or refute relationships. For material and device property value determinations, relative standard deviations of less than 0.3 are required.</p>
<p>Important functions of the NIST Ceramics Division are dissemination of research results describing development of new measurement methods and standards for advanced materials and outreach with customers and peer developers of such measurement methods. One dissemination and outreach mechanism is the presentation of the results through talks, posters, and discussions with customers and other researchers at technical meetings. Accordingly, the Division requires the Contractor to attend and present a research paper or poster at the Materials Research Society (MRS) meeting in Boston, MA, November 28 - December 2, 2011 in the symposium Functional Imaging of Materials - Advances in Multifrequency and Multispectral Scanning Probe Microscopy and Analysis, or similar or related meetings or symposia.</p>
<p>C. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>1. NIST Technical Note 1297, "Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results" (http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/guidelines/contents.html). <br />2. NIST Special Publication 811, "Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)" (http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf).</p>
<p>D. OBJECTIVES<br />The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, administration, and technical execution of this task order. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities. The Contractor shall complete the following tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1. <br />Study the fracture strength of as-grown, partially oxidized, and fully oxidized Si nanowires as a function of wire diameter. The Contractor shall develop a versatile and reliable AFM-based method for measuring the fracture strength of one dimensional nanostructures. The new method shall be required to be free of invasive attachments on the tested specimens (clamps, solders, etc.) such that the measured parameters reflect the intrinsic properties of the specimens. The Contractor shall develop an analysis that incorporates the distributions of bending stresses and bending moments along the tested nanowires and the evolution of these distributions toward the state of ultimate strength. The Contractor shall compare the values of fracture strength of the tested nanowires with those of thin film and bulk Si and SiO2.</p>
<p>Task 2.<br />Develop CR-AFM instrumentation and methodology for simultaneous access of flexural and torsional vibration modes of the AFM cantilever during tip-sample contact mode scanning. The Contractor shall use these types of measurements for out-of-plane and in-plane elastic modulus mapping of flat surfaces. The Contractor shall apply this new measurement development in the quantitative elastic modulus measurements of Kevlar 49 and Kevlar KM2 fibers embedded in an epoxy matrix. The Contractor shall perform out-of-plane CR-AFM point-measurements and mapping to measure the elastic modulus of longitudinal and transversal cross-sections of Kevlar fibers. The epoxy polymer elastic modulus of order 4 GPa to 5 GPa will provide calibration for the measurements. The analysis of the out-of-plane and in-plane CR-AFM measurements shall correlate the values measured on the longitudinal and transverse cross-sections of the two investigated types of Kevlar fibers. The Contractor shall compare the CR-AFM measurement results with those from instrumented indentation measurements on the same or similar specimens.</p>
<p>Task 3.<br />Extend the capability of CR-AFM and develop new methodology to provide quantitative measurements of dissipation at tip-sample contacts. The Contractor shall investigate the feasibility of adding the dissipation measurement as a byproduct of CR-AFM scanning. The Contractor shall develop an analysis that incorporates the contact resonance frequency and contact resonance amplitude signals acquired during CR-AFM scanning. The Contractor shall demonstrate this capability using composite materials with different elastic moduli and different damping coefficients. The Contractor shall apply this new measurement development to investigate local nanoscale variability of the mechanical properties (elastic modulus and damping coefficient) of thin ITO films and Cu-low-k dielectric interconnects. The spatial resolution shall be limited only by the size of the contact area established during measurements between the AFM probe and the surface investigated.</p>
<p>Task 4.<br />Assess the operational concepts, technological mechanisms, and capabilities of various emerging nano-scale mechanical property measurement techniques. The Contractor shall investigate the advantages and disadvantages of inferring the nanoscale elastic response of materials by measuring either the dynamic or quasi-static response of the probe-sample contact. The Contractor shall consider here techniques based on measuring the dynamics of the cantilever during contact mode (e.g., CR-AFM) or the deflection of the cantilever during contact or intermittent contact mode (e.g., techniques using the force-displacement response of the AFM). The Contractor shall investigate suitable microscopically-patterned specimens (e.g., SiGe features epitaxially grown on Si wafers) to assess the measurement sensitivity of such techniques. The versatility and applicability of various techniques shall be considered in point-measurements and mapping regions of interest on different specimens.</p>
<p>Task 5.<br />Attend and present a research paper or poster at the MRS meeting in Boston, MA, November 28 - December 2, 2011 in the symposium Functional Imaging of Materials - Advances in Multifrequency and Multispectral Scanning Probe Microscopy and Analysis, or similar or related meetings or symposia.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is conducting market research for a requirement for services to assist in the NIST Engineering Laboratory (EL) in the area of Disaster and Failure Studies. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) only, it is not a solicitation for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged. There is NO solicitation available at this time. Industry responses, as a result of this announcement, shall comply with the following paragraph titled "INSTRUCTIONS". Information provided in the RFI may be used by the DOC/NIST in acquisition documents.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Engineering Laboratory (EL) promotes U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness in areas of critical national priority by anticipating and meeting the measurement science and standards needs for technology-intensive manufacturing and construction in ways that enhance economic prosperity and improve the quality of life. Measurement science research and services include the development and dissemination of performance metrics, measurement and testing methods, modeling and simulation tools, technical data, guidelines, and the technical basis for standards, codes, regulations, and practices. EL conducts disaster and failure studies in support of this mission. NIST is a non-regulatory agency and does not set building and fire codes, standards, and regulations.</p>
<p>Contractor support may be required to assist the EL's Disaster and Failure Studies Program. This program provides for the establishment of teams to assess 1) building and physical infrastructure performance and 2) emergency response and evacuation procedures in the wake of disaster and failure events that have resulted in substantial loss of life or posed significant potential of substantial loss of life. <br />Study Objectives and Types of Disaster and Failure Studies<br />NIST may use any one or a combination of the options below in conducting an initial reconnaissance, a full reconnaissance, or a technical investigation using the Study Team:<br />&bull; NIST may lead post-event studies. In many cases, these will involve an initial reconnaissance and in-depth technical studies focused on the characterization of the hazard, the safety and performance of buildings and structures, and the associated emergency response and evacuation procedures. Private sector and academic experts may be involved in these studies through contracts.<br />&bull; NIST may coordinate post-event studies. In many cases, these will involve initial reconnaissance and full reconnaissance studies focused on the characterization of the hazard, the safety and performance of buildings and structures, and the associated emergency response and evacuation procedures. These types of studies may involve significant participation by other federal agencies with mission responsibilities and expertise. Coordination may include NIST leading a multi-disciplinary team of public and private sector experts and/or serving as an information clearinghouse while ensuring that duplicative efforts are avoided.<br />&bull; NIST may commission private-sector led post-event studies. In many cases, these will involve initial reconnaissance and full reconnaissance studies with NIST participation limited to guidance and oversight. These types of studies will typically involve significant private sector leadership and participation augmented with some public sector experts. <br />&bull; NIST may provide technical assistance in the reconstruction process for international disaster and failure events at the request of US agencies, industry, private organizations, governments of other nations, or international organizations.<br />The objectives of NIST's disaster and failure studies may include (1) establishing the likely technical factor or factors responsible for the damage, failure, and/or successful performance of buildings and/or infrastructure in the aftermath of a disaster or failure event; (2) evaluating the technical aspects of evacuation and emergency response procedures that contributed to the extent of injuries and fatalities sustained during the event; (3) determining the procedures and practices that were used in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the buildings and/or infrastructure; (4) recommending, as necessary, specific improvements to standards, codes, and practices as well as any research and other appropriate actions based on study findings; and (5) promoting, enabling, and tracking adoption of recommendations through improved standards, codes, and practices as well as any research and other appropriate actions based on study findings. NIST studies are documented in technical reports containing data, findings, and recommendations for consideration by private sector bodies responsible for developing relevant national building and fire model codes, standards and/or practices; federal, state and local building and fire officials for adoption and enforcement of national model codes and standards; and research performing organizations such as universities, national laboratories, and private sector entities.</p>
<p>NIST may require&nbsp;contractor's&nbsp;with experience conducting disaster and failure studies to assist its mission. The Contractor must possess a broad knowledge and applied experience in the field of engineering, the physical sciences, forensic sciences, and/or emergency management in one or more areas of strategic importance to EL, namely:</p>
<p>&bull; Performance of buildings and infrastructure in the following hazards:<br />o Earthquakes<br />o Wind-related hazards (hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms)<br />o Fire related hazards (community scale fires in the wildland-urban interface, structural fires)<br />o Water-related hazards (storm, surge, flood, tsunami)<br />o Human-made hazards (accidental, criminal, or terrorist) <br />o Failures in service or during construction<br />&bull; Evacuation and emergency response procedures, including occupant behavior and fire protection<br />&bull; Disaster resilience of structures and communities, including prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery at the scale of a single facility, a neighborhood, a community, or a region.<br />The primary focus of disaster and failure studies is on events that occur within the United States and its territories; however, NIST may conduct reconnaissance of international disaster or failure events when lessons can be learned that are relevant to U.S. construction. NIST's involvement in international disaster or failure studies generally will be undertaken in cooperation with other U.S. agencies, industry or private organizations, governments of other nations, or international organizations, for the purpose of establishing and/or improving U.S. practices, codes, and standards. NIST also may provide technical assistance on a reimbursable basis in the reconstruction process for international disaster and failure events at the request of other U.S. agencies, industry, private organizations, governments of other nations, or international organizations. The Contractor may be required to provide support to NIST for these international events.</p>
<p>Businesses with&nbsp;experience in the National Incident Management System, Incident Command System, the National Response Framework, and with coordination with state and local governments are invited to submit information that addresses the following:</p>
<p>Task Description:</p>
<p>NIST seeks to identify sources with the capabilities to work with the EL in support of the Disaster and Failure Studies Program. The anticipated tasks may require a Contractor support to:</p>
<p>1. Conduct disaster and failure studies. This may include assistance with the collection, transportation, preservation, storage, maintenance and security of data and artifacts collected; providing subject matter expertise for field assessment of damaged buildings and infrastructure including modeling and simulation of failure scenarios; and providing subject matter expertise for the support of study deliverables and research and development. <br />2. Identify, organize, and conduct multi-disciplinary training to support the disaster and failure studies program. <br />3. Develop and maintain a disaster and failure database to serve as an archival repository of hazard events, the performance of the built environment during hazard events, associated emergency response and evacuation procedures, and the technical, social and economic factors that affect pre-disaster mitigation activities and post-disaster response efforts. <br />4. Provide administrative and technical expertise needed by NIST for support of the Disaster and Failure Studies program and to fulfill its responsibilities under the National Construction Safety Team Act and other statutes and support disaster and failure studies, including assistance with study deliverables which may require writing, technical editing, graphic support and web design / hosting expertise.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will not issue paper copies of this request.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The responses to this RFI will be considered in the planning and definition of Future Naval Capabilities programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This Request for Information solicits industry and academic sources to express their capability to provide comprehensive or component technologies for use in or as an Advanced Active Shaft Grounding System (ASGS) for Navy ships and submarines. The subject system should include an integrated shaft current sensing capability, electrical impedance to ground minimization, shaft current control capability and electrical contacts for rotary components such as shafts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As discussed in more detail below, NRL seeks to develop a new ASGS design, with a new integrated shaft current sensing and shaft current control capability. The intention of this RFI is to obtain concepts for (1) establishing low-resistivity contact to the shaft and (2) methods of measuring and datalogging grounding system performance parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">This new system will have increased reliability and mean time between failures (MTBF) compared to the ASGS currently employed in the fleet, thus reducing repair/life cycle costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the system to be developed under the FNC will address the problems of (1) intermittent or inconsistent electrical and/or mechanical contact between the ASGS system and the rotating shaft, (2) poor reliability/maintainability of the system; particularly contact or wear components (3) weight and physical size of the system. The new system must have the capability of sensing corrosion and corrosion control current flowing down the shaft.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The legacy ASGS system uses a system of spring-loaded conductive brushes that ride on a contact ring fitted to the rotating shaft. The new system may use a similar arrangement or an alternative arrangement that provides a greater and more consistent degree of electrical contact and a reduced maintenance burden. NRL is particularly interested in systems that provide grounding through contact with no wear components or provide non-contact grounding approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The complete ASGS is defined as all components required to ground the shaft of the vessel to the hull and to measure the electrical current passing through the shaft to ground (ship's structure), though responders to this RFI may only have applicable technology to a component of the complete system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These include the following: shaft electrical continuity hardware (all components mounted/attached to the shaft, both inside and/or outside of the vessel's hull), current sensor hardware (components required to measure the shaft current at either an inboard or outboard location relative to the main shaft bearings and to connect the sensor with the control/monitoring unit) and control/ monitoring unit electronics (components needed to monitor, record and provide feedback to the onboard Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Responders to the RFI are encouraged to consider novel materials and material treatments, new electrical continuity concepts and designs to achieve the desired goals. These may include brushless systems or advanced brush designs incorporating shaft surface treatments to replace existing shaft-fitted slip rings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors can submit white papers on the entire ASGS system or on key components, such as the current sensor or electrical grounding system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Special interest exists in concepts for (1) establishing low-resistivity contact to the shaft and (2) methods of measuring and datalogging grounding system performance parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Present shaft grounding is accomplished on Navy ships using circumferential conductive bands attached to the shaft working that make direct contact with conductive brushes which, in turn, are attached to grounding cables. Innovative means of establishing low-resistivity (&lt;1 mV potential difference at 100ADC), consistent electrical contact between rotating components and ground are of interest. This includes technologies to form seamless joints in high strength silver alloys and/or innovative materials deposition technologies that would permit the installation of seamless contact surfaces on rotating components. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Additionally, robust methods of measuring and datalogging grounding system performance parameters of contact resistance, current flow through such a shaft ground are also of interest. This Grounding Datalog Unit (GDU) should be capable of measuring and storing conditioned multiple analog inputs (-10V to +10V range) as well as multiple channels of binary TTL-input alarm or fault indicators and at least two channels of unconditioned inputs (-200mV to +200mV range). This logging system shall allow a limited access user interface (requiring authorization or passwords to operate), allowing the user to change the frequency of the logging event based on need. The choice in frequency shall range between every 5 minutes to once a work shift. Sufficient memory space shall be provided to cover 1.5 years of data logging before overwriting will occur. Logging capability shall include the ability to transmit data monthly. Recall data capability shall include the ability to recall on demand and display all data that has been logged in the data file. Logging and data storage capability shall also include the ability to real time log and store data on demand at an interval specified by an authorized user. The GDU shall log and store information as to the date, time, and duration whenever the grounding system is shutdown. Upon each startup of the system, after a period when it has been shutdown, the GDU shall log and store all readings from of the system, to provide information on the shaft condition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There shall be a removable storage device access port (disc drive, flash media, other) installed to allow an operator to download the information from the GDU without compromising the integrity of data stored on the GDU.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research to determine the availability of firms for a potential competitive procurement. No award will be made from this Sources Sought. No solicitation, specifications, or drawings are available at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. Potential offerors having the skill, capabilities, and personnel necessary to perform the described ILMS services are invited to provide feedback via e-mail to Jonea Brown, Tom Sherman, or Vince Biller at jonea.m.brown@census.gov, thomas.m.sherman@census, or vincent.j.biller.iii@census.gov. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.<br /><br />Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential business sources for ILMS services at the U.S. Census Bureau, National Processing Center, (NPC), in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
<p>The NAICS INDUSTRY Code is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and the size standard is $25 million (average annual receipts for preceding three fiscal years), and the Federal Service Code (FSC) is D317, Auto News, Data and Other Services.</p>
<p>The objective is to select and employ an ILMS using the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) model to deliver capabilities now missing from Census logistics activities. The Software-as-a-Service model in a Public Cloud Computing environment will assure lowest fixed cost and the economical scalability needed to best serve Census Bureau needs.<br /><br />SCOPE: The ILMS and associated vendor capabilities must be flexible enough to support a wide range of scope &amp; size in the number of users and transaction activity. The decennial census, performed every 10 years, is a 2-3 year long effort, when Bureau headcount rises by 750,000 plus and 500 field offices around the Continental US, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico are opened. It has been called the World's largest non-military undertaking. <br /><br />During the other 7-8 years, activities are similar, but smaller in scope &amp; scale.<br /><br />ANNUAL AVERAGE<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years 1-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years 8-10<br />Inventory Transactions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,860&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 380,480<br />Outbound Shipments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67,369<br />In house Printing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 38.8 Million&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 149.1 Million<br />Mail Pieces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.1 Million&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 46.6 Million<br />&nbsp;Kits* Built&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 Million<br /><br />* Kits are one or more cartons (avg. 18x6 3/4x13") containing an average of 20 line items in one or multiple quantities. There were over 700 variations during the last decennial.<br /><br />PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Users will include personnel at 500+ field offices throughout the US and Puerto Rico. Large user population concentrations are at Bureau HQ in Suitland, MD and the National Processing Center at Jeffersonville, IN. Selected vendors, as well as quality personnel deployed at print vendor facilities, may provide direct inputs to the ILMS. Many decennial census users are temporary employees, so minimal training and ease of use are critical.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES: This section covers customer/user need and service imperatives.<br /><br />&bull; Phased implementation of a system to integrate planning and execution of Census Bureau logistics activity for decennial and all other censuses/surveys, including cross-functional visibility of activities/schedule completion.<br />&bull; Initial phase to include requirements for acquisition, inventory/order management and shipment consolidation.<br />&bull; Then process planning, scheduling and tracking, including vendor or in house print &amp; finishing operations.<br />&bull; Final capability provides complete material acquisition status from request through delivery (this information to be obtained from other systems or direct input by users).<br />&bull; Reduce number of steps and navigation required to perform routine inventory transactions.<br />&bull; Allow tailoring of screen layouts and reports at user level.<br />&bull; Control user access and manage restricted read/write authorization.<br />&bull; Planning/scheduling applications must readily interface with MS Project or other Bureau scheduling applications.<br />&bull; Provide materials catalog for online orders, with item image and description, plus ordering constraints.<br />&bull; Strong deadline/suspense capability/accountability to highlight delays in completing scheduled activity at any level; so all system users are informed and can assess potential impact by quickly identifying gaps and issues.<br />&bull; Internal messaging, so users can communicate direct on logistics matters or push messages to outside e mail or other tools.<br />&bull; Provide simplified user printer set-up.<br />&bull; Integral support for bar code data capture/input.<br />&bull; Incorporate data validation techniques, such as character sieves and field edits to ensure only valid data are entered. Provide associated control and auditing.<br />&bull; Collaboration tools to enhance cross-functional and parent-child interaction and permit highlighting priority tasks.<br />&bull; Strong scheduling tools at every level to compliment program and project master schedules, while permitting early identification of resource constraints and labor planning.<br />&bull; Easy item look-up.<br />&bull; Auto-generate Bills of Material from product/kit definition.<br />&bull; MRP II features and functionality, including demand planning, plus finite capacity scheduling and lean practices or other process analysis &amp; control approaches for optimal performance and productivity.<br />&bull; Inventory and warehouse management at central, regional &amp; local office levels; 5-600 separate inventories that roll up <br />&bull; Drill down capability to move directly from top level to detailed information.<br />&bull; Support standardized item description and stock numbering (Item master).<br />&bull; Separate Web testing, training and development site.<br />&bull; Strong Job Tracking features, including automation &amp; PLC interfaces, downtime reporting and schedule compliance.<br />&bull; Business Rules functionality for process control and improved productivity by sharing guidance among all system users, while ensuring consistency across functional areas.<br />&bull; HR, full Finance/Accounting and CRM are not required initially. Item cost data will be aggregated and passed to a separate Finance system. Limited labor cost information will used to track production and assembly expenses.<br />&bull; Implementation to be phased, starting with acquisition/inventory/warehouse/shipping, that integrates purchasing, material cost &amp; shipping data from other systems; then establish production planning and management, including program/project management. <br />&bull; Strong integral reports functionality, with suite of preformatted reports and ability to create on demand by users. Include materials status for financial reporting.<br />&bull; Consistent look/feel from app to app and page to page.<br />&bull; Good visual cues and straight-forward process flows.<br />&bull; Clear menus; auto population (especially for previous orders from same source); intuitive and easy to learn; minimize manual data entry.<br />&bull; Optimize use of warehouse storage space.<br />&bull; A top-to-bottom tool that is easy to use, requires minimal training and promotes accuracy and efficiency at every step.<br /><br />CONSTRAINTS: All Census Bureau systems require certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) prior to becoming operational. The Authorizing Official (AO) makes formal accreditation determinations based on the vendor's security plan. This action supports the regulatory requirement that every Census Bureau system be formally certified and accredited in accordance with this policy and the Census Bureau IT Security Program Policy.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0939<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Front Closure, Orange w/ Yellow Trim, Universal Size<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, front closure, orange with yellow trim, one-size-fits all or universal size</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0940<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Universal Size<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim , one-size-fits all or universal size.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0957<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Medium<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size medium.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0958<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Large<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim , size large.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0959<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, XLarge<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size extra large.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0939<br />Similar Items: 97591-(M-4XL)</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0940<br />Similar Items: 97591-(M-4XL)</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0957<br />Similar Items: 3079-00024, 86540</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0958<br />Similar Items: 3079-00023, 86540</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0959<br />Similar Items: 3079-00024, 86540</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 6, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Consulting Services for DOE EM: X-Teams and Coaching Training Sessions: SYNOPSIS
<SOLNBR>XXXSYNOPSISXXX
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:kyle.martel@hq.doe.gov">Kyle Martel, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management, Office of Human Capital and Corporate services (EM-71) has a requirement for a consulting project that will help EM develop a greater understanding of the X-Team model and the challenges associated with running X-Teams, provide coaching to existing teams, and help top management to support X-Teams within the organization.
The Government intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to LXT Group, LLC.  The period of performance for this award will be from April 14, 2011 through April 13, 2012. 
The consulting project will include six days of consulting during the 2011 calendar year with work covering: 1) coaching of existing EM X-Teams; 2) working with senior leaders on how to support the existing X-Teams and 3) leading 2 one-day workshops on the 4- leadership Capabilities, X-Teams, and distributed leadership models.
The 2 one-day training sessions will be conducted for a maximum of 60 DOE-EM HQ and Field Sites supervisors and managers. The class will be a combination of lecture, active discussion and classroom exercise.
The coaching segment of the project will involve a one day meeting with each team separately to assess progress towards achieving the established team goals and to create a plan for how to move forward.    Work with the senior leadership team will begin with individual interviews to determine senior management goals and assessment of the current set of X-teams. The data, combined with the data provided by the X-teams, will determine the content of the intervention with senior management.  
The consultant on X-Teams, Ms. Deborah Ancona, was chosen because of her pioneering research into how successful teams operate.  Her research has led directly to the concept of X-Teams as a vehicle for driving innovation within large organizations. Her book, ?X-teams: How to build teams that lead, innovate, and succeed? was published by Harvard Business School Press in June, 2007. Only Deborah Ancona, who developed the concept of X-Teams, authored the book X-teams: How to build teams that lead, innovate, and succeed, and trained EM executives at MIT can provide additional training, coaching, and guidance in effectively running and supporting the EM X-Teams.
The cost for the consulting project is $48,000.00 for up to 60 DOE-EM HQ and Field Sites supervisors and managers.  
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1],  as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  
This is a notice of intent and no solicitation is available for this requirement.
Interested parties may submit capability statement and rationale by April 14, 2011 at 9:00am EST via e-mail to kyle.martel@hq.doe.gov.  The written response must include a general statement for services mentioned in this announcement and past performance client information for similar work.
A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<CONTACT>Soo Kang, Business Advisor, Phone 2023773798, Email soo.kang@ed.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department), Federal Student Aid (FSA), intends to negotiate with Certain Software, Inc. on a single source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Certain Software provides a Registration and Attendee Management System that allows meeting planners and event organizers to collect all attendee details and registrations online. In addition, the contractor provides related training services and technical support services. The Department has been using the Registration and Attendee Management System to allow its employees and internal and external customers to register for training workshops, webinars, and conferences conducted by the Department each year.
<p>This proposed contract action is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures in lieu of exercising an option year in the current task order with Certain Software due to an expiration of the GSA Schedule under which the option was included. Several training workshops for Federal Student Aid Administrators and conferences have already been scheduled for the next several months, and attendants have been registering for those events in the existing system provided by Certain Software. Therefore, the Contracting Officer has made a reasonable determination that no other source can meet Government's need at this time.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties who feel that they can meet Government's needs must submit their capability statements to the Contracting Officer by April 1, 2011 at 4 p.m. EST. The Contracting Officer will review the capability statements and determine whether to cancel this notice and issue a solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is awarding a Purchase Order for the purchase of 45 each Filter, 410.5 MHz, BNC Male/BNC Female, K&amp;L Microwave, Inc. P/N 4C40-410.5/T1-BP/B, to K&amp;L Microwave, Inc. Sole Source Justification: The Government knows of only one source, K&amp;L Microwave Inc. The Band Pass Filter is specifically manufactured to operate with the National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Narrowband Frequencies of 410.075 and 410.950 MHz. The filters band pass characteristics are compatible with the ASOS communications between the ASOS Acquisition Control Unit and the Data Collection Platform. The use of another manufacturer's band pass filter could jeopardize the communications associated with ASOS by causing Radio Interference into Federal Aviation Administration communications systems located on or near airports, typically where the ASOS is installed and operating. The use of another manufacturer's band pass filter would require extensive field testing Government's expense whose costs could not be recovered by the difference in competitive pricing versus sole source. The Government does not have the design rights of the manufacturer's drawings for this part. Market Research: The Government conducted a market research and found there are no other band pass filters that can be compared to the filters manufactured by K&amp;L Microwave. If there were other band pass filters they could not be used without extensive testing. The Government could not recover the cost of testing if they had to compete for a replacement band pass filter. K&amp;L Microwave, Inc. is the only known company that can provide a band pass filter using P/N 4C40-410.5/T1-BP/B that meets the Government's requirements. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps under NWWA12001151181KLC on March 15, 2011 for a 10-day posting that resulted in no responses to the notice.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br /><br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>&nbsp; Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license, further develop, use and commercialize the INL's Active Acoustic Tunnel Detector (AATD). The INL may also be available to partner(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.
<p>Technology Description: The Active Acoustic Tunnel Detector (AATD) is an active detection technology capable of directly addressing a subsurface threat. This device combines portability and functionality into a single system capable of nonintrusive interrogation and detection of underground tunnels and voids. The AATD detector permits streamlined operation without the need for large, complex, or cumbersome equipment. By using the AATD, there is no need to deploy additional sensors, instruments, or personnel. This allows for an efficient concept of operation (CONOP) when discretion and minimal operational signatures are required.</p>
<p>Current Prototype:</p>
<p>Validated operational depth of field from 20 to 75 feet<br />Handheld version weighs approximately 27 pounds (plus laptop computer)<br />Compact and portable (24 x 19 x 5 inches)<br />Operational duty from onboard batteries allow for an estimated 80+ scans per charge<br />Short interrogation (scan) time of less than 16 seconds</p>
<p>Future Prototype:<br />Improved operational depth of field<br />Fully self-contained with integrated data processor <br />Reduced total weight of approximately 20 pounds<br />Improved signal fidelity with similar/shorter scan duration<br />Reduced operational noise signature for improved concept of operation</p>
<p>Intellectual Property: The INL has been issued one U.S. patent and one U.S. patent filing with three waiting review cover this technology.</p>
<p>Applications: The AATD can assist to protect the United States from illegal border transits including drug shipments, weapons smuggling, and human trafficking.</p>
<p>Commercialization Opportunity: The INL is seeking industry partner(s) to license and commercialize this technology. Interested companies with experience commensurate with the commercialization efforts are invited to respond to this announcement by providing a detailed statement of interest no later than sixty (60) days from the publication date of this notice. This statement of interest should describe the following company elements:</p>
<p>1. Related experience<br />2. Demonstrated ability to bring innovations to the market<br />3. Sufficient resources to accomplish further development and commercialization of the AATD<br />4. Interest in performing and/or funding cooperative research at the INL<br />5. Substantial manufacturing and operations presence in the United States<br />6. Preferred license arrangement (such as exclusive or nonexclusive, fields of use, etc.)<br />Companies deemed appropriate may be provided with further information on the technology. Such information sharing may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license may be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.</p>

A firm fixed price (FFP) purchase order is anticipated. The period of performance is one year with four option periods of one year each.

<p>Statement of Work<br />Background: MCC is a United States government corporation providing assistance to poor countries that are committed to good governance, economic freedom and investments in people. MCC has statutory authority to award development grants (called "compacts") to eligible countries to encourage sustainable development and alleviate extreme poverty through economic growth. To date, MCC's grants have ranged from approximately $60 million to as much as $698 million.<br />In September of 2010, MCC amended its Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) to provide that a government-owned enterprise (GOE) is not eligible to compete for MCC-funded contracts. Accordingly, a GOE (i) may not be party to any MCC-funded contract for goods, works, or services procured through an open solicitation process, limited bidding, direct contracting, or sole source selection; and (ii) may not be prequalified or shortlisted for any MCC-funded contract anticipated to be procured through these means, in each case, with certain limited exceptions described in the PPG. Under the PPG, a GOE includes entities controlled by a government as well as those owned by a government, in each case, whether directly or indirectly. A copy of the PPG is available for review on MCC's website at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/mcc-guidelines-programprocurement.pdf, along with the September 2010 amendment at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/guidance-2010001040102-ppgamendment.pdf.<br />In addition, a distinctive feature of MCC compacts is the requirement that each recipient government establish an accountable entity to manage the implementation of compact projects. As part of MCC's oversight responsibilities, MCC seeks to ensure that the staff of each accountable entity is comprised of individuals of good repute.<br />Scope: MCC seeks to acquire tools to help it perform requisite due diligence relating to its policies on GOEs and accountable entity staff, including:<br />&bull; Determining whether an entity being proposed for the award of an MCC-funded contract is a GOE; and<br />&bull; Thorough character vetting on all staff and directors of each accountable entity to ensure that individuals of good reputation are appointed.<br />Requirement: The contractor must provide on-line subscription service licenses to allow MCC staff to identify the corporate ownership structure of entities and perform background investigations on individuals in a fast and effective manner.<br />&bull; The service must include the ability to:<br />o Research entities to determine whether the entities are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by a foreign government; and<br />o Research politicians, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), anti-money laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), fraud prevention, government intelligence and enforcement, and other identity authentication, background screening and risk-prevention practices.<br />&bull; The service must allow obtaining character information regarding foreign individuals on a worldwide scale.<br />&bull; The service must allow the verification of the corporate ownership of entities, including parent corporations and subsidiaries, on a worldwide scale, with the ability to accurately distinguish between entities with common company names.<br />&bull; The service must have a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy searching.<br />&bull; The service must be supported by customer service representatives who can assist with performing searches, including crafting search criteria.<br />&bull; The information obtained through the service must be current, reliable, accessible via the internet, and comprehensive enough to provide MCC staff notice of alleged criminal activity, convictions, bankruptcies, regulatory violations, as well as association with criminals, terrorists, money launderers, human traffickers, and other individuals of high character risk or notoriety.<br />&bull; The service must provide for unlimited searching of relevant databases.</p>

<DESC><br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />Carbon Mitigation: In-situ Studies of CO2 Capture
<p>A. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Ceramics Division is currently developing a project on materials for carbon mitigation for application to clean coal technologies. One particular area of interest pertains to carbon dioxide capture from the coal-fired power plant smokestack. As we know, global warming is responsible for massive negative changes to our environment, such as violent weather and rising sea levels. Capturing of CO2 through the use of appropriate sorbents could mitigate these effects, thereby resulting in global peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Currently, more than 33% of global CO2 emissions are from coal-fired power plants, which represent the largest point source of CO2. Before carbon dioxide can be sequestered from power plants and other stationary sources, the CO2 in these exhaust gases must be captured and concentrated. Carbon mitigation technology has three components: capture, transportation, and sequestration. Carbon capture is the most energy intensive and costly component of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), estimated to represent about 75 % of the total cost.</p>
<p>The largest cause of efficiency reduction observed in carbon capture technology is the energy required to regenerate the amine solution presently used as the CO2 sorbent material. Mid-term to long-term opportunities to lower capture costs via improved performance could come from the development of energy efficient membranes and mesoporous solid sorbents. In that light, the development of a series of metrologies for a systematic sorbent performance analysis, and the construction of a physico-chemical property/performance database would be the key enablers to screen, select, and design energy efficient solid sorbent materials for carbon capture applications.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is two fold: (1) to develop in situ measurement techniques such as high pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) integrated with evolved gas analysis (EGA), and high pressure thermal gravimetric analysis (HP-TGA) integrated with evolved gas analysis (EGA), and combine them to address the need for: (i) metrologies related to CO2 adsorption/desorption performance evaluation of sorbent materials (with emphasis on zeolites, metal-organic framework (MOF's) materials, etc.)) and (ii) a physico-chemical property/performance database for sorbent materials. The successful development of these metrologies and property databases would accelerate the development of low cost carbon capture technologies; (2) in collaborations with NETL, begin to acquire information and data to bridge the critical knowledge gaps in terms of metrology, standards, and other key issues needed to advance the scientific foundations for lowering the overall cost of CCS.</p>

<p>TJP Software has been providing part time computer services/consulting in support of the PRB computer network, hardware and databases. The PRB has its own network, servers, storage, tape backups and other infrastructure. The PRB has highly technical requirements to accommodate the storage of ultrasound images, interface with the hospitals electronic medical records, coordination of clinical and specimen databases, computer support for lab equipment and general desktop support for all the PRB computers. Since we are off campus, all of these services are procured from vendors in a close proximity to the PRB. Given the complexity of the existing network and infrastructure and the vendor's already established technical relationships with Wayne State University and Detroit Medical Center (where the PRB is housed), it would require significant time, effort and expense before another vendor could be in a position to provide these services, resulting in a duplication of work/effort. This situation could lead to delay of services and could cause PRBs work stoppage/delay on certain programs or research. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Title:  Legal and Regulatory Assistance on Geologic and Ocean Resource Management Issues Faced by the National Park System
Description:  
The Geologic Resources Division (GRD) is one of several divisions within the NPS Natural Resource Program Center.  GRD provides parks, regions, networks, and the NPS Washington Office with expertise on minerals management, disturbed lands restoration, geohazards, soil and geologic inventories, planning, and the management of specialized geologic resources such as caves and karst, fossils, and coastal resources.  As part of this assistance, GRD policy/regulatory staff provide park, regional, and national offices with interpretations of statutes, regulations, case law, and policy.  GRD also develops and/or contributes to the development of regulatory, policy and guidance documents.  GRD policy/regulatory staff work closely with attorneys in the Department of the Interior Office of the Solicitor in these tasks.  For example, GRD assists ocean and coastal park units (units situated along the shoreline of or containing marine or Great Lakes submerged lands) with issues pertaining to NPS jurisdiction and boundaries as affected by geologic processes.  
The Ocean & Coastal Resources Branch (OCRB) of the National Park Service Water Resources Division is also a component of the NPS Natural Resources Program Center. OCRB was formed in 2007 to implement the NPS Ocean Park Stewardship Action Plan (2006).  One of the goals of the Plan is to increase NPS technical and regulatory capacity to help parks and regions address the myriad of complex issues facing ocean and coastal parks, including fishing, pollution, wildlife, climate change, sediment, infrastructure, invasive species, and restoration.  To help accomplish this, OCRB is working with GRD to develop long-needed guidance documents, including a Director's Order and several reference manuals.   
Another project that GRD is working on is the development of a rule making package to revise the NPS's nonfederal oil and gas regulations at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart B.  The NPS promulgated these regulations back in 1978.  Since then, innovations in extraction and mitigation techniques underscore the need for the NPS to improve and update the regulations.  As part of this rulemaking effort the NPS needs help in a variety of tasks, including but not limited to: drafting regulatory and preamble language, carrying out regulatory compliance responsibilities, evaluating existing regulations implemented by state and other federal agencies, maintaining an understanding of current oil and gas law, and developing a sound administrative record.
The number of issues warranting research and analysis outpaces the in-house capability of GRD and OCRB.  As a result, GRD and OCRB seek to obtain assistance from a Contractor in conducting regulatory and legal research and developing analytical and guidance memoranda and other regulatory or legislative documents.
Scope of Work:  
The Contractor shall conduct regulatory and legal research and develop analytical and guidance memoranda and other regulatory or legislative documents related to ocean and coastal issues and the nonfederal oil and gas rulemaking effort.   
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide the NPS with all labor and services necessary to conduct the needed research and prepare the requested documents in electronic format.  The work must be performed in GRD's Lakewood, Colorado office.  Travel to Lakewood is required if the Contractor is not located there.  
Specific research and analytical needs include the following:
1.  Nonfederal Oil and GasGRD has initiated efforts to revise its regulations at 36 CFR Part 9, Subpart B.  The NPS is currently preparing a draft programmatic environmental impact statement, draft proposed regulation, and associated administrative and compliance documents.   The contractor shall:
1.	Assist with drafting regulatory text2.	Assist with carrying out rulemaking compliance responsibilities3.	Develop an electronic and hardcopy administrative record4.	Prepare research memoranda on a variety of legal and policy questions related to the rulemaking effort, including, but not limited to: resource protection concerns associated with operations that are exempt from the current 9B regulations, penalties, electronic submission of permit applications, and fees for access across federally owned lands not encumbered by an operator's mineral right. 
2.  Ocean and Coastal Park Jurisdictional GuidanceOCRB and GRD have recently completed a second draft of the NPS Ocean and Coastal Jurisdiction Handbook.  This handbook discusses and explains NPS authorities and policies regarding various issues in ocean and coastal parks as derived from NPS regulations, various statutes, case law, and the U.S. Constitution.  Such issues include commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, commercial and recreational boating, invasive species, recreation, water quality, off-road vehicles, and sediment management.  The draft handbook is now under review by NPS Office of Policy for publication as NPS Reference Manual #39-1.  
The Contractor will help GRD and OCRB finalize the handbook by:(1)	Collecting and analyzing comments on the current draft of the NPS Ocean and Coastal Jurisdiction Handbook from the Office of Policy;(2)	Researching any and all questions raised in comments received; and(3)	Drafting or modifying language for inclusion in the final version of the handbook.
3.  Establishing, refining, and updating high-priority park unit boundariesThe Contractor will research and draft between 5 and 10 park unit-specific legal memoranda satisfactory to GRD, OCRB, the NPS Land Resources Division, and the Department of Interior Office of the Solicitor regarding the location and modification over time of the boundaries of particular ocean and coastal park units.  The park units included in this analysis will be those determined by OCRB, GRD, and other NPS offices as high-priority; that is, park units faced with sea/lake level changes, dynamic geologic features and processes, or other factors that necessitate analysis of that unit's boundary.  This task will require the Contractor to:(1)	analyze park enabling statutes, other statutes, and other applicable documents such as deeds, maps, and agreements, (2)	consult with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies, (3)	determine whether federal or state common law, or both, governs the legal outcome of geological shoreline processes in a given park such as erosion, reliction, and accretion, and (4)	analyze the likely impacts of sea or lake level changes and seasonal fluctuations on park shorelines.  
The Contractor will need to travel to up to two NPS regional offices (the NPS Northeast Regional Office and the Midwest Regional Office) during the performance of this task.  Estimated travel costs of $2,000 for each of the base and option prices must be included in the quote.  
These memoranda will then be used by the NPS Land Resources Division to update park boundaries as warranted and feasible, and by GRD, OCRB, and other NPS offices to help parks apply available authorities within the updated boundaries.
4.  Commercial and Recreational Fishing Reference ManualOCRB is working with ocean and coastal park resource managers on recreational and commercial fishing issues.  Submerged natural resources are not managed in the same way as terrestrial natural resources; harvest and enhancement are typically allowed in ocean and coastal systems, but not in terrestrial systems. Parks and state fishery management agencies often have different missions and goals (protection vs. harvest), and state agencies rarely focus on fishery resources within parks.  Some parks do not understand their jurisdiction and authorities.  OCRB and GRD will develop a fishery reference manual under DO 39 to provide guidance on implementing NPS policies and on managing fisheries within park boundaries. 
The Contractor will help OCRB and GRD develop the fishery reference manual by:(1)	Analyzing recommendations and comments on fishery issues received during development of the Ocean and Coastal Jurisdiction Handbook and in a workshop being planned for FY11 for park resource managers;(2)	Developing the first draft of the NPS fishery reference manual; and(3)	Revising or modifying the draft based on reviewer comments.

<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has a requirement for ongoing ordering of containers for the recycling of laser printer cartridges and the actual recycling of the cartridges as needed. TSA plans to establish a single, no cost contract to fulfill this requirement; however, the Government reserves the right to not award any contract and does not guarantee any order placements. The resultant contract award will one (1) year in duration with four (4) one-year option periods. The Government anticipates placing orders via no-cost delivery order. The services rendered are to be free of cost to the Government with the selected contractor entitled to keep the proceeds from recycling of the cartridges.</p>

<p>CLIN 10001 Delivery of Pre-addressed and postage pre-paid shipping containers (Option 1)</p>

<p>See Attachment 1, Statement of work for time(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance.<br />It is the Offeror's responsibility to be aware of all applicable clauses and provisions. For full list of Clauses and Provisions, see Attachment 2.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. <br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical Capability:<br />Your technical capabilities, as demonstrated in the written technical proposal, will be evaluated to determine your understanding and proven ability to provide the storage units as specified, maintain adequate stock and meet customer demands. In addition to technical capabilities, please provide an estimate on turnaround time for shipping containers to the addresses listed in Section 7.2 of the Statement of Work. The Government will evaluate which offeror represents the greatest potential to provide the most timely, efficient and reliable recycling containers and services for TSA.</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Criterion:<br />The following factor will be considered in evaluating the Offeror's past performance: Demonstrated record (as confirmed by references) of successful past performance of the same or similar projects of this scope on time within budget.<br />Provide past performance references for same or similar current effort as being solicited herein. Please include company/agency name, period of performance, point of contact, telephone and e-mail address. The Offeror shall provide two (2) separate (not from the same company/contracting officer) references with a brief description of previous projects and similar size and complexity. "Similar size and complexity" for the purpose of the evaluation means: similar in dollar amount; number of client/customer employees serviced and number of employees supervised. The TSA may contact those references during the evaluation process to verify relevant experience and level of performance. Even though this will be a no cost contract, you should also provide the dollar amount for the referenced projects. The Government may, at its discretion, obtain and evaluate information from sources other than those provided by the Contractor. <br />Each example of past performance shall include:</p>
<p>a) Contract Number<br />b) Contract Description<br />c) Contract Amount and Type of Contract<br />d) Period of Performance<br />e) Name, address, E-mail address (if available) and telephone number and FAX number of the customer (if a Government contract, please provide the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer and the COR. If commercial, provide the technical and contracting equivalent).<br />f) Size and complexity of the project.<br />g) Whether all options were exercised, if applicable.</p>
<p>Pricing Evaluation Criteria:<br />Because this contract and the resulting delivery orders will be of no cost to the Government, pricing is not a factor in the Government's evaluation.</p>
<p>Selection:<br />Technical and past performance, when combined are equal in importance. Price is not applicable.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />Offerors are requested to demonstrate their expertise through a written proposal. The written response to this RFP may be done in one (1) volume. The submission must not exceed 8 pages and must provide your firm's capability statement and past performance references to provide for TSA wide deployment and collection of the containers as stated above.</p>
<p>Firms responding to this solicitation are requested to submit a written proposal to TSA by no later than 2:00 PM EST (local time Washington D.C.) on Friday April 15, 2011. No telephonic proposals will be processed. All questions and proposals shall be electronically submitted via e-mail to Stephan.Batt@dhs.gov.</p>

<RESPDATE>043011
<CONTACT>Carolyn J. Randolph, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-295-1379, Fax 301-295-1716, Email carolyn.randolph@usuhs.mil
<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Bethesda, Maryland, intends to negotiate a on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1 (b), with Invitrogen in Carlsbad, CA, for the following data and services:
<p>Multiplex identification of human autoantibodies in human patient samples</p>
<p>This service will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with the procedures in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) and FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures).</p>
<p>Scope of work: Analysis of autoantibody profiles against more than 9,000 human<br />proteins carried out for 20 patient samples consisting of pre-treatment and post-treatment conditions for ten individuals. Additionally, the service includes the analysis of one positive and one negative control sample. Service includes the bioinformatic analysis of the raw data and paired comparisons such that within subject comparisons of the pretreatment and post-treatment conditions are made for each of the ten patients. The complete analysis requires less than 100 uL serum per sample. The entire project should be completed in less than 30 days time following delivery of the samples and initiation of the work.</p>
<p>Specific deliverables for this project are:<br />1. comprehensive report of data of positive antigen-antibody interactions for 20 patient<br />samples (10 pre-treatment and 10 post-treatment from 10 individuals)<br />2. report on the pairwise analyses of the pre-treatment and post-treatment conditions for<br />each of the ten individuals<br />3. all image files and other raw data generated by the work<br />4. telephone consultation on the interpretation of the data and reports.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on very specific services that Invitrogen provides; there were no other sources for these services available. Invitrogen is the only company that offers a microarray-based service for the multiplexed analysis of over 9,000 human antigen-autoantibody interactions as specified here.</p>
<p>Critical to this study are: (1) small amount of sample required (&gt;100 uL), (2) simultaneous evaluation of over 9,000 potential autoantigens and (3) expertise of Invitrogen personnel in the use of the ProtoArray platform and the analysis of the data that results. Therefore Invitrogen is the one source reasonably available to meet the needs of the government.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quote. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide all the services as outlined above. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses must be submitted electronically, via email, to carolyn.randolph@usuhs.mil. The deadline for the submittal of responses is&nbsp;30 April 2011, 5:00 pm EST.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

The use of new engine parts as specified in this acquisition is necessitated by the high frequency of engine overhauls for the Paxman engines employed on the 110' WPB Island Class USCG Cutters and the resulting loss in reliability and durability of parts reutilized with such frequency. Alternate part numbers shall NOT be accepted except if due to part number changes. All Offerors shall be required to identify the manufacturing source of the offered parts.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format outlined in FAR Subpart 12.6, current through FAC 2005-50 (March 2011), and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

It is the Government's belief that only MAN Diesel can provide the parts that match form, fit, and function to Paxman original equipment (OEM) parts, therefore negotiations shall be conducted only with this source unless other sources can provide written confirmation that they are authorized distributors of the OEM or have previously supplied the identical parts under contract to the U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Navy. Sources other than identified herein that are interested in responding to this notice must provide the following information: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics) and/or (2) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information relative to the above requirements. This information must be received within three (3) calendar days from the date this Notice is published.

<p>EVALUATION</p>
<p>Award shall be made without discussions unless the Contracting Officer determines discussions are necessary. Quotations received in response to this synopsis/solicitation shall be evaluated utilizing the following technical, price and price-related factors:</p>
<p>(a) Technical - In order for a quotation to be considered technically acceptable the offeror MUST submit written verification from the OEM that the offeror is an authorized distributor for the OEM. Quotations that are received without written verification shall be rejected as nonresponsive.</p>
<p>(b) Price and other price-related factors.</p>

<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or <br />the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

<p><br />Amendment 1 dated 12 NOV 10:<br /><br />&bull; The Point of Contact for all technical and contractual questions will be Amanda Reyes, Contract Specialist (Contractor) at Amanda.Reyes.1.ctr@us.af.mil. <br /><br /><br />Notes:<br />This is FY11 BAA announcement based off the previous announcement FY08 AFCEEBAA-08-001 dated March 27, 2008. FY10 BAA (Phase I and II) proposals are expired with the new FY11 BAA announcement. If you would like to be reconsidered under this announcement you will need to re-submit as stated below.</p>
<p>Synopsis/Announcement:<br />This solicitation constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Technical Division (TD), Technology Transfer Program under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement seeks out proposals that demonstrate and validate innovative, sustainable, and cost-effective technologies and/or methodologies that will lead to accelerated closure of environmental sites across the Air Force, eliminate or reduce hazardous material use and environmental release, and serve the Air Force's future environmental needs. Validated technologies and methodologies must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, policies and guidance in the Restoration, Compliance, Pollution Prevention, and Military Munitions Response Programs. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase or that have already been tested and validated multiple times in the field. The areas of need include:</p>
<p>1. Characterization - Proposals should focus on improved methods for effective detection, quantification, monitoring, fate and transport modeling of NAPLs and innovative methodologies for sampling, data validation, and human health and ecological risk assessments for explosive residuals at Air Force installations.</p>
<p>2. Emerging Contaminants - Proposals should include sampling and analytical methodologies or innovative treatment technologies for contaminants currently on USEPA's Candidate Contaminant List that have potential Air Force implications pending future regulations.</p>
<p>3. Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) - Proposals should describe technologies and/or methodologies that reduce the labor requirements, sampling and analyses of waste generated, energy requirements, or other costs associated with LTM programs. Such technologies could include new sensors, analytical methodologies, or statistical methods.</p>
<p>4. Pollution Prevention - Proposals should identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the release of hazardous chemicals or minimize the regulatory burden and cost associated with the use and life-cycle management of hazardous materials. Proposals should include some quantifiable measure for either reduced chemical use or release, achievement of Executive Order 13514 goals, and total process operational cost. Proposals involving Air Force Weapon Systems may be considered if compatible with existing technical order and specification requirements for targeted systems/component.</p>
<p>5. Remediation - Proposals should demonstrate/validate innovative and/or sustainable technologies for enhanced recovery of mobile LNAPL, removal of recoverable DNAPL, in-situ treatment of residual LNAPL in vadose zone soils, in-situ treatment of residual DNAPL in unconsolidated soils or fractured bedrock environments, or improved treatment of explosives residuals in soil, runoff, and groundwater.</p>
<p>Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I requires completion of a 2 page proposal online form (white paper), which is found along with instructions attached to this solicitation and can also be obtained at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. Additionally the U.S. Air Force "BAA Guide For Industry March 2008" is attached and is also on the BAA website. Each electronic submission shall address only one area of need and shall be in accordance with this announcement. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 16 DECEMBER 2010. Phase I submittals received after 16 December 2010 will be handled according to the rules under FAR52.215-1(c)(3). Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the selection criteria included with the proposal instructions. It is critical that proposals convey the requested information accurately and concisely to facilitate their review. Offerors whose proposals are judged innovative and that meet Air Force needs are notified electronically via email to submit a Phase II proposal; those not selected are notified accordingly. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. To be eligible for an award, submission of Phase I is required. Award may be made with or without discussion. <br /><br />***Please direct all question of a contracting and technical nature to the Point of Contacts below to help facilitate better coordination.

<DESC>Question 1: The new (24 Feb 11) Purchase Description/Specifications for the three ovens in this Solicitation do not address interior wall construction. <br />Does the Air Force still want Stainless Steel interior panels as specified earlier? In the 500 deg. oven this would be optional with aluminized steel panels as standard. In the 1,050 deg. and 1,250 deg. ovens, stainless steel panels are a must.
<p>Answer: All interior walls shall be constructed using any 300 series stainless steel.</p>
<p>Question 2: The new (24 Feb 11) Purchase Description/Specifications for the three ovens in this Solicitation states that installation and testing will be accomplished by the Air Force, and that a factory rep may be present. We will requote this Solicitation with separate pricing for our installation supervisor to be on hand during the tests. Will the government accomplish these tests in one (1) day, or should we plan on more than one day?</p>
<p>Answer: The Operational test (pp 10.2.1) can be run simultaneously on all three ovens and can be completed during a single 8 hour shift. The System Accuracy Tests (pp 10.2.2) can be run concurrently with the Operational test. The Temperature Uniformity Surveys take much longer and due to a lack of equipment, we can only run a survey on one oven at a time and would take longer than 1 day to complete all three ovens. However, the manufacturer's representative need not be present while that is completed.</p>

<DESC><br>1.  Request clarification on cost sharing.  Several Universities were concerned about being able to meet a 50% cost share ratio in today's economy.  Is the cost sharing mandatory?<br>RESPONSE:  Per the Supplemental Package, 8. Resource Sharing is discussed and as a matter of DoD policy is required.  "Offerors must provide at least half of the costs of the program to the maximum extent practicable."  The offeror can discuss factors affecting practicability of cost share for consideration by the Government, see Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 37.215(c) (37 CFR   37.215(c)).  <br><br>2.  Request clarification on subcontracting.<br>RESPONSE:  The subawards request within the solicitation and supplemental package is to encourage collaborative efforts with a prime recipient and other HEIs, specifically targetting HBCU/MI.  The subrecipient award should be as a collaborative effort and not as a standalone task when proposed by the prime recipient.  <br><br>3.  What type of internships is the Government looking for and who pays for the internships as referenced under Center Criteria #9, Supplemental Package, pg.  15?<br>RESPONSE:  The Government is seeking input/suggestions from offerors and has no defined plan in place.  The Army acknowledges that it no longer has an intern program, but the Navy and NASA continue to maintain intern programs.<br><br>4.  Can cost sharing be with other federal funds?<br>RESPONSE:  Per 37 C.F.R.    37.530-37.55 and the Supplemental Package, pg 16, the "U.S. Government resources may not be considered as resource sharing. Contributions listed below will be regarded as "neutral" with regard to resource sharing goals, and they will not count as either a government or a private company contribution to resource sharing goals. These include:  (a) cash or in-kind contributions provided by state or local governments (specifically for the BAA project proposal, and not generally provided for some other purpose) where the cash or in-kind resource is funded by the U.S. Government; (b) in-kind contributions by federal laboratories that are members of a proposing team (e.g., as in a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement), or (c) tangible products of past government funding that are legally owned by a member of a BAA proposal team (e.g. equipment developed as part of previous VLRCOE efforts and/or a Small Business Innovation Research contract)."<br><br>5.  "MACH-tuck" was not identified by NASA as a concern for high speed rotorcraft. Will there be a concern for this?<br>RESPONSE:  One of the benefits of the ability to reduce main rotor rpm will be to lower the incidence of Mach tuck.  High-speed capability is a goal that NASA is pursuing. <br><br>5a. In consideration of NASA's emphasis on large transport rotorcraft, has NASA <br>considered the issues associated with a large center-of-gravity (CG) shift?  Particularly, considering low speed operability, the Chinook model is an excellent<br>one with a wide CG travel to address passenger and military applications.<br>RESPONSE:  The CG effects on handling qualities and flight controls are being assessed in NASA's research on large civil transport configurations in the Vertical Motion Simulator.  There are technical issues to overcome with the large offset between the pilot's seat and the CG of the vehicle.    <br><br>6.  How does the NASA Subsonic Rotary Wing project plan align with the NASA road mapping exercises that were completed recently?<br>RESPONSE:  NASA did not include aeronautics in the road mapping exercises.  The roadmaps are primarily for space exploration technologies.  The roadmaps can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html <br><br>7.  Can you provide a list of work Universities can do in Rotorcraft Aeromechanics?<br>RESPONSE:  In Aeromechanics we are looking for improvements in all of our Technology Effort Objectives, as well as gain greater understanding in the physics of rotors and rotorcraft flowfields. We have made great progress in Aeromechanics Analysis but there is a need to improve our accuracy in areas where it is lacking. Three critical areas are hover performance, rotor structural loads and interactional aerodynamics (e.g. tail shake).<br><br>8.  What happened to fly by light?<br>RESPONSE:  Lots of Fly-By-Light research and bench testing in the 1990's by the Air Force.  It is widely used for avionics due to massive bandwidth requirements, but for primary flight control there are still key challenges:  timing must be deterministic; prove reliability in harsh environment; field repair/maintenance and supply; and the technology readiness level (TRL) must be raised.<br><br>9.  What is the damage mode for composites?  <br>RESPONSE:  Delamination.  Composite skins are very durable, and not prone to damage growth.  Near- and far-field effects make skins, which react shear, unlikely to propagate damage (delamination growth).  Joints, particularly bonded joints, are more prone to delamination growth from impact damaging events.<br><br>10.  Is the Army heading toward 2 level maintenance for efficiency?<br>RESPONSE:    The S&T objectives are to reduce maintenance inspections, reduce labor, reduce false removals and increase component time on wing.  The technologies being developed will apply to 2 or 3 level maintenance. The number of inspections (e.g., corrosion inspections) remains the same for 2 or 3 level maintenance.  2 or 3 level maintenance dictates where the inspection or maintenance action occurs.  Future aircraft may go towards a 2 level maintenance approach. <br><br>11.  Is the Historically Black College or University or Minority Institution (HBCU/MI) 5% goal mandatory?<br>RESPONSE:  The Government is encouraging collaboration with HBCU/MI with a goal of 5% of the value of total funded efforts under the agreement.<br><br>12.  Are US citizens the only persons allowed to work on all tasks?<br>RESPONSE:  US citizens are not the only persons eligible to work on all tasks.  As this Solicitation is for fundamental basic research in science and engineering at accredited institutions of higher learning in the U.S. where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly in the scientific community, export control regulations do not apply.  The institution of higher learning remains responsible for compliance with export control requirements, including access to technical data and equipment.<br><br>13.  What is the technology relevance during evaluations?<br>RESPONSE:  Proposals will first be evaluated as an integrated, balanced center and then the 5-year program technical tasks will be subjected to a scientific peer review by a team of knowledgeable scientists/engineers. The tasks will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to develop an order of merit listing for proposals and technical programs submitted under this announcement.<br><br>14.  What is the available funding annually?<br>RESPONSE:  $4M annually for a total of up to 3 agreements.<br><br>15.  What are the criteria for evaluation?<br>RESPONSE:  The Center Criteria and Technical Task Criteria to be used for evaluation purposes can be found in the solicitation and supplemental package.  <br><br>16.  Intellectual property rights - subawards - do they need to be worked out in advance?<br>RESPONSE:  yes<br><br>17.  What is the status of funding?<br>RESPONSE:  Government is still under CRA, but is ready to move forward.<br><br>18.  Are water ingress and water in composite structures good topics?<br>RESPONSE:  Yes, they are good topics.  The list of example research topics in the BAA for "Naval Operations" is not a comprehensive list. Topics outside the list but that address operation in a naval environment are not excluded. <br><br>19.  As a reminder, potential offerors shall submit all questions via electronic mail to the Grants and Agreement Administrator, Velvet Taylor, at velvet.taylor@us.army.mil and not the technical personnel or other Government contacts.<br><br><br>

<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with<br />FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a paper solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation number is MCC-11-0042-RFQ-52, and is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), with incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-48. A firm fixed price (FFP) purchase order is anticipated. The period of performance is one year with four option periods of one year each. This requirement is being synopsized under the North American Industry Classification System code 5411120 with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.00.

<p>Statement of Work<br />Background: MCC is a United States government corporation providing assistance to poor countries that are committed to good governance, economic freedom and investments in people. MCC has statutory authority to award development grants (called "compacts") to eligible countries to encourage sustainable development and alleviate extreme poverty through economic growth. To date, MCC's grants have ranged from approximately $60 million to as much as $698 million.<br />In September of 2010, MCC amended its Program Procurement Guidelines (PPG) to provide that a government-owned enterprise (GOE) is not eligible to compete for MCC-funded contracts. Accordingly, a GOE (i) may not be party to any MCC-funded contract for goods, works, or services procured through an open solicitation process, limited bidding, direct contracting, or sole source selection; and (ii) may not be prequalified or shortlisted for any MCC-funded contract anticipated to be procured through these means, in each case, with certain limited exceptions described in the PPG. Under the PPG, a GOE includes entities controlled by a government as well as those owned by a government, in each case, whether directly or indirectly. A copy of the PPG is available for review on MCC's website at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/mcc-guidelines-programprocurement.pdf, along with the September 2010 amendment at http://www.mcc.gov/documents/guidance/guidance-2010001040102-ppgamendment.pdf.<br />In addition, a distinctive feature of MCC compacts is the requirement that each recipient government establish an accountable entity to manage the implementation of compact projects. As part of MCC's oversight responsibilities, MCC seeks to ensure that the staff of each accountable entity is comprised of individuals of good repute.<br />Scope: MCC seeks to acquire tools to help it perform requisite due diligence relating to its policies on GOEs and accountable entity staff, including:<br />&bull; Determining whether an entity being proposed for the award of an MCC-funded contract is a GOE; and<br />&bull; Thorough character vetting on all staff and directors of each accountable entity to ensure that individuals of good reputation are appointed.<br />Requirement: The contractor must provide on-line subscription service licenses to allow MCC staff to identify the corporate ownership structure of entities and perform background investigations on individuals in a fast and effective manner.<br />&bull; The service must include the ability to:<br />o Research entities to determine whether the entities are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by a foreign government; and<br />o Research politicians, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), anti-money laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), fraud prevention, government intelligence and enforcement, and other identity authentication, background screening and risk-prevention practices.<br />&bull; The service must allow obtaining character information regarding foreign individuals on a worldwide scale.<br />&bull; The service must allow the verification of the corporate ownership of entities, including parent corporations and subsidiaries, on a worldwide scale, with the ability to accurately distinguish between entities with common company names.<br />&bull; The service must have a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy searching.<br />&bull; The service must be supported by customer service representatives who can assist with performing searches, including crafting search criteria.<br />&bull; The information obtained through the service must be current, reliable, accessible via the internet, and comprehensive enough to provide MCC staff notice of alleged criminal activity, convictions, bankruptcies, regulatory violations, as well as association with criminals, terrorists, money launderers, human traffickers, and other individuals of high character risk or notoriety.<br />&bull; The service must provide for unlimited searching of relevant databases.</p>

However, this requirement is unrestricted, and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***<br /><br /><br />PURPOSE:<br /><br />The Magnetics Group requires a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance--(NMR) system upgrade. Currently, we use an antiquated hybrid (Bruker-Tecmag) NMR spectrometer console which is fundamentally limited by the electronics available at the time of its manufacture. A modern spectrometer would allow us to continue using our current NMR superconducting magnet, room temperature shims and probe, while simultaneously expanding our capabilities to include the use of magnetic field gradients for the purpose of diffusion measurements and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (specifically MRI microimaging). In addition, the improved electronics of a new spectrometer will better enable us to use our cryogen-free magnet for NMR and MRI, as well as opening up a range of NMR and MRI techniques currently unavailable due to the limitations of the current spectrometer. These capabilities are in line with the goals of the BioMagnetic Imaging Program within the Magnetics Group, which is actively working on diffusion phantoms for quantitative MRI standards, as well as complimenting efforts in NMR/MRI microcoil design. Because of our interest in quantitative measurements at clinical MRI field strengths (1.5, 3, and 7 tesla), it is important that a new console being able to function at these field strengths.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

   (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Firms are reminded that FAR 36.601-3(a), requires that perspective architect-engineers specify, in the construction design specifications, use of the maximum practical amount of recovered materials consistent with the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. Where appropriate the engineer must consider energy conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction to the maximum extent practical.
<p>EVALUATION and SELECTION CRITERIA: Submissions of completed Standard Forms 330 (SF-330) received in response to this notice will be evaluated by a government selection board in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks Act) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firms. Recent (within the past 5 years), relevant performance in preparing projects valued between $100,000 and $1,000,000 may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified. The primary factor for selection shall be the most qualified firm. The following is a detailed list of evaluation criteria.<br />(1) Professional Qualifications: Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance as demonstrated by education, experience, registration and management ability of personnel assigned to this contract and any applicable outside consultants. Availability of experienced key personnel, and consultants, and the number of years the consultants have worked with the firm. <br />(2) Specialized Experience: Technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials; specialized experience and technical competence of the team proposed for this project (including outside consultants) in related design areas of renovation, alteration, upgrading and repair of commercial, industrial and housing facilities. The effectiveness of the proposed project team (management structure and coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors) is also considered. <br />(3) Capacity: The firm's available capacity of key disciplines and experience with similar size projects is evaluated. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.<br />(4) Past Performance: Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. References and letters of commendation are also evaluated. List previous contracts and include the name and telephone number of the person who was the point of contact representing the Government or private industry contact. Government databases shall also be used.<br />(5) Location: Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; a 150-mile radius to Shaw Air Force Base located in Sumter, South Carolina is preferred. In selecting the most qualified firm, greater significance shall not be attributed to location.<br />(6) Prior Work Experience: Prior work experience to include contracts performed for city government, state government, federal agencies and Shaw AFB if applicable. <br />(7) CAD and Internet Capability: The firm's ability to produce engineering drawings on a CADD system and provide drawings to Shaw AFB that are fully compatible with Autodesk's AutoCAD computer assisted design and drafting software, version 2009 (or later). <br />(8) Cost Control Effectiveness: Demonstrate knowledge of design approaches, construction materials, codes/ordinances, costs, and other conditions unique to the geographic area covered by this contract. This includes evaluation of a firm's ability to accurately project construction costs of project designs within established cost parameters. <br />(9). Design Capability: This includes evaluation of a firm's description of their quality control processes and a description of the management approach the firm would use on the contract if they were the successful offeror.</p>
<p>(10). Volume of Work: The firm's available capacity to handle work. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.</p>

All information relating to the firms qualifications must be contained in the Standard Form. Inclusion by reference to other materials is not acceptable.

<DESC><p><strong>AMENDMENT 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>THESE ARE THE CHANGES, CORRECTIONS, QUESTIONS/ANSWERS &amp; UPDATES TO AMENDMENT 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) H901 PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS (APR 2002)<br />(f) Labor Categories</strong>:<br /><strong>Question:</strong> Software Engineer I listed two qualifications. Which one is the correct qualification?<br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The first qualification is correct<br />SOFTWARE ENGINEER 1 Qualifications is updated in the RFP document.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Pricing Matrix (Section J, Attachment 5 Revised)<br /></strong>(a) Labor Categories for the SAMPLE TASKs Updated<br />(b) Proposed Rate required only<br />(c) Projected rate Deleted and replaced with reserved</p>
<p>(3) Resumes do not count towards page limits. (Resumes for personnel will be submitted with Technical Volume). (Section L&amp;M updated)</p>
<p><strong>Section L:<br /></strong>Table 1.9 Proposal Organization, Vol. II updated to include resumes not counting towards page limits.<br />1.10.2 Updated - Resume<br />3.1 General - Technical - Updated Resume<br />3.2.2 Volume Organization Sub-factors updated</p>
<p><strong>Section M:<br /></strong>2.1 Technical Acceptability - Updated with SAMPLE Tasks evaluations</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION/ANSWER</strong></p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 1</strong>: Para 4.2 Pricing, indicates that all that is required from a pricing perspective is to provide the completed rate tables and price matrices associated with Attachments 3,4, and 5.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Offerors are to fulfill the requirements of Section L, para.4.2 by completing the RFP attachments 3, 4, and 5.<br /><br /><strong>Question 2:</strong> However, para 6.1.2 Section B - Supplies or Services and Costs/Prices, implies that a certain number of proposals are required. The wording: "The Offeror is required to provide standalone price proposals/information for each of the base year (basic 3 year plus 2 year options) and the four sample tasks that may be issued..." is confusing.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Also, Offerors are required to complete SF33 Section B - SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION 3:</strong> Is the Government asking for a proposal spreadsheet package with a summary page for the 3 base year period and 2 year option period program containing a total proposed price followed by spreadsheets for each base and option year, along with four separate stand alone spreadsheets for each Sample Task? <br />Our assumption is this would be backup for the para 4.2 requested Attachments 3,4, and 5.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: Yes.</strong> Also offerors are required to complete the inserts in section B and H of the RFP document.</p>

<DESC>Questions/Answers: *please notice the change in all CAPS below,&nbsp;to a question asked previously.<br /><br />Q: CLIN 0001 shows a U/I of "MO" and a Qty of "1". The labor costs associated with this CLIN are based on annual salaries and wages associated with our employees agreements. Should we change the QTY to 12 in the QTY column, which is 1/12 of the yearly labor costs. And accordingly, in the "Unit price/Cost" column reflect 1/12 of the cost for CLIN 0001?
<p>A: This is for an IDIQ, so the quantity is in increments of "1" and is to be priced as such. In addition a month means the total price to complete 1 month of CLIN 0001.</p>
<p>Q: As a follow-on to: Q: GFM does not include shelving, forklift, pallet jacks, or ladders/pickers. So do we assume that we price to provide such items along with the labor needed to move material from the incumbent's shelving/cabinets during transition if he will not sell those items, now in use at the warehouse, for industry standard price?<br />Gov't Answer: "Bidders need to price shelving, forklift, pallet jack, ladders etc. All equipment that contractor feels they would need to manage a warehouse. This equipment will become the property of the Air Force. Transportation costs for equipment shipped form current warehouse will be paid via the current contract. Once equipment arrives at new location it will be the awardees responsibility to unpack and maintain." <br />THIS IS NOT A CORRECT ANSWER. THE CORRECT ANSWER IS: ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIN 0001 CLS, MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE MONTHLY PRICE FOR CLS. <br /><br />Q: For warehousing support there will be reoccurring and non-reoccurring costs. Non-reoccurring costs being defined as those asset the contractor purchases at contract start-up to outfit the warehouse (shelving, forklift, pallet jack, ladders etc. All equipment that contractor feels they would need to manage a warehouse ). These assets will become government furnished property and will be added to the appropriate existing TDC GFP list. As "Other Direct Cost" (ODCs) should these costs be entered in CLIN 0004 and itemized in a new worksheet in the TEP worksheet?</p>
<p>A: The government is not requiring a warehouse; that is a business decision. All costs associated with CLIN 0001 must be included in the unit price for CLIN 0001. The government is not guaranteeing lease costs or even more than the minimum order. That is a business decision.</p>
<p>Q: Non-reoccurring costs would include primarily lease costs, utilities, and other monthly expenses to support the PWS warehouse operations. Should these "Other Direct Costs" (ODCs) also be entered in CLIN 0004 and itemized in a new worksheet in the TEP worksheet.</p>
<p>A: No, those are part of CLIN 0001 should you decide to provide a warehouse.<br />Q: For the non-recurring assets costs listed in the question above we will add those assets to the appropriate GFP list. Page 53 of the solicitation has a paragraph titled "GFP and/or Base Support Requirements"; which proposal volume would you like this information entered? Costs of the assets will be in Volume III, do you want the itemized list minus costs in Volume IV as well?</p>
<p>A: No, those will not be GFP; again all costs associated with CLIN 0001 must be priced at the CLIN level. If you think you need GFP, the contractor needs to identify in the appropriate paragraph of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Q: On page 52 of the solicitation, the instructions for Volume IV - Contract Documentation, states "The purpose of this volume is to provide information to the Government for preparing the contract document and supporting file. The offerors proposal shall include a copy of the completed model contract." Since instructions for Volume III state that cost information should not be included elsewhere in the proposal, should the contractor include a completed Section B and TEP worksheet in the model contract? Are we correct to assume that this model contract does not include sections L and M from the solicitation?</p>
<p>A: Yes, the completed Section B and TEP worksheet can be in the model contract. Yes, the model contract does not include Sections L&amp;M.<br /><br />Q: On page 52 of the solicitation, under the Volume IV - Contract Documentation section, paragraph labeled "Schedule A, and C through M" instructs offeror to read the entire RFP and complete all fill-ins.</p>
<p>a. Is the term "Schedule" interchangeable with the term "Section" in the solicitation when referring to sections of the contract or solicitation?</p>
<p>A: Yes<br /><br />b. We have read the entire RFP and all the amendments and we will state in Volume III that exceptions taken to the terms and conditions of the Solicitation. In our model contract in Volume IV we will fill in all fill-in sections of the solicitation which consists of Solicitation and model contract section K, section B, the TEP worksheet. Will this meet the requirements of this instruction or does the government want duplicate Schedule/Section A, and C through M place in Volume IV?</p>
<p>A: As long as ALL sections are included in the proposal, one copy will suffice. Simply indicate where the item can be located.</p>
<p>Q: Could the government identify what specifically they are requesting by "man-month to month conversation factors" required per page 52 "Basis of Estimate (BOE) instructions.</p>
<p>A: The government is requiring a unit price for the complete service month, not on a per person basis. The BOEs need to be in sufficient detail to track back to the unit price.</p>
<p>Q: Reference the DD-254 included with the RFP documents. Box 6, the solicitation number as well as the date do not match this solicitation. The document was sent as a PDF with the Contracting Officer's signature included. Please advise how the Government would like us to submit the DD-254 for this solicitation. Will an updated version be provided?</p>
<p>A: Box 6 of the DD254 will not be completed until the contract has been awarded. The DD254 tells the Contractor what type of clearance is required for this requirement. The Contractor needs to make sure they meet the clearance required for the solicitation. An updated version will be provided at time of award.</p>

<DESC><p>UPDATE 30 Mar 2011 - Presolicitation Notice</p>
<p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, intends to award a contract to procure program management, systems engineering and technical support to ensure continuity of effort and support the 50th Space Wing Plans and Programs Office (50 SW/XP) planning and programming personnel. The contract will be firm-fixed price (FFP) with a Base Period of 1 Sep 11 - 30 Sep 11 plus four (4) one-year option periods, each with a performance period from 1 Oct to 30 Sep of the respective option period. Option Period 1 will be exercised at time of contract award.</p>
<p>Services to be provided by this requirement include, but are not limited to the following: Mission Sustainment and Future Program Planning, Requirements Development and Integration of Mission Support Equipment, 50 SW Satellite and Command and Control (C2) Systems Integration, Wing Operational Requirements Development and Coordination, Wing Operational Plan Development, Wing Host/Tenant Base Planning and Integration, and Beddown, and Wing Compliance and Self-Inspection Program (SIP) Support. This requirement will provide scientific and engineering technical services to the 50 SW/XP. The 50 SW/XP Office is chartered to provide future planning to support the 50th Space Wing (50 SW) mission and for 50 SW bases and units and acts as the Wing's "front door" providing initial and continuing support to external agencies. The term "front door" means the 50 SW/XP office is the single point of entry, the only source, into the 50 SW for requests for any future planning support requirements. The 50 SW/XP also provides requirements validation, system integration and planning support for Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), satellite command and control systems and 50 SW users. The contractor shall provide support to all aspects of 50 SW/XP operations.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This synopsis is to make available a notice of proposed contract action as required by FAR 5.201. The government intends to issue a Request for Proposals, FA2550-11-R-8000, on or before 22 April 2011. This acquisition is set aside 100 percent for small business, with no specific subcategory targeted. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330 - Engineering Services, with a $27M size standard.</p>
<p>For planning purposes, a revised DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached. Interested potential offerors should note that major changes to the PWS include elimination of the requirement for a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), elimination of a requirement for GWAN/CWAN capabilities, and removal of Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development requirements. Interested potential offerors should review the entire PWS for other changes. Please note, this is a DRAFT PWS, and the Government reserves the right to make further changes. However, the Government is confident there will be no further significant changes prior to issuing the Request for Proposals.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program management office or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The Ombudsman can be reached at HQ AFSPC/A7K, 719-554-5250.</p>
<p><br />UPDATE 11 Mar 2011</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition planning process, an Initial Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Analysis has been conducted by the Contracting Officer. As a result of this analysis, the Government has identified several areas of the SORTIES requirement which could potentially be areas for OCI concerns. Attached is a "Memorandum for Potential Interested Offerors" dated 11 March 2011. Interested parties should review that memorandum. Although the final acquisition strategy has not yet been approved, the Contracting Officer intends to request that all offerors provide an OCI analysis and mitigation plan, to include the items discussed in the memorandum as part of their proposals. This memorandum is published for planning purposes only and IS NOT a request for proposal or a request for any other information from industry at this time.</p>

<p>Background &amp; Description <br />The EPS program is a follow-on to the operational Interim Polar System and will meet the communication needs of the user community above 65 deg North latitude. The EPS communications capability is based upon the Extended Data Rate (XDR) waveform, communications security, transmission security, and cryptology approaches. EPS mission control and mission planning will be independent of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system while EPS key management will interface with the AEHF Key Management Architecture (KMA). <br />This Request for Information (RFI) by the USAF Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Directorate seeks industry feedback on capabilities for the following approaches: <br />1. Develop an architecture and prototype ground segment for the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) and transition these products to an operational system post milestone B (assuming 3Q FY12 Authority to Proceed (ATP));</p>
<p>2. Provide Approach 1 above, plus discuss the capabilities for EPS System Engineering, Integration, and Test (SEIT) activities.</p>
<p>The Government would appreciate feedback on the feasibility of coupling EPS ground segment development with EPS system level SEIT functions currently performed by the Government.<br />Functions of the EPS ground segment are:<br />1. Telemetry and Command <br />2. Communications Planning <br />3. Simulator, Test, and Training<br />4. Support, Operations, and Maintenance</p>
<p>Functions of the EPS system level SEIT task are:<br />1. System Engineering process development and execution <br />2. Requirements, Analysis and Verification <br />3. Interface Management <br />4. Integration and Test <br />5. Information Assurance<br />Objectives</p>
<p>Objectives of this RFI include the following: <br />1. Gather information from industry on capabilities for a potential acquisition of an EPS ground segment.<br />2. Identify industry capabilities to meet draft ground segment requirements, specifically areas that affect cost, risk, and schedule.<br />3. Gather information from industry on capabilities to perform EPS SEIT functions in conjunction with ground segment development.<br />4. Support preliminary acquisition documentation and strategy development for a potential acquisition.<br />5. Gather information to support budgetary planning.</p>
<p>Responses <br />This section contains all information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. SMC appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources that contain the following content and format. <br />&bull; Content:<br />Statement of Capabilities:<br />o Experience in developing MILSATCOM EHF Command and Control systems based upon SMC specifications and standards<br />o Experience in developing MILSATCOM Mission Planning Systems based upon XDR waveforms<br />o Experience in developing and modifying communications security, transmission security and cryptology approaches compatible with AEHF Key Management Architecture <br />o Capability to develop a Command and Control and Mission Planning prototype that demonstrates critical functionality <br />o Capability for transitioning a pre milestone B prototype to a post milestone B operational system<br />o Capability to develop Interface Control Documents and conduct system and segment testing and verification<br />o Capability to support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) no later than 2Q FY17<br />o Experience and capability to provide EPS SEIT support as described in this RFI<br />o Capability to support handling of material up to TS/SCI and provide personnel with access up to TS/SCI</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources with innovative approaches, designs, or products for a new replacement radar on the AH-64D Apache helicopter.  The AH-64 is the U.S. Army's primary attack helicopter and is designed to fight during the day, night, and in adverse weather.  The AH-64 can be armed with 16 HELLFIRE missiles, a 30mm M230 chain gun, and/or 76 2.75 inch folding fin rockets.  The U.S. Army is close to completing development of new hardware for the current Fire Control Radar (FCR) that is mounted on the main rotor mast above the rotors.  This new FCR hardware will enhance the detection capabilities of the AH-64 as well as reduce the logistical burden, operations and sustainment costs, eliminate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability over the current FCR.  Even with these new updates, a new radar is envisioned with additional design updates and capabilities to assist the AH-64 in effectively operating in previous, current, and emerging theaters of operation.<br><br>REQUIREMENTS:  The new radar concept must have an open-systems architecture and be compatible with AH-64D Block I, II, and III aircraft.   Capabilities desired include all weather operation for detection, targeting, tracking, and situational awareness in air, land, and sea environments.   The radar must effectively operate in a high clutter environment simultaneously tracking multiple targets both moving and stationary at varying ranges and Radar Cross Section (RCS) size.  The envisioned target set for this radar will include armored tracked/wheeled vehicles, air defense systems, commercially acquired light trucks/cars, air targets including Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), dismounted personnel, and maritime targets.  Technology and/or systems that provide 360 degree situational awareness and targeting capability, intuitive and/or easy to use displays, no moving parts, light weight, low Radar Cross Section, and aerodynamic improvements over the current FCR are highly desired.  Additionally, it's desired that the radar be capable of supporting radar imagery and target data integration with off platform sensor (UAS), and onboard electro optical sensor imagery to rapidly achieve a fully integrated targeting and situational awareness display to the pilot.  Already proven packages are preferred that will support a two level maintenance concept.  The design/concept must be able to endure in a high vibration environment, meet Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) requirements and not interfere with the aircraft safety, adversely affect aircraft weight and balance limitations nor interfere with existing systems.  <br><br>The U.S. Army seeks qualified vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, reliability data including Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Additionally, the U.S. Army is seeking sources with a strong background, history, and/or past performance in streamlining and facilitating rapid acquisition, addressing obsolescence, enhancing USG-contractor interactions, and containing costs with comprehensive cost controls.  Innovative ideas and solutions are strongly encouraged especially regarding testing and use of modeling and simulation during system development.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiated evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above.  <br><br>All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest, qualifications, and technical concepts to the Contracting Officer, Nicole Sullivan-Williams, (256) 313-4237, e-mail address is nicole.sullivan-williams@peoavn.army.mil.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Suspense is 150 days after synopsis.<br>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0939<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Front Closure, Orange w/ Yellow Trim, Universal Size<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, front closure, orange with yellow trim, one-size-fits all or universal size</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0940<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 2, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Universal Size<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 2, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim , one-size-fits all or universal size.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0957<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Medium<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size medium.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0958<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, Large<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim , size large.</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0959<br />Name: Vest, Safety, ANSI Class 3, Front Closure, Yellow/Lime w/ Silver Trim, XLarge<br />Description: Safety Vest, ANSI 107 Compliant, Class 3, front closure, yellow/lime with silver trim, size extra large.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0939<br />Similar Items: 97591-(M-4XL)</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0940<br />Similar Items: 97591-(M-4XL)</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0957<br />Similar Items: 3079-00024, 86540</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0958<br />Similar Items: 3079-00023, 86540</p>
<p>NSN: 8415-00-NIB-0959<br />Similar Items: 3079-00024, 86540</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 13, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

The FAA, William J Hughes Technical Center intends to award a single source contract to UNICOR.
The furniture is currently being used by the FAA to support their requirements and therefore unable to obtain through any other known source.
UNICOR brings the following essential data experience:
-	UNICOR products are compatible and offer interchangeability with existing standardized furniture components in use at the WJHTC. -	Furniture components from another source would not afford ability to integrate, repair, and reconfigure the office space in a cost effective and efficient manner.

<DESC><p>The following notice is an UNCLASSIFIED Request for Information.</p>
<p>This Global Positioning System (GPS) Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) Reference Document provides a source of GPS DAE design criteria reflecting PMA-213 and PMW/A-170 envisioned implementation objectives. As such, this document is not contractually binding. It is expected that any future contract awardee(s) will expand upon the reference requirements provided herein to develop a DAE Specification Document suitable to develop a digital GPS antenna electronics system capable of meeting the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Guidance Quality (GQ) requirements. It is further expected that JPALS GPS DAE working group will expand upon this reference document and mature it into a Performance Specification in preparation for fielding a GPS DAE system(s) as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) for JPALS targeted platforms.</p>
<p>The GPS DAE is a Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) and a component of the JPALS Aircraft Navigation Sensor (JANS). JANS is capable of receiving NavStar GPS satellite signals and providing precise position information necessary for precision approach and landing on JPALS equipped fixed wing and rotary aircraft in both benign and jamming environments. JANS consists of a GPS receiver and a GPS Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) with associated Antenna Electronics (AE).</p>
<p>PMA-213 and PMW/A-170 formed a JPALS GPS DAE working group with GPS subject matter experts from PMA-213, PMW/A-170, AIR-4.5.5, and the GPS Directorate to develop a performance specification for a GPS DAE system that will meet JPALS GQ requirements. This document is a culmination of the JPALS GPS DAE working group and was written as a Reference Document for industry to capture an early assessment of expected performance requirements for a JPALS GPS DAE subsystem.<br /><br />PMW/A-170 is leading an effort for PMA-213 to acquire a Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Antenna Electronics (AE) system capable of performing the digital beamforming (beam steering and nulling) function required to meet the JPALS accuracy, availability, continuity and integrity Guidance Quality (GQ) requirements in a Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming environment. In order to met JPALS GQ requirements, DoD must develop and integrate the next generation of AE systems, such as digital beamforming AEs, that minimize biases on the GPA measurements in a jamming environment.</p>
<p><br />This is not a request for proposal or an indication that the JPALS Program Office or NAVAIR will contract for the items contained in this Request for Information. NAVAIR will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Interested companies should review that attached white paper for more details regarding the Digital Beamforming Antenna Electronics for JPALS.<br />The technical point of contact for this RFI is Kim Wayland. The Government would like industry to provide information on what solutions are currently available or in development to the issue above. Please submit via email to kimberly.wayland@navy.mil or hardcopy to:</p>

<DESC>Fire Pump Code Compliance Additional questions:
Question  1.  On the new 8" water lateral, is the intention to bury a valve at the tapping sleeve in the "on" position, or to have no valve until the P.I.V.?
Answer 1:  The intent was that new line would be valved at new PIV. All valves on fire laterals have to be accessible and monitored by fire alarm.
Question  2.  On the 6" existing water lateral, is the intention to bury the existing valve in the "closed" position, or to remove everything back to the 16" main?
Answer 2.  The intent on existing is that it would be removed and capped back at main.
Question 3.  Do you have a written phasing plan?  I cannot find one on the drawings.  I can find the work associated with Phase 1, 2 (partial), 3, 5 and 6.  But cannot find what is in phase 2(partial) and 4.  Can you provide direction?
Answer 3: Refer to suggested phasing narrative on sheet FP001. Contractor is to verify all phasing and any changes with VA.

Question 4.  There is a note on the drawings that state no Med Air shutdowns will be allowed.  Is this correct?  How can you remove and relocated the required Med Air without  a shutdown?  I assume the re-certification of the med air system after a shutdown will be required and will be the contractors' responsibility?  Please advise.
Answer 4:  Med Gas Piping on sheet P100: 1-1/2" MA is line to SCI building (which is not active? - VA to verify) so it should not require shutdown. 2" OX is for emergency backup connection and again should not require any shutdown. The intent of the MA dryer was to support from ceiling during construction of new mezzanine and then support on new mezzanine when complete. Again, intent was to avoid shut downs.  That being said if contractor feels shutdown will be necessary the contractor shall cover all re-certification of systems and shall coordinate and qualify this requirement with VA in bid.

This contract requires that Jarzombek Research, Inc. continue to provide Research Assistant services on the project.

4.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition

5.	A statement demonstrating the unique qualifications of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority.

The specifications of the work and the requisite skills needed to successfully accomplish the goals of the contract are of such a nature that few individuals possess them.  

The contractor, Jarzombek Research, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide these services to Dr. Linda Resnik (Study PI) at the Providence VAMC based upon the following:

a.	The contractor has been working with Dr. Linda Resnik in the capacity of Research Assistant at the CFI since October 2008.

The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition will be posted to FBO. It is not clear whether a need for similar resources will be required by Dr. Resnik in the near future. 

7.	The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition, including options if applicable, and a determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

The requirements cannot be modified to enhance competition, as they are determined as a result of an IRB approved protocol and are in line with the project as approved by VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Program Officer (Robert Jaeger, PhD).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
   
Upon the basis of the following facts other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is approved.  

Identification Number (purchase request/solicitation number) 650-11-1-886-001, as amended. 


1.	Identification of the agency, contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a justification for other than full and open competition.
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Contracting Office at Providence VAMC, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for Research Consulting Services in fulfillment of the referenced requirement of the Research and Education (152) Service.

2.	The nature and/or description of the action being approved, i.e., sole source, limited competition, establishment of a new source, etc.

Contracting Action: A new, sole source, labor hour, Research Services contract with Shana L. Klinger, MA.

3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.
The requirement is to provide consulting services for the VA protocol "VA Study to Optimize the DEKA Arm" at Providence VAMC at a total cost of $69,600. This project is a Service Directed Research Project sponsored by the VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Service. 
This contract requires that Ms. Klinger continue to serve as a consulting Qualitative Data Analyst on the project.

4.	The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition
is 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

5.	A statement demonstrating the unique qualifications of the proposed contractor or the nature of the action requiring the use of the authority.

The specifications of the work and the requisite skills needed to successfully accomplish the goals of the contract are of such a nature that few individuals possess them.  

Shana Klinger, MA is uniquely qualified to provide these services to Dr. Linda Resnik (Study PI) at the Providence VAMC based upon the following:

a.	She has been working on the DEKA Arm project since March of 2009 (via contracts with Ocean State Research Institute and the VA).
b.	She has familiarity of prior iterations of the DEKA Arm.
c.	She has familiarity with the technological and usability issues associated with the DEKA Arm, which is prerequisite knowledge to perform the data analysis.
d.	She has co-authored publications with Dr. Resnik related to the field of devices and prosthetics.
e.	She is experienced in the use of the qualitative software (NVIVO) used for this project.
f.	She has over 10 years of experience in the field of qualitative data analysis.
g.	She has over 15 years of writing experience and the ability to make technical concepts understandable to a wide range of readers.

6.	A description of efforts to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. Include whether or not a FedBizOps announcement was made and what response, if any, was received, or include the exception under FAR 5.202 if not synopsizing. Describe whether any additional or similar requirements are anticipated in the future (this may not be included as an addendum, but must be in the body of the JOFOC).

The acquisition will be synopsized to FedBizOps, the Government Point of Entry. (GPE).


7.	The anticipated dollar value of the proposed acquisition, including options if applicable, and a determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated price(s) will be fair and reasonable based on the following:

The proposed rate is competitive with the rate for experienced research/healthcare data analysts. As a burdened rate (inclusive of General and Administrative (G&A) and indirect costs) the hourly rate of $65/hour is comparable to rates in the Boston Statistical Metropolitan Area (SMA) for a comparable data analyst in the 0101 Social Science Analyst Series.

The contract comprises a base and two (2) one-year option periods with a total value of $208,800.00

8.	A description of the market research conducted and the results. 
The hourly rate determined is competitive with Ms. Klinger's contracted rates with the Commonwealth Fund and the State of RI Department of Health. At the time that the initial contract with Ms. Klinger was initiated, we also conducted an informal survey of colleagues at Brown University who utilized external analysts in their research projects to determine whether the proposed rate was in keeping with the market. Based based on this information we believed that the rate was reasonable and appropriate.  


9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
The work to be performed as part of this contract is not suitable for full and open competition because Dr. Resnik, as the responsible Principal Investigator, needs to be confident that the contractor is capable of the qualitative analysis of the therapeutic measures involved in this study.   In addition, the project is under a strict time constraint, limited by a contract involving DARPA.

The requirements cannot be modified to enhance competition, as they are determined as a result of an IRB approved protocol and are in line with the project as approved by VA Central Office Rehabilitation Research and Development Program Officer (Robert Jaeger, PhD). 

10.	A listing of any sources that expressed a written interest in the acquisition.

 None.

11.	A statement of any actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition, if subsequent acquisitions are anticipated.

 VA Rehabilitation Research and Development (RR&D) Service and the Principal Investigator continue to monitor requirements and developments in the market for these services.
