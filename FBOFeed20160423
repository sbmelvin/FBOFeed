<p>- 3 -<br />(vi) Description of Requirements:<br />Recent floods along the Mississippi River Floodplain have left large areas damaged from scouring, flooding, and sand deposition within the WRP Easements on Sheep's Ridge. NRCS is attempting to establish trees in these locations. It is imperative that the NRCS establish cover on the soil surface on these easements to protect from future scouring via flooding and to provide cover to reduce weed populations. NRCS is partnering with the USACE to protect this area as it was severely damaged by the 2011 flood event. USACE shear stress models suggest that the long-term success of their works of improvement rely heavily on NRCS restoring vegetation to these areas.<br />NRCS is seeking a commercial applicator to apply multi-species cover crops to the four (4) areas shown on the map. Recent floods have left these areas nearly impossible to plat via traditional methods (tractor and planter). NRCS will provide projected shapefiles in addition to the maps if it will assist the applicator.
