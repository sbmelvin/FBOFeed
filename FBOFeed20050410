<DESC>The US Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS)-GovWorks, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.   MMS intends to make a sole source award to Multi Service Corporation for the US Army Program Management (Army PMO).  This requirement is to provide financial management support for the Army PMO.  Army PMO is required to use the Army Petroleum Center as a mandatory source for aviation fuel to be used by Army aircraft when away from their garrisons.  The Army Petroleum Center has outsourced their financial management of this requirement to Multi Service Corporation which uses credit cards as a payment service in order to pay for fuel used by the Army PMO.  Army PMO uses GovWorks for contracting and financial support in order to pay Multi Service Corporation for their credit card services in paying for the fuel used by Army PMO. The total value of this order is estimated to be $3.1 million, including two option periods.   This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.   However, all information received by Close of Business 25 April 2005, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>99--Payment of Credit Card Service
<DESC>This amendment is being issued on tthe presolicitation notice for 0405RQ42547.  This amendment is being issued because this notice was inadvertently issued as a presolicitation notice and was intended to be issued as a special notice.  The US Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS)-GovWorks, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.   MMS intends to make a sole source award to Multi Service Corporation for the US Army Program Management (Army PMO).  This requirement is to provide financial management support for the Army PMO.  Army PMO is required to use the Army Petroleum Center as a mandatory source for aviation fuel to be used by Army aircraft when away from their garrisons.  The Army Petroleum Center has outsourced their financial management of this requirement to Multi Service Corporation which uses credit cards as a payment service in order to pay for fuel used by the Army PMO.  Army PMO uses GovWorks for contracting and financial support in order to pay Multi Service Corporation for their credit card services in paying for the fuel used by Army PMO. The total value of this order is estimated to be $3.1 million, including two option periods.   This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.   However, all information received by Close of Business 25 April 2005, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
