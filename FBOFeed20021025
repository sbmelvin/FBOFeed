<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Urban Logic. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, Federal Geographic Data Committee. This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The U.S. Geological Survey, Director's Office, Geographic Information Office, Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) requests award of a non-competitive procurement to Urban Logic Inc, a not for profit organization, for a continuation of work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the FGDC to implement actions in support of the OMB Information Initiative "Collecting Information in the Information Age". As a result of the July 18, 2000, OMB-Geospatial Information Roundtable, OMB determined that significant public benefit could be gained from initiating a series of actions to accelerate the implementation of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). Under the leadership of the OMB Office of Information Resources Management, the FGDC and its Federal agency members began a renewed series of partnership building activities to overcome some of the most significant barriers to NSDI implementation. Of particular interest is the establishment of a Financing Solutions Team to look at opportunities for new approaches that will aid the implementation of the NSDI. Key elements of the initiative are: 1. Partnerships among State, local, tribal, and Federal authorities, and the private sector could help share costs by capturing economies of scale and aligning their pooled capital investments in standardized spatial data layers and content. 2. Mechanisms for allocating and sharing data collections and costs efficiently effectively and fairly would encourage data development and stewardship at the right place by the right organization. All investors in spatial infrastructure should use common criteria when investing in spatial infrastructure. Criteria would include Federal and market standards for interoperability, data format, and metadata and content standards, along with principles for public access, data security, privacy and other goals affecting governmental and business data. 3. Creative financing outside of government appropriation cycles, such as infrastructure bonds or other financial products, could supplement and de-politicize the funding process, providing the liquidity to deploy and sustain shared spatial infrastructure. Phase 2 of the OMB GeoSpatial information Implementation Initiative: Supporting Financing Solutions and the GoeSpatial One Stop, Implementing a Coherent National Development and Financing Strategy for Spatial Information Collection, Distribution and Use. This is a follow-on to Cooperative Agreement 01 HQAG0026. The Office of Acquisition and Grants has determined the need to make a follow-on contract instead of a cooperative agreement. Urban Logic, Inc. has been involved with National Partnership for Reinventing Government, OMB and others in leading discussions about financing NSDI at all levels of government using approaches that have been used in other sectors but not in the geospatial data arena. Urban Logic has demonstrated a commitment to the principles and practices of the NSDI and to the development of a variety of public and private financing mechanisms that follow its public policy requirements. Urban Logic brings experience and expertise in areas such as financial markets, investment criteria and business case development that are not available in the FGDC or its member agencies. Urban Logic is also well positioned to work with FGDC and OMB in identifying a securing the participation of a wide range of the economic, financial and investment community in the Financial Solutions Team. A close working relationship exists between FGDC and Urban Logic and is required in order to ensure that federal policy positions are clear and that OMB and other key participants are thoroughly involved in the project as it is implemented. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by October 31, 2002. This date will not be extended. All expressions of interest shall be faxed to 703-787-1836 or e-mailed to anna.brown@mms.gov <mailto:anna.brown@mms.gov>  to be considered by the Government. Phone calls will neither be accepted nor acknowledged. This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SOLNBR>70371
<RESPDATE>111202
<ARCHDATE>12302002
<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>GovWorks is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the Office of Historical Trust Accounting, U.S. Department of the Interior. This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; OFFERS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Contract period is for a base period of one year with two option years. The Government reserves the right to make more than one award from this solicitation. The Government also reserves the right to unilaterally extend the period of contract performance in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract--Services". STATEMENT OF WORK: Objective: Support, research, analysis, and documentation of the history of the organizations and management of the IIM trust fund provided to the Office of Historical Trust Accounting and Departmental leadership in planning and implementing the historical accounting. BACKGROUND: The Department of the Interior (Interior) has the fiduciary responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government to manage both Tribal trust funds and Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust funds. These two trust funds and accounts are managed by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians (OST). The Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) was established to plan for and direct the historical accounting of IIM accounts. On July 2, 2002, OHTA submitted the Report to Congress on the Historical Accounting of Individual Indian Money Accounts (Report to Congress) available on OHTA's website at http://www.doi.gov/ohta/revreport.pdf.   On June 27, 2002, OHTA's responsibilities were enlarged to include accounting for Tribal trust funds. OHTA is developing a plan for how it will conduct the historical accounting of tribal trust funds. Other documents prepared by OHTA include the September 10, 2001, Blueprint for Developing the Comprehensive Historical Accounting Plan for the Individual Indian Money Accounts, a framework for preparing the Report to Congress, the November 7, 2001, Report Identifying Preliminary Work for the Historical Accounting. (Both documents are available on the OHTA website at http://www.doi.gov/ohta/documents.html) The OST, established by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 (PL. 103-412), was created to improve the accountability and management of Indian funds held in trust by the Federal Government. Currently, OST maintains approximately 1,400 accounts for 315 Tribal entities with cash and investments of approximately $3.0 billion, and more than 285,000 IIM accounts with cash and investments of approximately $360 million. Annually, approximately $800 million passes through the Tribal trust fund, and approximately $300 million passes through the IIM trust fund. This income is generated from the sale or rental of Indian-owned land and uses of natural resources such as timber, farming, grazing, and royalties from various minerals and oil and gas exploration and production, and from land use for rights-of-way and easements.  Funds also are derived from interest earned on invested funds, as well as awards or settlements of Tribal or individual Indian claims. The BIA, along with Interior's Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management, manage the land records, and revenue collection and processing.     Cobell v. Norton Although U.S. policy through the 1870s was to locate Indians on reservations, the government began to break up reservations starting in the 1880s. Thousands of individual Indians were given tracts of land during the allotment era. The government held these tracts in trust, and later established an Individual Indian Monies system to collect and disburse to the Indians any revenues generated by mining, oil and gas extraction, timber operations, grazing or similar activities on their land. In June 1996, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Department by five Indian plaintiffs on behalf of Individual Indian Money (IIM) account holders which asked for, in part, the historical accounting of IIM accounts. On December 21, 1999, the U.S. District Court ruled that the Department was in breach of four specific duties.  On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the ruling of the District Court; however, it stated that the actual legal breach was the failure to provide an accounting. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling provides some guidance on the obligation of the Department to perform an accounting of the IIM accounts. Specifically, the Court of Appeals held that the relationship between the United States and the IIM account holders is a trust relationship that creates fiduciary obligations. See Cobell v. Norton, 240 F.3d 1081, 1099-1100 (D.C. Cir. 2001). In addition, the Court of Appeals held that, while the government's obligations are rooted in and outlined by relevant statutes and treaties, they are largely defined in traditional equitable terms.   "Where Congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law, a court must infer, unless the statute otherwise dictates, that Congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms."  Courts "must infer that Congress intended to impose on trustees traditional fiduciary duties unless Congress has unequivocally expressed an intent to the contrary."  Id. Much as the Supreme Court has regularly turned to the Restatement and other authorities to construe trust responsibilities, it is appropriate for the District Court to consult similar sources. Because of this, the Court of Appeals held that the United States owes a duty to account to the IIM beneficiaries. The Court of Appeals also held that the "1994 Act reaffirms the government's preexisting fiduciary duty to perform a complete historical accounting of trust fund assets," and found that the fair and accurate accounting referenced in Section 102 of the 1994 Act requires "reconciling the accounts, taking into account past deposits, withdrawals, and accruals," as well as reporting of "all items of property, income, and expenses. . . ." Id. at 1102-03.  The Court of Appeals further stated that an "adequate" accounting is one that is "sufficient to serve the purposes for which a trust accounting is typically conducted."  Id. at 1103.  Therefore, the accounting "must contain sufficient information for the beneficiary readily to ascertain whether the trust has been faithfully carried out." Id.   The Court of Appeals, however, acknowledged that there were substantial questions yet to be determined about the scope of the accounting owed by the United States. The Court of Appeals expressly stated that the decisions regarding the nature and scope of the United States' accounting were to be resolved by the Federal Government. Thus, while noting that the Department's actions would be judged by strict standards based upon the duty to deal fairly with the IIM beneficiaries, the Court of Appeals noted with approval that the District Court had "explicitly left open the choice of how the accounting would be conducted, whether certain accounting methods, such as statistical sampling or something else, would be appropriate.  Such decisions are properly left in the hands of administrative agencies."  Id. at 1104.   It is within this context that the Department will design its approach and conduct the historical accounting using appropriate methods to fulfill its trust responsibility.  Historical Accounting Project As part of Interior's overall trust reform efforts, Interior is undertaking an evaluation of the reliability of past IIM and Tribal account activity. In her Secretarial Order and memorandum of July 10, 2001, Secretary Gale Norton established the OHTA and charged the OHTA with planning and carrying out this historical accounting.  Given the length of time involved, the distinct histories of various groups of trust assets, the various business practices that generated trust income, the sheer volume of records and known or suspected problems in the records, and other historical factors, the historical accounting is expected to be a monumental, complicated task.  The Report to Congress on IIM historical accounting identified an effort that would take at least 10 years and cost approximately $2.4 billion.  No plan has been developed for the Tribal accountings and the expected time and cost for this work has not been estimated yet. OHTA has identified key documents that will be required for the historical accounting in its Accounting Standards Manual.  The documents vary according to the type of trust income or other account transaction.  The income sources and other account activity that need to be documented include interest distributions, disbursements, funds transfers, judgments, oil and gas leases, other mineral leases, business and recreational leases, surfaces leases, timber sales, probates of estates, per capita payments, land sales, entitlement income, and miscellaneous land uses.   Nature of the Contract This contract is intended to provide the Department, OHTA and its contractors with independent historical knowledge, research expertise, and advice concerning the history of allotment of Indian lands, the history of economic activity on allotted lands, Tribal histories as they relate to allotted lands and IIM funds, the history of the IIM trust fund, the evolution of the BIA in managing IIM accounts, and knowledge of the various sources of records relating to the aforementioned histories.  The information developed under this contract will be a critical part of the historical accountings and will help in developing cost effective records searches informed by a knowledge of the history of geographic areas and/or groups of accounts.   Duration:   This contract initially for $250,000 is envisioned to continue for the duration of the historical accounting project described above. Location:   It is anticipated that the contractor will be available for periodic meetings at its offices, at the OHTA offices or at the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, or at sites around the United States. Meeting frequency is expected to average about once a month. Tasks and Deliverables OHTA has identified the long-term role of historical experts in its Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) work plan under Tasks 1.5.1 through 1.5.1.  The contractor(s) will be responsible for the following tasks and deliverables: 1.  Reservation Histories The contractor(s) will research the history of allotments and resource development on approximately 200 reservations or other BIA jurisdictions and prepare brief tribal/reservation history reports (reservation histories) on each.  The reservation histories will have two purposes: *	To inform the process of collecting documentation for the historical accounting.   *	To provide a framework for reporting to the beneficiaries and BIA staff.  The reservation histories will contain the following items: ·	Changes in the name of the reservation through history and current address ·	Changes in agency or area office or regional office that affected the reservation ·	Location of records in the National Archives ·	Major treaties/legislation (including the allotment act pursuant to that reservation) ·	Process of allotment (a short historical narrative) ·	Resource development (a short historical narrative) ·	Judgment funds and other IIM revenue if applicable ·	Maps and illustrations ·	Brief bibliography ·	Such other information as may be requested by OHTA Deliverable: Reservation history reports, schedule for, the scope and detail of which will be determined by OHTA 2.  Document Identification and Collection The contractor(s) will conduct document identification and collection in the Office of Trust Records (Albuquerque); the regional facilities of the National Archives and Records Administration, including the Federal Records Center located at Lee's Summit, Missouri; BIA offices and any other records repositories.  Other contractors will be involved in this process, too, and the precise role of the history contractor(s) remains to be determined. Both the reservation histories and the Accounting Standards Manual will be used in making the document collection as consistent and complete as possible. Deliverable: Inventories of documents and accessions as maintained at records facilities, as requested by OHTA 3.  Assistance in Accounting After documents are identified, collected, imaged and coded, the accountants on the historical accounting team will perform the actual accounting for each IIM account.  The history contractor(s) will provide assistance as needed during this process.  For example, historical knowledge may provide guidance for dealing appropriately with gaps in the document record. Deliverable: To be defined. 4.  Outreach An important aspect of OHTA's mission is to report to the IIM beneficiaries in such a way that the beneficiaries can determine for themselves whether the historical accounting has been faithfully performed.  The unique history of each reservation, particularly with regard to how the reservation was allotted and how the resources were developed, will form a vital part of that reporting.  OHTA may require revision and/or submission of the reservation histories for publication on OHTA's website in conjunction with summary findings from the historical accounting.  OHTA may also require the history contractor(s) to participate in public presentations, providing historical context in accountings. Deliverable: Website ready reports in a PDF or other format as specified by OHTA. 5.  Other Work as Needed OHTA will require historical research and reporting on other issues. Examples of issues that have arisen and require historical expertise are as follows: *	History of Judgment Awards.  Many tribes have received judgment wards for claims against the United States, and some of these judgment awards have been distributed on a per capita basis to IIM accounts.  OHTA needs a comprehensive understanding of where and when these occurred. *	History of Records Destruction.  OHTA has obtained a history of records disposition, and it is already informed of anecdotal cases of records description under approved federal records retention schedules. However, OHTA needs a systematic investigate of all instances of records destruction.  OHTA may require that history contractor(s) to develop an approach to such an inquiry and to be prepared to research and report on certain aspects of BIA records disposal if not the entire history of it. *	Assistance with Historical Accounting for Tribes.   As noted above, OHTA is charged with planning and carrying out historical accountings for tribes as well as IIM beneficiaries.  The history contractor(s) may be involved in the planning phases of this effort and/or tasks analogous to those described above for the historical accounting of IIM accounts. Deliverables: Reports on topics and of such scope as directed by OHTA. HOW TO PROPOSE: Offers must submit brief written proposals NOT EXCEEDING Fifteen (15) pages in length.

<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager - Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for an Extraction Parachute Jettison System (EPJS) Heavy to augment the existing EPJS-Light.  EPJS-Light can jettison 15-foot, 22-foot, and singl e 28-foot extraction parachutes.  An EPJS-Heavy is required for jettisoning clusters of two and three 28-foot extraction parachutes, and it must be interoperable with the EPJS-Light.  Performance requirements and verification methods are described in the E PJS-Heavy Purchase Description document available in the Soldier Systems Center's website.  Emphasis will be placed on safe control of jettisoned components.  For informational purposes only and to obtain the latest information regarding the EPJS-Heavy bef ore the RFP release, please go to Soldier Systems Center’s web site at https://www3.natick.army.mil/under Business Opportunities/UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS/DAAD16-03-R-0004/Files Available for Download.  Purchase Description, background information, and drawing s are available for download. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ under Business Opportunities/Ongoing Acquisitions/DAAD16-03-R-0004 on or about 15 October 2002. NO h ardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Ms. Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army.mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998. Firms will not be reimbursed for any  costs associated with proposal preparation. Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: A RFP will be issued and offerors' proposals will be evaluated to determine the item's ability to meet the requirements stated in  the EPJS-Heavy Purchase Description. A competitive range will be established, and offerors of proposals that fall within the range and have systems or system components available for purchase may be issued purchase orders for systems or components to be t ested and evaluated. If systems or components are available, one extraction parachute jettison device and the means to activate it at least three times must be ready for testing 90 days after issuance of purchase order. Offerors will be required to provide  repair and training support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order. These hardware items will be subjected to a limited test and evaluation but will not be flight t ested. Based upon the proposals review and results of any test and evaluation of purchased hardware items, a single contract will then be awarded to the successful offeror to include a System Development and Design Validation Base Effort, an option for Des ign Refinement and Testing, an option for Operational Testing, an option for Production Drawings, and options for production. The Base Effort will include CLINs for test items, engineering, and testing support. The Base Effort will require 2 complete EPJ S-Heavy systems and be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFP) type contract. Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to airdrop testing. An option (CPFF) to refine the design and manufacture 10 EPJS-Heavy test articl es may be exercised and the items subjected to Development Testing (DT) to determine if they satisfy all performance requirements. This option will include CLINs for test items, engineering, and testing support.  Upon successful completion of DT an option( CPFF) to reconfigure any non-conforming hardware to production configuration may be exercised.  This option would include preparing and conducting Operational Tester training and Instructor and Key Personnel training, and preparing technical manual changes  and provisioning data.  If Operational Test is successful and the Army decides to acquire and field the EPJS-Heavy, a production option - Firm Fixed Price (FFP ) may be exercised to meet the Army's estimated fielding requirements of approximately 250 EPJS-Heavy systems. Another FFP option to acquire production drawings may also be exercised.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336 413.  This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis.  NOTE: This synopsis was previously announced under solicitation number DAAD16-02-R-0035, which now has been changed to DAAD16-03-R-0004.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is soliciting comments on its proposed approach to phase II of a cost-shared, public-private project to develop cost effective large wind turbine (greater than 100 kilowatt) technology for low wind speed resource sites throughout the United States.  Background:  Current cost of energy (COE) levels for wind energy have been achieved by focusing development on Class 6 wind resource sites (average wind speeds of 6.7 m/s @10 m height) and by taking advantage of the production tax credit (1.7 cents/kWh in 2002 dollars).  With favorable financial terms, such Class 6 sites can market electricity at prices of 4 cents/kWh or less, before the subsidy.  However, as more and more sites are developed, easily accessible prime class 6 sites are disappearing.  In addition, many class 6 sites are located in remote areas that do not have easy access to transmission lines.  The full development of accessible class 6 sites may cause wind energy growth to plateau in the near future unless improvements in technology can make lower wind speed sites more cost effective.  Class 4 wind sites (5.8 m/s @10 m) cover vast areas of the great plains from central and northern Texas to the Canadian border.  Class 4 sites are also found along many coastal areas and along the shores of the great lakes.  While the average distance of class 6 sites from major load centers is 500 miles, Class 4 sites are significantly closer, with an average distance of 100 miles from the load centers. Thus, utility access to the class 4 sites is more attractive and less costly.  Also, class 4 sites represent almost 20 times the developable wind resource of class 6 sites.  Currently wind energy at class 4 sites can be marketed at prices in the range of 5 to 6 cents/kWh.  Low Wind Speed Technology (LWST) Goal and Strategy:  The Federal Wind Energy program has defined goals for its technology development activities that will position wind as an attractive advanced technology option for the twenty-first century.  The LWST goal is:  Reduce cost of energy from large wind systems to 3 cents/kWh in class 6 wind resources by 2004, and to 3 cents/kWh in class 4 wind resources by 2010.  (compared to a 2002 baseline of 4 cents/kWh in class 6, and 5.5 cents/kWh in class 4).  In 2001, the DOE wind energy program launched a major new effort to reach the LWST goal.  The program currently envisions that the LWST project will represent an increasingly large portion of total program funds over the remainder of this decade.  The strategy for the low wind speed technology (LWST) project was developed in cooperation with industry, and guided by several principles:  Public/private partnerships will be developed to support continuing innovation.  They will be flexible and adaptive, support multiple pathways, and offer repeated opportunities for new players to enter the program;  Program research and testing activities will be closely aligned to support public/private partnerships.  Applied systems integration activities will guide portfolio planning and technology transfer;  Program evaluations performed regularly using performance-based management techniques will provide a strong analytical basis for performance criteria, periodic review, and adjustment.  A Phase I request for proposals (RFP) under the low wind speed technology (LWST) project was  issued on October 19, 2001. The RFP offered bidders an opportunity to participate in one of three technical areas, including:  Concept and Scaling studies; Component Development; and Prototype Turbine Development.  Two proposals were selected under each of these technical areas for negotiations leading to NREL subcontract awards.  Solicitation Plan:  Consistent with the described plan, the DOE is planning the release of another RFP in the early Spring of 2003 (representing Phase II of the LWST project).  At this time, the program envisions an RFP structured much like the initial request.  There will be three options open to bidders:  Conceptual Design Studies; Component Development Projects; and Prototype Turbine Development.  Conceptual Design Studies (Technical Area 1) are envisioned as 4-6 month efforts with the maximum DOE funding being $200,000 for any single award.  The program intends to use a cost reimbursable type of subcontract, and cost sharing will not be required of participants under Conceptual Design Studies subcontracts.  However, proposals for Conceptual Design Studies that do propose cost sharing above the $200,000 will be considered.  Component Development (Technical Area 2) is envisioned as a 2-3 year effort with the maximum DOE funding being $3 million for any single award. LWST Prototype Development (Technical Area 3) is envisioned as a 2-3 year effort with the maximum DOE funding being $6 million for any single award. Initial prototype wind turbines are expected to operate by 2007 and the final LWST, which will be funded under a Phase III solicitation, is expected to operate by 2009. These expectations do not preclude an offeror from proposing projects of different duration or cost.  For Component Development subcontracts, the minimum direct cost sharing (by the Offeror) required of industry participants will be 30 percent.  For LWST Prototype Development subcontracts, the minimum direct cost sharing (by the Offeror) required of industry participants will be 50 percent.  Additional consideration in the evaluation process will be given for cost sharing in excess of these amounts.  The program would expect to award 1-3 subcontracts in each area of participation (Technical Area).  Each project will be funded incrementally on an annual fiscal year basis. Throughout the projects, the program will encourage the use of best business and project-management practices. Disciplined engineering development processes, including rigorous laboratory and field tests to verify component and subsystem designs, will be emphasized.  The RFP will require an offeror to describe its proposed concept in sufficient detail to be understood and evaluated by a group of knowledgeable reviewers.  Offerors must also identify the planned teaming arrangements, budget, and schedule for their proposed projects.  The program expects a majority of the subcontract work to be performed within the United States, and offerors will be asked to demonstrate the economic benefits of the proposed project to the United States.  This RFP will be focused on large scale turbine design for utility grid interconnection.  These important requirements will be among the program policy factors considered in evaluating and ranking the submittals.  Qualified business and technical professionals will evaluate these written proposals, which will be restricted to a maximum of 20 pages.  Awards will be based upon technical feasibility, projected COE, offeror?s capabilities, and likelihood of achieving program goals and objectives.  Unsuccessful bidders from the previous solicitation are welcomed to resubmit unsuccessful proposals or submit modified proposals.  Expressions of Interest:  The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants in the project described in the Solicitation Plan.  Therefore, expressions of interest are sought from potential respondents to the forthcoming RFP, and comments on the proposed plan and scope-of-work are sought from all interested parties.  Because the LWST project targets bulk-electricity generation, the program is interested in comments from potential developers, owners, operators, utilities, and manufacturers.  This notice is also intended to promote the formation of industry partnerships and to stimulate interaction among potential participants.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving the RFP and notification of related activities, if they indicate that desire.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of the primary contact person and key collaborators; the potential participants, their affiliations, and their proposed roles; comments on the proposed plan, scope-of-work, cost-sharing, and funding; and a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive a copy of the RFP.  Responses to this notice should not exceed five pages and they should be received at NREL by December 6, 2002.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses by mail or facsimile to:  National Renewable Energy Laboratory,  Attention:  Neil Wikstrom,  Mail Stop 3811,  1617 Cole Blvd.  Golden, CO  80401,  Phone/Fax: 303-384-6960/6901,  References:  The DOE Paper describing the Low Wind Speed Turbine Project and the WindPACT studies can all be obtained from the NREL Web site at the following Web site address:  http://www.nrel.gov/publications/.

<DESC>The Ministry of Transport and Communications of Kyrgyzstan (MTCK) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for an Electronic Government (E-Government) Program for the country of Kyrgyzstan.

The E-Government program is intended to enable the Kyrgyz Government to modernize operations, offer information and provide interactive services online to the general public.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, the state is the primary engine for economic growth and the government has an opportunity to become a catalyst for a domestic "networked" economy.  

While certain computing technologies are employed in ordinary affairs by the Kyrgyz government-day-to-day operations, and internal communications - there is no "E-Government" management.  The use of large managed databases is not common and there is no unified intranet linking government offices.  Individual ministries are beginning to manage programs, albeit independently and without coordination; the lack of government-wide standards creates inefficiencies through duplication of efforts and frequently results in the deployment of incompatible systems and network architectures.

Further, few government services are available from government web sites and portals.  For example, commonly sought information such as data concerning pensions, customs, employment services, government legislation and decrees cannot be obtained electronically.  Similarly, there are no interactive services such as electronic filing of any kind.  Therefore, the Government of Kyrgyzstan is interested in e-government as a way to deliver services in a more efficient manner, using up-to-date technology and interactive internet-based operations.  

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $246,800 grant to the MTCK from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to MTCK c/o TDA by 4:00 P.M. November 25, 2002, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  MTCK reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  MTCK also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  MTCK is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1.  Analyzer shall be portable instrument used to measure individual atmosphere constituents/contaminants.  Any analyzer submitted for consideration as an example of current technology should not exceed size specifications, regardless of the number of measured constituents/ contaminants.  In general, analyzer should be rugged, reliable, user friendly and field compatible. Analyzer should incorporate several sensors into one platform.  Navy is particularly interested in hand-held, portable analyzers that can combine analyses of gases in one device.  Device shall be capable of measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds in balance nitrogen.

<DESC>THE PRIMARY POINT-OF-CONTACT FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS:  Ms. Tracey Washington, (540) 710-5080.  This amendment is to clarify some misleading statements in the original RFI.  The purpose of the RFI is to obtain feedback on the Certificate-based Network Logon Requirements Specification Document.  Comments regarding feasibility, completeness, clarity of the requirements are desired.  At this time, we do not expect products, proof of concepts, technical documentation, tools, or toolkits.  We certainly would appreciate any information you are willing to provide regarding any known products or solutions.  Although not within the duration of this RFI, WHS does intend to invite selected vendors to its proof of concept lab to demonstrate the capabilities of their products, or to demonstrate the ability of their tools and/or toolkits to directly provide a solution for certificate-based network logon.  We apologize for the confusion.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:   

DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of systems, subsystems, and technology that will provide transformational improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of military command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C3ISR) operations in complex environments. The goal of the program is the identification of areas for potential improved performance, and the design and development of systems, sub-systems and core supporting technologies to validate these performance gains. Proposed systems and sub-systems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems. Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases. The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept. Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward increasingly robust technology development.

AREAS OF INTEREST: 

The DARPA Information Exploitation Office (IXO) develops sensor and information system technology and systems with application to battle space awareness, targeting, command and control, and the supporting infrastructure required to address land-based threats in a dynamic, closed-loop process. IXO is focused on addressing the systemic challenges associated with performing surface target interdiction in environments that require very high combat identification confidence and an associated low likelihood for inadvertent collateral damage.

 IXO is addressing the synergies between:

1) Appropriate sensor, sensor control and sensor data exploitation capabilities to detect targets, perform high confidence target identification, to ensure that specified targets (including challenging targets) are correctly engaged without undesirable collateral damage.

2) Dynamic battle management systems, to ensure effective and efficient use of, sensor platforms, weapons, weapons platforms, and resources required for exploitation and decision-making and assessment.

3) Supporting infrastructure, to ensure rapid dissemination, timely processing, effective human-computer interaction, and the availability of suitable threat and terrain models.

Threats of interest include mobile and fixed surface targets (structures, objects, vehicles and dismounts) in all environments: open, partially obscured, in hide (e.g. under foliage), in evasive maneuver and in urban settings.

The challenge of high-confidence target identification impacts a wide range of operational systems and requires development, maturation and integration of new sensor and sensor exploitation approaches with application to:

a) Intelligent seekers to reliably achieve high confidence endgame 

b) Focused identification surveillance automation to confirm ID, and maintain target identity confidence during weapon assignment, launch, and fly out;

c) Local area surveillance to track and identify specific targets while minimizing false alarms, which surveillance is then used to cue the focused identification surveillance; 

d) Wide area surveillance to detect targets while minimizing false alarms; which is then used to cue the local area surveillance, and establish critical situation context; 

e) Dynamic battle management (planning and execution) to prosecute fleeting surface targets in difficult environment and 

f) Integrated and responsive battle damage assessment to evaluate operational effectiveness and guide re-planning.

Dynamic battle management technology is needed to unify control of tactical ground and air-to-ground operations, implement effects-based target analysis and attack against networked systems, and to support overall interactive campaign planning and assessment. 

IXO is pursuing innovative sensor technology to provide new target signature features to enhance target detection and recognition and provide the high confidence identification needed for attack decisions. Sensor/target phenomena that can reduce a target's potential to hide, deceive or counter a surveillance sensor or weapon seeker may be exploited with new sensors and sensor modalities. Technology enhancements to legacy sensor systems and seekers are also being developed to greatly expand their capability for precise target identification

IXO is exploring capabilities to increase the automation of sensor data and information processing and analysis to reduce the manpower and training needed to exploit advanced sensors. This effort emphasizes the application of advanced sensors, sensor modes and sensor platforms to acquire target features coupled with intelligent acquisition of features by multiple-looks and multiple sensor modes.

IXO is investigating command and control technology at the tactical level to automate control of air and ground forces, with minimal but immersive supervision by unit commanders. This includes a focus on dynamic mission planning to improve strike effectiveness. At the targeting level, IXO is exploring effects-based option generation and analysis concepts to achieve precise and timely outcomes with minimal undesired effects. At the campaign level, IXO is investigating mixed-initiative systems to allow geographically distributed planning staffs to collaborate in the continuous construction and assessment of the complex, multi-threaded operations plans required to support dynamic operations in high-threat environments with constrained rules of engagement. At all levels, IXO battle management concepts are addressing the constraints imposed by the requirement to provide combat ID confidence across the full range of rules of engagement.

Sensor, exploitation and battle management systems will achieve flexibility through the use of an advanced computing infrastructure. IXO is addressing advanced correlation, pattern matching, and pattern discovery technologies that exploit relational structures in data, models, and knowledge to describe adversarial networks, organizations, and activities, both in conventional ground operations and in unconventional situations. Agent-based architectures, semantic webs, information dissemination technologies, and reference knowledge bases allow war fighters to adapt information flows to deal with unexpected or unconventional mission requirements.

IXO is addressing these challenges with a balanced program focused on the development, integration and demonstration of systems, subsystems and component technologies and with investigative efforts designed to improve the state of the art in supporting core technologies.

Specific areas of interest include: 

IXO is particularly interested in new and novel techniques to apply C4ISR technology in operational urban combat. Urban environments offer key challenges to precision war fighting, due to the inherent density of urban areas, their three-dimensional nature and the greater likelihood of intermixed combatants, noncombatants and friendlies in the urban context. New concepts are sought to 
1)	provide detailed precision context to support operations in urban environments, including surface, subsurface and internal building features at high resolution  
2)	support precision location, tracking and identification of threat and friendly dismounts and vehicles throughout urban environments using networks of emplaced or opportunistic video sensors
3)	provide sensor and exploitation support for the real time characterization of urban environments to support robotic maneuver in complex urban terrain
4)	support through wall sensing of building interiors
5)	provide new and novel means of isolating urban terrain compartments
6)	provide over watch support and real time situational awareness to forces maneuvering in urban environments
7)	support precision direct and indirect fires in urban environments
8)	provide tracking of individuals and dismounts in urban environments  across a distributed network of emplaced or preexisting video cameras with non-overlapping fields of view
9)	provide precise geolocation of threat communications systems in urban environments
10)	provide command and control to mixed robotic, teleoperated and manned forces in urban environments and
11)	support other novel applications of C4ISR technology in an urban context for peacekeeping, unconventional combat and conventional combat.

IXO is interested in innovative technologies and tools for lightweight planning, course of action analysis, plan representation and plan refinement, with particular emphasis on application to distributed, highly maneuverable land combatants, light infantry, airborne and air assault operations and application supporting special operations forces missions.

IXO is interested in innovative technologies and tools to support the planning, collection management, dynamic tasking, synchronization of organic, tactical, theater and national intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems. Interests include innovative mechanisms for identifying and representing commander?s intent, collection requirements, asset capabilities, availabilities and supporting resources, sensor models, and performing optimal assignment of actors to tasks. IXO is particularly interested in systems for rapid, dynamic re-planning across the full spectrum of available collectors, with further emphasis on active sensing approaches that seek to resolve uncertainty through increasing refined dynamic collection replanning. IXO is particularly interested in system concepts that jointly plan, synchronize and manage ISR and strike capabilities together to improve response performance in time-sensitive engagements.

IXO is interested in advanced concepts, approaches, techniques and tools for the network-centric engagement of time sensitive and evasive targets. Approaches of interest to IXO will enable use of multiple networked sensors across a distributed battle space to collaborate and fuse sensor information, distributed over tactical networks, to localize, identify and track targets of interest. Network-centric approaches may consider the complex interaction of sensors, platforms, communications, command and control systems, and network enabled weapons to provide new engagement capabilities. Concepts of interest may focus on radar (SAR or GMTI), ELINT, SIGINT, COMINT, video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI or other sensor phenomenology.

 IXO is interested in innovative technologies for multi-user collaborative interaction in tactical and operational environments. Applications of interest involve distributed collaborative planning, distributed collaborative control of forces, distributed situational awareness, distributed collaborative sensor data exploitation and others. Potential opportunities include advanced visualization, immersive interfaces, advanced human computer interfaces, natural language, gesture and mixed interfaces and other collaboration enabling technologies.

IXO is interested in emerging technologies which may enable a combination of ubiquitous sensing and computing such as smart pixel concepts, plastic transistors and associated digital logic. IXO is interested particularly in fabrication methodologies that may be ripe for limited system level proof of concept brass board prototyping.

IXO is interested in new radar system concepts for application with unmanned aerial reconnaissance and advanced combat vehicles.  Of particular interest are low cost approaches utilizing electrically scanned antennas demonstrating wide bandwidth and simultaneously wide angular scanning ability in the millimeter wave frequency region.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensors and sensor exploitation techniques for the rapid detection and discrimination of dismounted combatants (to include irregular combatants) using novel RF techniques (including GMTI and SAR imaging), low frequency and UWB radar techniques, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, e-field, trace chemical and seismic acoustic sensing. New concepts are sought for low cost, low power, lightweight close-proximity sensing options as well as standoff vehicle/aircraft/UAV mounted sensor concepts. Of particular interest are concepts capable of detecting and/or discrimination of humans under foliage. Human discrimination characteristics of interest include the ability to discriminate unarmed from armed combatants.

IXO is interested in innovative tools to aid in the automated identification, interpretation and understanding of diverse databases and other active data sources by autonomous and semi-autonomous software agents. IXO is also interested in tools and techniques for rapidly capturing and associating appropriate semantic content with large and distributed data stores. IXO is also interested in new and unique mechanisms to rapidly capture very large corpus expert knowledge in machine manipulable formats for use by intelligent agents.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to detect and/or discriminate small and large vehicular targets under tree canopy. Techniques of interest include novel sensing approaches (such as FOPEN GMTI radar) and novel sensor exploitation techniques (such as 3D radar image reconstruction and rapid wide area change detection approaches). IXO is also interested in new and novel techniques for detecting and/or characterizing targets in revetments, in defilade, and in impromptu subsurface shelters.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensor and sensor exploitation techniques to permit rapid discrimination of both manufactured and impromptu target decoys from actual targets. Also of interest are new and novel techniques to detect and identify targets under camouflage, including optical and RF scattering nets and optical and radar absorbing treatments.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques for tagging, tracking and locating objects, vehicles and dismounts over large areas. IXO is particularly interested in small, low powered, long life devices and techniques, with a focus on capabilities that can be read out from stand off over large areas of regard. Potential applications may be active or passive and may utilize RF, EO/IR, or multi-spectral communications concepts or other phenomenology to designate target items of interest. IXO is also interested in new and novel techniques to deploy small tagants with low probability of detection.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to identify targets of military interest in stand off remote sensing data. This data may consist of 1-D, 2-D or 3D information and may include real beam radar data, HRR profiles, synthetic aperture radar imagery, ultra high-resolution SAR imagery, EO/IR imagery, EO/IR motion imagery, HSI/MSI, stereo cameras and imaging LIDAR sensors. Of interest are very low false alarm rate wide area target detection approaches and focused high probability of correct classification, low error rate approaches to target identification. Also of interest are approaches to ?fingerprinting? targets through prior-free feature measurement approaches, to permit high confidence target reacquisition. IXO is also interested in new and novel approaches to evaluate automatic target recognition capabilities and in new and novel techniques to establish performance bounds for aided and autonomous recognition systems.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensing approaches and sensor data exploitation concepts to support near real time assessment of battle damage and strike effectiveness. Approaches may include novel exploitation of strike platform sensor data or weapons augmentation to provide a BDI/BDA signature.

IXO is interested in novel sensor and sensor data exploitation concepts for the characterization of engagement zones prior to engagement for the purpose of insuring that restrictive rules of engagement are satisfied prior to weapons release and delivery. 

IXO is interested in new and novel approaches for utilizing UAV borne sensor payloads such as high definition motion imagery to support simultaneous tracking, monitoring and engagement of multiple targets within the field of regard (but in separate fields of view) of an airborne sensor.

IXO is interested in new and novel approaches to provide flexible, high bandwidth, low-latency ad hoc networking capability for strike platforms, ISR platforms and weapons. This capability will enable flexible, airborne network centric engagement of evasive targets in complex environments. Approaches of interest include, but are not limited to: novel antennas, highly-integrated, multi-protocol small data-link concepts, novel dynamic network management approaches, and signal reliability and protection approaches for counter spoofing and operation in a jamming environment. Concepts for novel weapon embedded data links are particularly sought, with emphasis on quality of service, low cost and protocol compatibility with other existing or planned terminals.

IXO is interested in pursuing novel tools and techniques focused on treating the dismounted combatant as a sensor and sensor fusion platform. Techniques of interest include distribution and dissemination of video and night vision imagery with appropriate annotation from soldier to soldier (inter-squad) and across and up in echelon. Additional sensing and sensor exploitation concepts may include small micro sensors deployed and monitored by the individual combatant and advanced data fusion, context integration and visualization approaches for dismount manipulation and interpretation of local and remote sensor feeds in real-time.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensor and sensor application approaches capable of providing very high combat identification confidence when cued to a delimited target area. It is desired that these approaches yield a correct probability of identification in the range of 99.9% to 99.999%. Such techniques may imply very high resolution and/or high dimensionality and/or multiple sensed phenomenologies. Implementation of these sensor and sensor exploitation approaches must be practical for the appropriate class of surveillance platform; for close-in sensing these approaches must be consistent with the limited size, weight power and aperture available on a small unmanned air vehicle.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to provide blue force combat identification and IFF. Techniques considered should be appropriate for both surface to surface and air to surface applications and should support IFF of both vehicles and dismounted combatants.

IXO is interested in tools and techniques to permit rapid, custom assembly of C4ISR systems and networks from individual components. Such a capability would permit components from multiple vendors to be bound together in a just-in-time fashion to build ?just enough? C4ISR system capability to support current operations. Additionally, such a capability would allow much more rapid technology refresh for C4ISR components, by permitting sub-components of a system to be replaced independently. Potential areas of effort include development of tools and techniques to permit distributed, machine-to-machine semantic negotiation of software/data/system interfaces, approaches to scale and distribute command and control computing in response to changes in operational tempo and demand for services, and concepts and tools for automated system verification and validation.

IXO is interested in tools and techniques to permit rapid dynamic fusion of multiple sensors across a theater (or other extended battle space) to support high confidence long duration tracking of threat vehicles over time. Such an approach might exploit diversity in collection geometry and diversity in sensor phenomenology and performance to maximize tracking performance using active synchronized tasking of sensors across the entire available platform constellation. Tools and techniques pursued may address tracker architecture and implementation, distributed tracking, multi-phenomenological feature aided tracking and dynamic, active sensor constellation management.

<DESC>BAA 03-03 (Part 2 of 2)

IXO is interested in new and novel applications of micro-UAV mounted sensors for confirmatory identification. Such UAV mounted sensors could be deployed from stand-off strike platforms, fly out into the neighborhood of the target at low altitudes and perform high confidence target recognition, confirm that restrictive rules of engagement are satisfied, and perform post strike BDA. Areas of interest include low cost, lightweight, high performance EO and uncooled IR sensors, image stabilization and reconstruction, sensor/bandwidth trades and tasking and control concepts. IXO is also interested in sensor and onboard sensor exploitation processing appropriate for ?hunter-killer? unmanned air vehicles. Of particular interest are onboard, limited target set automatic target recognition algorithms, approaches for target tracking and identity maintenance and approaches for autonomous search and acquisition.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit mounted and dismounted  land combatants to process and extract situational awareness and targeting information from networks of both local, organic sensors and theater processed sensor feeds. Sensor data may include SAR and GMTI from small UAVs, EO and IR video from many distributed micro-UAVs and radar, optical and acoustic sensor data from ground robotic platforms, and others. Of particular interest are approaches that map appropriate sensor control, tasking, exploitation, presentation and manipulation tools into a processing environment appropriate for a small lightly armed, highly mobile mounted system.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit a limited number of operators to direct a large force of strike and reconnaissance UAVs in a mission/task oriented manner. Particular topics of interest include multi-UAV control strategies, platform self-awareness, task decomposition and assignment techniques, mission level course of action generation and analysis and adaptation strategie. 

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques both to permit improved intelligence preparation of the battle space and improved predictive battle space awareness. Topics of particular interest include terrain amplification and interpretation tools, behavior analysis tools, local and extended mobility models, effects based engagement planning and assessment tools, and others.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques for deployment, management and control of very large-scale agent based systems under stressing environments. Approaches are sought to enable agent-based systems to rapidly scale with demand, to permit recovery from loss of portions of the underlying network and data infrastructure, and to permit operation in the face of computer attack.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to permit autonomous systems to negotiate the assignment, prioritization and customization of resources, in highly resource-constrained environments. Such approaches are required to operate in highly decentralized environments, and provide satisfying solutions under hard schedule constraints. IXO is particularly interested in approaches that scale manageably with very large problems, where information is distributed, and varies in fidelity as a function of proximity to the agent.

IXO is interested in new and novel customizable and composable tools and techniques to support the rapid co-design of systems and software for real time embedded C4ISR systems. IXO is also interested in the development of flexible middleware to support composition of complex embedded systems while managing interrelationships and side effects among assembled software components. 

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit construction of critical real time C4ISR embedded systems from hundreds to thousands of simple, small computing nodes. Such nodes might be collocated with sensors and actuators or might be distributed across network backbones. Key challenges lie in algorithms models and software to coordinate and synthesize computational structure from discrete dispersed nodes. Of critical interest to IXO is achieving scalability and robustness within these networked systems.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit synchronized dynamic planning and management of airborne sensors and strike capabilities to engage ground targets. Key challenges lie in the joint scheduling and synchronization of operation and reconnaissance plans, in anticipating and resolving resource constraints, contingency planning and apportionment of reserves, and dynamic plan construction, assessment, monitoring and evaluation.

IXO is interested in novel approaches for sensing the interior structure of a building to  which one does not have access. Potential solutions could include remote sensing, close-in sensors deployed outside the building, or robots that enter the building and exfiltrate data.   Sensors should provide data on the floor plan, furniture, presence of people, and layout of functional elements such as power lines, water lines, HVAC ducts, and other utilities.

IXO  is interested in new technologies to exploit EO and IR motion imagery on unmanned aerial vehicles in support of precision strike operations, to provide persistent sensing and to support  unambiguous identification and tracking of moving ground targets.    DARPA seeks innovative concepts for significantly advancing the state of the art in tracking vehicles and dismounted soldiers from airborne platforms, even in dense traffic and with frequent occlusions; for deriving detailed descriptions of targets on-the-fly, sufficient to recognize that same target when seen at a later time in a different place; for matching such descriptions to EO and IR video to confirm the identity of the target; for detecting moving personnel and vehicles, without false alarms due to parallax of raised structures, illumination, shadows, wind, etc. for searching a target area for noncombatant people and vehicles that could become unintended casualties of a precision attack; for locating targets observed by airborne video to less than 5 meters absolute geopositioning accuracy, and for classifying vehicles by type, based on observation in EO or IR motion imagery.

IXO is interested in new concepts, approaches and advanced technologies to support the development and demonstration of: 1) a new dismount soldier individual vision system  integrating advanced Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR, 1-2 microns) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8-10 microns) with head-mounted, digital displays and a wireless, high bandwidth, Local Area Network (LAN) capability for image/information fusion and sharing, to replace/complement the current night vision goggles for the individual soldier in urban warfare missions; 2) integrated  image/data fusion software and techniques for non-intrusive dismount information exploitation for the vision systems described above, and 3) low-cost, soldier-carried/deployed and controlled micro sensors (imaging and non-imaging) to allow the individual soldier (squad leader, fire teams, platoon leader) to gather, share and exploit battlefield information in real time, day and night, with other team members and commanders in urban warfare missions.

PROGRAM SCOPE: 

Up to $20.0M may be available in FY 2003 for initial efforts. Multiple awards are anticipated during FY 2003. The amount of funds, if any, for efforts beyond FY 2003 has not been decided. Successful efforts during the initial funding period will increase the likelihood that IXO will make funds available after FY 2003. For Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month effort followed by one or more optional efforts. The total effort including options should not exceed four years. 

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

<DESC>The 38 Engineering Installation Group/PKL, Contracting Division, is conducting a small industry day in conjunction with the release of a Request for Information (RFI) to industry for comments.  The date for this industry date is 5 Nov 02 and will be held at Rose State College Auditorium, Midwest City OK.  Any small business concern planning to attend can call Chris Hampton at (405) 734-9637 or Billy Boykin at (405) 734-9788 for directions.  The new strategy migrates from a site-by-site competitive process multiple award, performance-based, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) process.  One Request for Proposal (RFP) will result in the award of four ?on call? ID/IQ contracts (to four different contracts) which contain quarterly Award Fee provisions.  Each contract is one base year with six one-year options although services on each contract are limited to a total of 60 months per task order to ensure compliance with the Service Contract Act.  Participation is set-aside exclusively for small business concerns qualifying under NAIC code 811212.  Oral presentations by each offeror will be a part of the competitive RFP process.  Request your thorough review of the draft in advance of the meeting.   Submit any questions/concerns in writing to chris.Hampton@tinker.af.mil no later than 31 Oct 02.  Additional questions/concerns are allowed beyond this date although there may not be sufficient time to provide responses by the Nov meeting.  Final questions are required by 14 Nov 02.  In order for this to be a productive meeting, we encourage your candid feedback; your input is invaluable and essential in making the new contract vehicle supporting 38th O&M requirements across the Air Force as efficient as possible.   This new strategy not only reduces the contracting lead time from 12-18 months to 90 days, we believe it allows industry to focus on the ?results? of its company?s performance rather than the ?how to? of getting the job done.  No telephone request for this RFI will be accepted.  The RFI will be paperless and will be released using the Electronic Posting (EPS) via the www (www.eps.gov).  The RFI will contain files in MS Office 2000.  DO NOT request any documents in writing.  A registration page for the solicitation will be available at the solicitation web page.

<SUBJECT>A -- HIGH PRECISION, RAPID LASER DRILLING TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE SEEKS PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE HIGH PRECISION, RAPID LASER DRILLING TECHNOLOGY

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license rapid and high precision laser hole drilling technology.

LLNL has a new technology for rapidly drilling precision holes with lasers.  The technology uses two types of pulsed laser beams to achieve rapid yet precise hold drilling, even with high aspect ratio holes.  The laser beams can come from one or multiple lasers.  The first laser beam removes most of the material while the second laser beam operates more precisely to finish drilling the hole to the desired tolerances.

The first laser beam operates in the percussion mode using an infrared wavelength.  This mode uses a pulse length and power that exceeds the ablative threshold (approx.109 watts/cm2) to minimize the size of the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ).  This first laser beam rapidly removes material and creates an initial hole (It removes approximately 1 micron of material per pulse with a pulse rate of 10 to 20 kHz).  Because of its high repetition rate, the laser performs its work quickly with 300 micron diameter, 1 mm deep holes being drilled in about a second.  The operation of this laser results in a rough hole since some of the ablated material - condenses on the sides of the hole.

The second laser beam operates in the trepanning mode with a beam diameter roughly 10 times smaller than the diameter of the hole.  It operates at the ablation threshold at significantly less power than the first and typically operates at a shorter wavelength.  This laser beam finishes drilling the hole by removing the ablated material from the sides of the walls and. any small amount of starting material necessary to create the finished hole with the desired precision tolerances.  Since the second laser beam does not have to remove a significant amount of material and, since there is no possibility of trapped ablated material to stall the drilling, it also finishes its operation quickly - typically of the order of a few seconds.  

As an added feature, the first laser need not drill all the way through the substrate, but rather, can leave a thin membrane which blocks the transmission of the laser beam through the sample.  The second trepan laser can complete the precision hole by removing the membrane at the end of the drilling operation. This technique minimizes the amount of laser energy transmitted through the material being drilled, which is advantageous for many applications.

When operated alone the trepan laser can drill 20 micron holes in millimeter thick substrates in a second with taper of less than 2:1 and with a dimensional tolerance of a micron.

LLNL believes this is a very practical system.  No vacuum chamber is required for this process as is often the case with ultra short pulse laser drilling.  This hole drilling technique promises to work particularly well with the industrial quality lasers developed by LLNL, which have demonstrated thousands of hours of industrial operation.  Also, this technology provides a practical means to drill holes in many types of materials including metals (refractory metals too), semiconductors, and ceramics.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's high precision, rapid laser hole drilling technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.Company Name and address.
2.The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FB00002/03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's high precision, rapid laser hole drilling technology.
