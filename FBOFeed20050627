Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, on behalf of Redstone Technical Test Center(RTTC), Development Test Command, US Army Test and Evaluation Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Pratt and Whitney Measurement Systems, Inc.  Specifically, RTTC has the need for LabMaster Unversial with accessories.  The LabMaster, manufactured by Pratt and Whitney, utilizes a laser interferometer to measure internal and external dimensions as opposed to other scales such as glass, steel or LVDT's. Because the laser has a thermal coefficient of expansion it is more than ten times smaller than that of steel, the system is much more stable, thus supplying a system accuracy of .04 microns.  This announcement is published as a Sole Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST July 7, 2005 will be considered by the Government.  The anticipated award date is July 8, 2005.

<DESC>1) To conduct a national exit poll for the 2005 Azerbaijani parliamentary elections.

2) To publish the results of the exit poll before the Azerbaijani government announces the official results of the election with first preliminary results to be announced at the press conference immediately following closings of the polling stations.

3) To set up a computer and reporting system within the local counterpart’s office in order to create the technical capacity of the local organization necessary for professional implementation of the exit polls in the future elections. 

4) To create a cadre of professionally-trained local pollsters who are sufficiently knowledgeable to be able to train others.

USAID believes that the parliamentary elections will be held in the beginning of November 2005 with the final date to be announced sometime at the beginning of July 2005.  The proposed duration of this project is from September 2005 to November 2005.  Contractor will conduct the exit poll activity for the Azerbaijani parliamentary elections in November 2005 and will publicize the results quickly to a broad audience.

Contractor will work with USAID on identifying specific regions and constituencies where exit poll interviews will be conducted.

The offerors will be requested to submit 10-page organizational capabilities statement including past performance. USAID will evaluate the organizational capacity proposals and invite organizations considered the most highly qualified to present oral, technical presentations to a USAID team located in Baku, Azerbaijan.  This is likely to happen very shortly after submission of the organizational capacity proposals and offerors are advised to be prepared to travel to Baku. Cost proposals will be requested from oferrors determined for further consideration for award. Cost will be evaluated for general reasonableness, allocability, allowability, cost-effectiveness. Given the limited time the offerors invited for technical presentation should be able to submit cost proposals shortly after the technical selection is completed.

In addition, final award of any resultant contract cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed through internal USAID procedures.  While it is anticipated that these procedures will be successfully completed, potential offerors are hereby notified of these requirements and conditions for award.

<DESC>U.S. relations with Vietnam have increased dramatically in the past decade as the Vietnamese society has opened and the economy has developed at a rate among the highest in the world.  Environment, Science, Technology and Health are important and growing elements to this relationship.  This will only increase as science and technology become more important in the economy and as environmental challenges increase accordingly.  The choice of Vietnam as a focus country in the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief illustrates the importance of global health as a U.S. Mission goal.  As a result of these trends, it is vital to establish an ESTH office to support the Ambassador in these sectors.  The ESTH Officer reports on and coordinates science, technology, environmental and health issues with the Government of Vietnam (GVN) and among mission elements such as the U.S. Asia Environmental Partnership (USAEP), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Foreign Agricultural Service, Health and Human Services, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as with the Economic Section and the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City.  A major responsibility of the ESTH officer is to support the Ambassador’s oversight of PEPFAR.  S/he coordinates the work of the Ambassador's policy group on “Agent Orange”.

<DESC>Little Pines Recreation Area Campground Improvements - This Request for Proposals is for the construction of a new camploop at Little Pines Recreation Area, located on the Poteau Ranger District near Waldron, Scott County, Arkansas, on the Ouachita National Forest.  The work consists of decommissioning 2 bathhouses, roads and other listed items and constructing a camp loop with utilities, and an add alternate for construction of two floating boat docks.  This will result in a firm fixed price construction contract.  
Proposals will be evaluated using a process considering qualifications, technical and price factors.  The relative importance of the technical evaluation factors will be considered more important than the price factor unless the technical evaluation of competing offers is approximately the same, at which time the price factor will become relatively more important. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government may, after evaluation, award without discussions or conduct further oral discussion with any or all offerors.  Award will be made to the Offeror: (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the "best value" to the Government.  Contract performance period is 180 calendar days. The Government's estimate is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 237310, and the small business size standard is $28.5 Million.

TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The federal office building is located in downtown Houston, Texas. The goal of this project is to substantially enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of an existing twenty-two story federal office building and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building and its existing urban fabric. The project delivery method will be the traditional design-bid-build.

Space alterations are primarily finishes in the elevator lobbies and actual interior wall replacements will be minimal.  The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

<DESC>WILLOW CREEK STEWARDSHIP Program Goals / Purpose This project proposes the exchange of forest thinning on ten (10) acres for approximately 100 cords conifer/aspen.  The Willow Creek aspen regeneration project is a hazardous fuels reduction that has an additional benefit of improving wildlife habitat. The project area is on the west side of Green Mountain in Fremont County and is approximately 10 acres in size.  Aspen is the prominent plant component within these treatment units, but lodgepole and limber pine are encroaching and overtaking the aspen stands.  In the absence of fire, the area has experienced a significant increase in live and dead woody material and correspondingly, an increased potential for uncontrollable wildfire behavior. Consistent with the President's Healthy Forest Initiative (2002) and the National Fire Plan's 10-year Comprehensive Strategy and Implementation Plan (2002), this project will reduce the likelihood of catastrophic fire within the watershed destroying public forest resources and potentially endangering the lives of adjacent private landowners and firefighters. The Willow Creek II project is also consistent with The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (2003) as it will reduce wildfire risk and "protect, restore, and enhance forest ecosystem components." The project is within Condition Class 3 and Fire Regime III.  This is a forest health and hazardous fuels reduction project.  Timber that will be cut, lopped and scattered on the treatment areas will be available for wood products such as fencing material firewood.  A Stewardship Contract (exchanging goods for services) will enable the BLM to complete the project as well as provide wood products to the local community. Place of Performance Green Mountain in Fremont County, Wyoming.  West side of Green Mountain in the Willow Creek Drainage. Benefits Reduction on non-Wildland/Urban interface hazardous fuels and forest health restoration of aspen habitat important to a variety of wildlife species. Aspen stands throughout Green Mountain have been experiencing a general decline in health due to a variety of factors, notable the significant increase in conifers at higher elevation sites. This project will restore the health of the aspen stands within the treatment area.  Healthy aspen stands have been noted as displaying fire behavior that is less extreme than comparable stands of conifer.  This project will have established forest stand transects and photopoints established to measure effectiveness of treatment and quantify the resultant plant community responses.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Aircraft Support Division, AIR 2.5 plans to award a sole source small purchase order to Craft Technologies, Inc., Wilson, NC to conduct dynamic Computational Fluid Dynamics Flow Solver (CFD) Simulation of Coupled F/A-18/CVN-76 Recovery to Carrier.  NAVAIR has a need for the performance of CFD simulations to investigate the coupling between an aircraft and ship airwake during an F/A-18 landing scenario.  Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of Craft’s Computational Fluid Dynamics flow solver, CRUNCH, to predict the time varying flowfield over a ship’s superstructure for fixed wing operations.  This capability is essential to predicting the coupling effect of the combined ship and aircraft wakes.  Craft developed the CRUNCH flow solver and retains the proprietary rights.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the CRUNCH flow solver, Craft is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the CRUNCH flow solver design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than Craft Technologies would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is five months.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to julie.blew@navy.mil.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for various probes and a logic analyzer to increase the capability of an existing NASA LaRC owned 4 channel 4 GHZ Tektronix oscilloscope.  Probes to be acquired include: two active probes (P7350) for higher precision measurements, two passive probes identical to the current set (P7240) to fully utilize the channels available with comparable measurement probes; two adapters (TCA-1M) for the Tektronix proprietary attachment form factor to 1Meg passive probes for lower precision measurements but a larger dynamic range hence providing more information about the circuit without potentially damaging the current passive probes; two adapters to BNC (TCA-BNC) to allow use of some of the currently available but older probes for simpler measurements that do not require the precision, but do require the larger dynamic range, and two voltage probes suitable for accurately	measuring voltage rails up to 15V (beyond the range of passive and active probes listed above.  The logic analyzer includes: A mainframe (TLA7012) used to house the processing unit and interface to the probing modules; An IView oscilloscope kit (TLA70121C) used to link the logic analyzer with the in-house Tektronix oscilloscopes providing functionality used to time correlate logical phenomena with high precision oscilloscope measurement and view oscilloscope traces on the Logic analyzer screen with Logic Analyzer traces; A 102 channel logic analyzer module (TLA7AA3) which will support multi-site examination of 32-bit buses as well as remote collateral logic for insight into the system performance as a whole which is critical to the design and debug of PCI systems; An increase to the 102 Logic Analyzer probe module (TLA7AA3S) increasing memory depth for Logic Analyzer traces.  This allows the capture of longer activities such as large DMA bursts; and three 34 channel probe attachments (P6810) for single ended or differential measurements. Probe attachments are required to interface the Logic Analyzer to the hardware and these are suitable for the types of measurements needed for the current project efforts. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Tektronix as the only known reasonable source because the probes are for an existing oscilloscope and no other vendor makes compatible probes; the logic analyzer has been selected for its functionality to incorporate real-time, the traces and control of an external oscilloscope. This action is taken in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 6, 2005.

<DESC>TITLE:  PHOTONIC COMPONENTS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-07-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 July 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Sep 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Sensors Directorate, Photonics Technology Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to advance the technology in the area of photonic components and systems.  Areas of interest include devices, components, techniques, systems and applications.  

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to analog modulation of optical carriers, efficient external modulators, highly linear modulators, phase modulation techniques, optical arbitrary waveform generation, low jitter pulsed lasers for analog to digital converters, near-zero linewidth lasers, optical signal processors, integration of photonic devices and circuits, system design and modeling.   Optical modulators operating at 1550 nanometers using polymer or semiconductor material systems are of prime interest for their potential for improving performance and manufacturability.  Lithium Niobate is another material system of interest that could be used to explore new ideas in areas such as linearization for high spur free dynamic range (SFDR) analog applications.  Specific modulator performance goals include a two-tone SFDR > 130 dB in a 1-Hz bandwidth, at a 10 GHz center frequency with a bandwidth > 3 GHz.  Issues of concern include ease of fabrication and fabrication tolerances, performance stability, insensitivity to temperature (over the range of -55C to 85C), low insertion loss (< 5db fiber-to-fiber), and the potential for extending performance to higher frequencies and wider bandwidths, (nominally 2 -20 GHz).  Optical arbitrary waveform generation includes the development of a robust, practical, stable octave-spanning optical oscillator, and its ability to independently encode (both via amplitude and phase modulation) a significant portion of the individual frequency components with an update rate approaching the mode-locked repetition rate.  Also of interest is the study of optical pulse shapes that benefit laser radar (LADAR) systems in terms of improvement of signal to noise and higher target detection probabilities.  

Deliverables will include technical reports, technology demonstrations which prove out the concepts proposed, and samples of components and devices developed.

II. AWARD  INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.5M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $0.50M; FY 06 - $1.25M; FY 07 - $1.25M; and FY08 - $1.5M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging between $100K to $1M per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

<DESC>The Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has a requirement for services from a qualified source to provide the necessary personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, to characterize naturally occurring avian paramyxoviruses (APV) and identify strains suitable for further development as vaccine vectors to express antigens of highly pathogenic agents for human immunization.  The contractor will support intramural NIAID pre-clinical research work to identify APV that are infectious and attenuated in non-human primates acting as surrogates of humans, that are not highly pathogenic in birds, that replicate in Vero cells, and that can be made into recombinant form and engineered to express antigens of highly pathogenic human viruses to induce satisfactory immune responses in non-human primates.

 

Specifically, the Contractor shall: prepare working pools of APV (in particular avian parainfluenza viruses and avian metapneumoviruses); characterize each APV strain with regard to replication in vitro; perform antigenic analysis; prepare biologically cloned virus suspensions; perform replication and pathogenicity in birds and embryonated eggs; perform replication in hamsters; support LID/NIAID primate studies; perform sequence analysis; perform reverse genetic studies; support construction and analysis of APV-based vectored vaccines; complete studies with highly pathogenic agents; deliver results and materials; and maintain records and biological materials.

 

Offerors will be evaluated on the experience and capabilities of professional and technical personnel that would be assigned to this project; established capability for laboratory work and animals testing (rodents or chickens) at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3; and experience with viral infection of animals and virus isolation from animals at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3. The Offeror must also have, or be able to obtain, Select Agent approval for work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5 and H7) as well as approval by the United States Department of Agriculture for work with the above-mentioned highly pathogenic avian viruses as well as with Newcastle disease virus mesogenic strains.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available electronically on/about July 22, 2005, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps Home Page at www.fedbizopps.gov. 

 

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement type award will be made on or about December 1, 2005, for a base year, including options for five additional years.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Policy Simulation Group, Washington, DC  20017 (www.polsim.com) under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” for continued evaluations of the distributional implications of contributions and benefits in the Social Security Old-age and Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program under current law and under various policy proposals.  
The requirements call for a dynamic microsimulation model of the Social Security population as it stands now and as is projected to be in the future for a few hundred years.  The model must be capable of closely replicating the Social Security Trustees projections of costs and benefits using the Trustees’ intermediate assumptions.  The model must also be able to show the cost and distributional impacts of changing the Trustees’ assumptions.  Cost impacts must be both aggregated and separable in to the two trust funds (Old-age and Survivors Insurance, and Disability Insurance).  Distributional impacts must include demographic information for each individual simulated, as well as lifetime payroll taxes and Social Security benefits.  Various Social Security policy parameters must be changeable in the model and must have flexible phase-in schedules. These include, but are not limited to payroll taxes, early and full retirement ages, bend point dollar values and bend point percentages, CPI-indexing and wage-indexing of the benefit formula, and individual accounts.  A capable source must be able to implement new policy proposals that are not currently in the model in a reasonable time frame, typically within one month of the Government’s request.  Outputs from the model must allow for the creation of distributional tables by birth cohort, sex, income level, and education, as well as for pre-defined “stylized” individuals and couples.   The model output must be available in text files, but can be in other formats as well.  Any given policy run must be executable on a dual-processor 3.2 gigahertz PC with two gigabytes of RAM (or equivalent) in 30 minutes or less.
SSA is currently using Policy Simulation Group’s SSASIM and GEMINI software and support to satisfy the above requirements.  
Any other vendor capable of performing the above requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of business on July 11, 2005 and refer to SSASIM-05.  The evidence must include a discussion of how the software product would satisfy the requirements, contact information on up to three (3) customer references, and associated GSA Schedule or commercial price information on the software and support.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.   Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with Nielsen//NetRatings Inc. to provide Internet Demographic Services and Customized Analysis specific to SSA’s website the Social Security Online for one base year with four 12 month option year periods. Nielsen/NetRatings, Inc. is the only known source that can provide all of the requirements described below, and based on previous market research, is the only known source that can provide this requirement most economically.  
	 A major goal of SSA’s strategic plan is to deliver high-quality, citizen-centered service. An important building block to meeting this goal is to understand the individuals we serve; what they need and how they desire to do business with the government.  Customer insight programs, surveys and demographic data are critical elements in identifying these critical citizen-centered services.  Social Security has provided a robust set of services via the Internet, yet we have not seen the usage that we anticipated or expected.  In order to meet our agency performance measures in the area of online service utilization, the agency must better understand our online customers so that we can ensure that we are meeting their needs through the least expensive method of delivering services, self help via the website, Social Security Online. As one of our benchmarks in measuring performance of this website, we require the services of a third party to provide us with Internet audience information and analysis that is specific to SSA. Current analysis tools used by Social Security Online provide data on the public’s usage of our website, but no information on the demographics of that specific customer segment.  Obtaining this type of information would provide us with invaluable market information and profiles on our online users, which in turn, allows us to respond to customer needs dealing with website content and applications.   Nielsen//NetRatings Inc. is the only known source with the following mandatory qualifications in support of this work:  (a) Privacy protection, including an opt-in model, e.g., a panel of members of the public who consent to tracking of their Web behavior on a regular and ongoing basis; (b) Unique individual reporting (versus machine level reporting); (c) Demographic data to include gender, age, income level, education, race/ethnic group, occupation and region of country; (d) Syndicated site level reporting ; (e) Syndicated page level detail;(f) Unduplicated usage across websites; (g) Duration of Internet application usage; (h) Loyalty metrics (i.e. retention rate, site visit rate, and site visit return rate); (i) Bi-lingual Random Digital Dial Recruitment of Hispanics.  
	The contractor shall provide several key service components to include: Competitive Analysis; Strategic and Media Planning; Strategic Usage Data and Corporate Development; Privacy Protection of Panelists; and Strategic Use of Technology. In addition, the contractor shall provide access to a superior web based reporting tool for demographics, historical data for trend reporting and unlimited client support which should include training on an as needed basis. These services should provide both predefined reports and user-defined query capability featuring in-depth measurements of Internet user behavior at home, work, and a home/work combination. Reports will include unique audience size and composition down to the page level, time spent demographics, and comprehensive trending. 
	Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Michele Tubman via email at Michele.tubman@ssa.gov no later than July 7, 2005, 9:00 a.m. EST.  Responses shall be marked SSA-RFQ-05-1489, CAPABILITY STATEMENT. All questions must be submitted in writing to Michele Tubman via email to Michele.tubman@ssa.gov  on or before June 29, 2005. All questions submitted after June 29, 2005 may not receive a response before the cutoff date and must be submitted via email to Loretta.Hawley@ssa.gov . All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a solicitation will be issued to Nielsen//NetRatings Inc. Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sandra Davis, 256-955-2192
<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to enter into a non-competitive contract to provide support to the Medical Technology Program as required for services relating to: 1) the development, acquisition, and modification of m edical imagery and clinical data bases; 2) translation of algorithms developed by USASMDC in MATLAB to C++; and 3) development of a user interface to access algorithms, process data from these databases and display results to end users.  The services requi red to meet the needs of USASMDC include a broad range of technical and analytical activities related to the development of medical data bases and user interfaces to access and manipulate said databases on a distributed processor architecture.  The contrac tor has developed and delivered clinical databases for the Huntsville medical community to include Huntsville Hospital and Huntsville Surgery Center.  These databases will be integrated with clinical data provided by Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC)  to develop a database to train Response Surface Methodology algorithms developed by USASMDC to predict probability of breast cancer in women based on life style, blood chemistry, etc., Anomaly Detection Algorithm (ADA), Response Surface Methodology (RSM) algorithms, and other image processing and statistical prediction algorithms written in MATLAB will be translated to C++.  The effort involves the development of a database of mammograms, MRI images and ultrasound images for access and manipulation by SMDT C algorithms for detection and discrimination of breast cancer.  The contractor has developed the clinical database that will be a part of the effort. The contractor is familiar with the medical community and how the data is collected and how it is interpr eted.  The contractor has extensive knowledge in the development of medical databases and their implementation on multiple processor systems.  Vital Solutions, LLC is the only contractor with the ability to perform these tasks in the near term, and in a ti mely and cost effective manner, without unacceptable impacts to both the USASMDC and WRAMC requirements and schedules.  Unacceptable delays to a multiyear ambitious schedule are certain to result unless the incumbent is placed under contract.  An alternate  performer would also incur substantial costs (related to staff training/spin up time on software/hardware and associated processes, and implementation of development processes) to the Government which can not be expected to be recovered through competitio n.  Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii), this action is directed toward Vital Solutions, LLC.  All responses should be directed to USASMDC and must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of the publi cation of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested person s may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under a n existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the dis cretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   See notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>This modifies the subject solicitation DG1330-05-RP-1070 issued on April 28, 2005, synopsized previously under DG1330-05-RP-1057.  

The modification is necessary due to a need to restructure the statement of work as written to delete any work related to distribution, locator and duplicating services. The distribution, locator and duplicating services will be solicited by the Government Printing Office (GPO) as a separate contract.  At this time, we plan to modify the present solicitation to remove the distribution, locator and duplicating services to be procured through GPO from the statement of work. A modification to the solicitation will be issued within 2-3 weeks. The present proposal due dates are hereby suspended and a new proposal due date will be established in the next modification when it is issued. All questions concerning the solicitation that have been submitted previously will be retained and addressed in the next modification to the solicitation to be issued. The Government anticipates a new contract start date of October 1, 2005.   


The modification to solicitation will be posted to the fedbizopps web site when available. NOAA wants to assure all potential offerors that this acquisition is still a competitive 8(a) procurement and the only reasons for the delay is due to the facts stated above.

<DESC>MOD: The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement for depot-level support of the CFM56-2A-2 engine for the E-6B program.  The CFM56-2A-2 is a General Electric/SNECMA (CFM International) commercial engine.  The E-6B has four CFM56-2A-2 engines on each of the 16 aircraft.  The proposed procurement will be a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) strategy.  The contractor will provide complete depot-level engine maintenance to support the needs of the entire E-6B fleet, 75 engines total (64 on-wing/11 spares) and total integrated logistics support including the provision of all spare engines, asset repair management (spares and consumables), obsolescence management, reliability and maintainability management, configuration management, commercial technology insertion, transportation, sustaining engineering (SE) and any other innovative supply support solutions plus the labor necessary for such maintenance.  Use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) certified parts and components will be required.  Based on current flight hour projections, the anticipated scheduled maintenance for additional workload will be one engine in FY08, nine engines in FY09, four engines in FY10, four engines in FY11, five engines in FY12, three engines in FY13, six engines in FY14, seven engines in FY15 and six engines in FY16.  The anticipated unscheduled maintenance workload is four engines per year for the life of the contract.  This is subject to change since forecasting for unscheduled maintenance is based on historical data.

It is anticipated that the contractor will be accountable for maintaining the entire inventory throughout the duration of the contract and that the contractor will be held to the availability metrics in the contract, such as:

&#61623;	Engine Availability
o	24-hours delivery to STRATCOMWINGONE, Tinker AFB with required SE

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to update section G.3 entitled Invoice Instructions and to respond to vendor questions.

G.3 Invoice Instructions
a. The Contractor shall submit only one invoice for each task.  Invoice shall be submitted within 30 days of completion of each task. In certain circumstances, where a task order project may extend for a period of more than 90 days, the contractor may submit invoices monthly with consent from the Contracting Officer or Ordering Official.  The Contractor shall submit accurate and complete invoices that include one copy of receipts for all expenditures and subcontractor costs.  If the Contractor is unable to gather all the receipts for expenditures and subcontractor costs within this 30-day timeframe, the Contractor shall report to the COTR the outstanding balance and reason for the delay. The Contractor shall submit one original invoice, one invoice copy, and another invoice copy that includes the back-up documentation to verify expenditures. Invoices shall be formatted in accordance with the invoice sample provided in Attachment A.  Contractor should note that payment for each invoice may take up to 30 days from the approval date of the invoice.

b. A proper invoice must include the name and address of the Contractor; the contract number; task order number; description, quantity, unit price of the services performed on an itemized basis; shipping and payment terms; name and address of the Contractor official whom payment is to be sent; name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice; and your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).  If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the COTR will return it within 7 days after receipt with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice.  

The Contractor shall submit a SF-1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal with each invoice.  The SF-1034 can be located on the GSA Forms Library website:
      http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF

The Contractor must demonstrate maximum practicable competition for each Other Direct Cost (ODC).

Invoice shall be submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the following address:

NIST Financial Services Division
Building 101 Room A-836
Mail Stop 3752
100 Bureau Drive
Gaithersburg, MD  20899

Responses to Vendor Questions

Question 1:  The original RFP limited the Technical Volume to 20 pages. This limitation was not stated in the updated RFP. Does this mean that there are now no page limits? The previous Section L also included other requirements such as double spaced text, etc. which are not included in the June 13 update. 

Answer 1:  See amendment 3 to the solicitation.

Question 2:  Will DoC accept contract references where work was performed as a subcontractor to a U.S. Government Prime Contractor?

Answer 2:  Yes, see solicitation page 32, Section L5(b)(2)(B)(2)(a)

Question 3:  Section G, Paragraph b requires proof that at least three estimates were obtained for all ODCs in order for them to be reimbursed. Will exceptions be made in situations where materials must be procured in-country and there may only be a single vendor or supplier? Does this requirement also apply to travel (airfare, lodging, etc.)?

Answer 3:  See solicitation amendment 4.  The Contractor must demonstrate maximum practicable competition for each Other Direct Cost (ODC).

Question 4:  What is the approximate split between interpretation hours in the U.S. vs. overseas locations?

Answer 4:  Most of the interpretation will be done overseas.  DOC offices typically use the Department of State for translating here in the U.S.  

Question 5:  What is the purpose of the “English Interpreter”? We consider this to mean a native English speaker who interprets primarily from a foreign language to English. If this is the intent, what specific languages will require interpretation into English?

Answer 5:  All of the languages listed in the solicitation may be required.

Question 6:  The RFP includes a requirement to provide a Jr. and Sr. Legal Analyst. How will these individuals interact with the other contract legal advisors and is it anticipated that they will work at the contractor’s facility in the U.S. or at one of the current (or future) overseas operating locations?

Answer 6:  These are the two categories for legal advisors.  They will work off-site in the U.S., at CLDP’s offices for meetings and consultations and in the host countries as projects are outlined.  It should be expected that most of the work (approximately 75%) will be done overseas.

Question 7:  Can you tell me if this has been awarded?  What company was awarded the contract?  We are interested in offering contracting services to the winner of this contract.

Answer 7:  Once an award is made, notice of award will be posted to FedBizOpps.

Question 8:  Do you know how much the contract is worth?

Answer 8:  No.

Question 9:  Would you consider our hotel for a lodging option?

Answer 9:  The DOC will not award by line item.  Per Section L of the solicitation, we reserve the right to make multiple contract awards.  The successful offeror(s) must be able to fully accomplish all requirements of this contract.

THIS REQUEST WOULD BE PERFORMED AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATION:  CSPCRPCC, 2401 Centre Avenue SE., Albuquerque, NM 87106. Description: This is a sources sought.  No solicitation is available at this time.   The CSPCRPCC is a federal program operating under the Department of Veterans Affairs, Research and Development program.  They serve veterans and the community by managing the pharmaceutical and regulatory aspects of clinical trials for medical research.  The system needs to adhere to the federal government’s Standard General Ledger, and all government security and privacy regulations. The Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Clinical Research Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) has a requirement to purchase Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ERP software, consulting, and training to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning Software system.  Specifically, they wish to purchase the following integrated modules of an ERP software system with consulting and training sufficient to implement the software at their location in Albuquerque, NM. Financial Accounting (General Ledger) The CSPCRPCC receives both appropriated and non-appropriated funding and operates in a project management environment.   They desire a system that will provide accountability by appropriated and non-appropriated funding with the ability to consolidate the two as well as the ability to account for funds and costs by funding source and by project.   The current financial system does not involve formal accounting procedures, so the Chart of Accounts and transactions codes will be built specifically for this system, based on the Federal Standard General Ledger.  Data will not be exchanged with any federal accounting/procurement system.  This is a stand-alone system.  Human Resources The CSPCRPCC has approximately 100 employees, with federal appointees, not-for-profit employees, and employees from the local university.  The Human Resources module must be able to handle three disparate personnel systems.  Current staff information and history is contained in an Access database, and this historical information must be transferred to the Human Resources module.  Staffing is expected to grow commensurate with activities at the CSPCRPCC.  The CSPCRPCC desires a system to track personnel actions and to report such actions independently for each hiring authority or together. Training Training The CSPCRPCC is currently using Eduneering as its learning management platform, and has a need to track classroom training, technology delivered training, and professional development for 100 employees.  The LMS must be capable of launching VA computer based training as well as AICC/SCORM compliant training.  It must be able to interface with the VA’s planned learning management platform (Plateau).  Currently, the CSPCRPCC delivers approximately 6700 hours of training annually. Project Management The CSPCRPCC operates in a project management environment with clinical trials that span a period from 1 - 20 years.  The Center currently has 23 CSP Trials and 21 extramural trials underway, and growth is expected.  The CSPCRPCC operates with 7 project teams composed of a pharmacist and project manager.  Each project team is responsible for managing all aspects of the trial, including budget, cost management, and financial reporting.  A solution that features the ability to track committed and obligated costs and therefore remaining budget/funding available by project is sought.  No patient data will be entered into the system.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  NSWC Panama City, on behalf of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) System Joint Program Office (JPO), seeks information from firms capable of providing Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) Increment II System Development and Demonstration (SD&D).  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION and COMMENTS from Industry that will help the Government develop a longer term contracting strategy for DJC2.   The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Again THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise t! o pay for any information submitted by respondents to this request.   The Government will take reasonable care to protect and limit the access to information submitted to only those Government employees and JPO support contractor employees that are directly involved in the development and execution of the program’s acquisition strategy. The support contractors and their involved employees have executed non-disclosure agreements with the Government in regard to this program.  The contractors that administratively support this effort are: Applied Research Associates, Inc., Albuquerque, NM, The Titan Corporation, San Diego, CA, and Radiance Technologies, Inc. Huntsville, Alabama.    Background.   Summary.  DJC2 is a DoD major Information Technology (IT) investment and is designated as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program.  DJC2 is required because existing JFC deployable joint C2 capabilities are neither standardized nor interoperable across the Military Services and Regional Combatant Commanders (RCCs), and do not capitalize on emerging technology.  The current ad hoc approach to establishing and equipping Joint Task Forces (JTFs) in a crisis delays operations and limits the ability for effective C2 during quickly developing operations.  The DJC2 capability is urgently needed to be operationally dedicated for deployment across the full spectrum of conflict, and to be reconfigurable to meet specific mission objectives.  DJC2 is one of the Department of Defense’s (DoD’s) highest priority Command and Control (C2) programs, and is a key component of the DoD transformation strategy to achieve a truly joint C2 capability at ! the Joint Forces Commander (JFC) level.  System Description.  DJC2 will provide a modular and rapidly reconfigurable suite of hardware, networking, supporting infrastructure, and mobility components, as well as limited organic en route and early-entry communications capabilities.  The system is designed to provide JFCs a mission critical, integration of systems with which to plan, control, coordinate, execute, and assess operations across the spectrum of conflict.  Core C2 functionality of DJC2 Increment II will be transitioned from Global Command and Control System – Joint (GCCS-J) to the Joint Command and Control (JC2) system. The DJC2 program supports the Standing Joint Force Headquarters (SJFHQ) concept and doctrine developed by the U.S. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) in coordination with other RCCs and the Joint Staff. DJC2 will be a key enabler of the Joint Functional Concepts described in Joint Operational Concepts, November 2003.  It will provide the necessary C2 capabilities for a JTF HQ to handle the full Range of Military Operations (ROMO), as discussed in JROCM 023-3, Interim Range of Military Operations, 28 January 2003.  It will be the first system to meet the Joint, Multinational, and Interagency interoperability challenges described in An Evolving Joint Perspective: US Joint Warfare and Cross Resolution, 28 January 2003, endorsed by JROCM 022-03, 28 January 2003. Increment II will be defined by Increment II Capabilities Development Document (CDD) – refer to Supplemental Information posted to the DJC2 website https://www.djc2.org/industry.  The primary capabilities satisfied by DJC2 include supporting Joint Task Force (JTF)/Regional Combatant Commanders (RCC) operations by providing a standard consolidated capability set, through modular configurations.  DJC2 enhances an RCC’s ability to rapidly activate and deploy a JTF with a command package that can sustain operations for days or weeks, support efficient routing of distributed C2 through collaborative network, and decrease the lag between deployment and full operational capabilities.   DJC2 provides a modular and rapidly reconfigurable suite of hardware (e.g. laptops, computer terminals, servers and peripherals), networking (routers, switches, cables, and security components), supporting infrastructure (e.g. power, environmental control units (ECU), shelters, furniture), and mobility components (e.g. containers, transit cases, limited ground transportation, and pallets).  It also provides limited organic en route and rapid response kit communications capabilities, different employment configurations of C2 capabilities, and supporting data systems.  Increment II configuration options include:  ·	En route for situational awareness with limited C2 capability ·	Rapid Response Kit using reachback with a light system capable of being transported by one or two persons on commercial or military aircraft  ·	Core to provide JTF C2 capability (core can subdivide into two separate deployable units of unspecified size to support split-based operations.  .  		 Acquisition Strategy.   The DJC2 employs an evolutionary acquisition strategy that will be implemented in three distinct increments, using spiral development.  Each increment is self-contained, targets a specific set of user requirements, and delivers multiple releases of increasing functional capabilities.  Each DJC2 increment also includes a number of spirals.  A spiral release consists of functional capability additions/enhancements and/or changes in the underlying system infrastructure.  Spiral releases may also include changes in system hardware and software architecture, including technology update.  Development for the increment ends with the fielding decision for the last scheduled spiral release.   Increment I is a transformational increment, providing five spiral releases over the FY04 through FY07 timeframe.  The Increment I systems includes a non-deployable JFCOM Core configuration system to support experimentation, CONOPs development and as feasible, developmental and operational testing.  Increment I systems also include two deployable Core configurations for each of the RCCs designated to receive DJC2 systems.  Deployable Core configurations will also include limited organic communications capabilities supporting en route and early entry operations. Increment I is migrating toward the DoD Net Centric and Global Information Grid-Enterprise Services (GIG-ES) architectures.  Due to the urgent need for this system, NSWC PC is serving as the systems integrator for Increment I to allow maximum flexibility and responsiveness.   Increment II is a transitional increment:  DJC2 will transition from Global Command and Control System Joint (GCCS-J), providing core C2 for Increment I, to Joint Command and Control (JC2) as software becomes available.  Increment II is envisioned to deliver two additional Cores to each RCC beginning in FY08.   Statement of Objectives.  The main goal of the DJC2 Increment II program is to create a cost-effective, superior means to deploy, setup, install, operate, and maintain a Joint Command and Control (C2) Combat Operations Center (COC) infused with the latest advanced technology in order to improve the ability of Joint Task Force/Joint Force Commanders to provide C2 functions by equipping them with core, tested C2 applications and collaboration tools.  A principal objective of the DJC2 Increment II program is to optimize system performance while reducing system footprint to ensure faster time to field through increased concurrency.   The Milestone B SD&D effort will focus on:   	(1) Leveraging new technologies and prototype designs successfully demonstrated during the pre-Milestone B Technology Risk Reduction effort for Rapid Response Kit design and prototyping, as well as identifying additional proven concepts, strategies and technologies that will meet Increment II system performance requirements. 	(2) Reducing integration and production risk through the development of a robust system design that meets or exceeds CDD requirements, includes sufficient modularity and expandability to allow for incremental inclusion of future requirements as technology upgrades over the system service life, and supports commonality of architecture, configuration, and equipment to reduce overall life cycle costs.    Development and demonstration will be aided by an efficient test and evaluation program.  Requested Input from Industry.    Industry is strongly encouraged to submit information to the DJC2 Joint Program Office (JPO) via email at steven.grant@navy.mil and theodore.hynson@navy.mil.   All responses shall be limited to less than 10 normal type (10 pitch or greater) and size pages (8.5” by 11”) and are required by 29 July 2005.  Requested information includes but is not limited to:  1.  Propose alternative contract strategies and business models, including the following:  a.	Pros and Cons of single/multiple contractor(s) as Systems Integrator (SI).  b.	Innovative contract approaches that address the JPO’s desire to: (1) integrate pre-Milestone B efforts into the SD&D effort; (2) foster open architecture; (3) conduct additional rapid prototyping as necessary; and (4) provide for future technology re-fresh/insertion.  c.	Show why your alternative/approach provides value to the DoD.  This is best done by proven benchmarks and metrics, where you can demonstrate achieving the required performance for the minimum amount of dollars.  d.	Government/Industry Partnering.  2.  Response to any or all of the following questions:  a.	As a corporation, how would you support the transition of SI work from the government to industry?    b.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing/Instrumentation Division, Edwards AFB, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing 4 each MIDS flight recorders to support the F 16 program.

The following is a description of the flight recorders:  The Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) Flight Recorder connects directly to the Support Port of the MIDS terminal without the need for a device to convert from the terminal's AUI format to Ethernet.  In addition to recording all transmitted and received messages, the Support Port records data not normally available on the 1553 bus including transmissions originated by the terminal such as its own PPLI, Initial Entry messages, machine receipts, and relayed messages, as well as navigation performance data, signal quality measurements, and digitized voice. In addition to the AUI interface, the Flight Recorder includes two 1 PPS timing signals inputs.  The  fractional difference between these is periodically measured and recorded to facilitate correlating Link-16 data (time-tagged with JTIDS network time) with TSPI data (time-tagged with GPS UTC time).  The recorded data is stored on removable Compact Flash.  A software utility package is included which allows the Test Analyst to specify exactly what data is to be recorded (FIMs, FOMs, DTBs, IDBs) without impacting the mission computer.  This software package also includes data extraction routines to support analysis of the recorded data.  The Flight Recorder requires 28V aircraft power, weighs less than 5 lbs, draws less than 5 amps, and meets the following environmental specifications:
 
Operating temperature	-20°C to +71°C
Non-Operating Storage temperature	-40°C to +71°C
Humidity	100% relative humidity, with condensation
Altitude	50,000 ft.
Explosive Atmosphere	50,000 ft per MIL-STD-810 method 511.3 Procedure I

<DESC>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION #RFI05000009.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) plans to implement a new core financial management capability and related administrative functions using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software packages at an approved hosting facility, i.e. Center of Excellence. 

Accordingly, by this Request for Information (RFI) FCC is surveying the commercial marketplace and other sources of off-the-shelf software and hosting support for entities that can provide both JFMIP compliant financial management Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and hosting services.  The information will be used exclusively by FCC support staff to assist in systems acquisition planning. Commercial software for which FCC is seeking information includes Core Accounting (general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, cost accounting, asset management, and cost management), as well as information on reporting, budget formulation and execution, obligation processing; expenditure tracking; cash management; workflow automation, Procurement; Purchase Orders/Small Purchases; Contracts; Executive Information System; Expendable Inventory Supply (acquisitions and issues); and Training Requests. The COTS software at a minimum will need to interface with eTravel, Treasury, Payroll, a standard budget system, a budget execution and management system, banking and loan service providers, and subsidiary applications.  In addition, the COTS software must have the capability of operating in a mixed financial management software environment, be able to be implemented in a phased approach, and be scalable. 

GOALS - FCC's goal in implementing these systems include: (1) Integration and standardization of data and systems across all FCC offices. (2) Providing management with access to timely and accurate financial, budget, asset and related information on programs and projects. (3) Implementation of advanced technology to provide the greatest capability and an extended life cycle. 

SCOPE - These systems will be used to support all FCC's field installations and headquarters and for the management of FCC's budgetary appropriation of approximately $ 300 million per year. 

ENVIRONMENT - All FCC facilities are interconnected via a high-speed computer network that is a part of the Internet. FCC maintains its own backbone network based on the TCP/IP protocol and having direct links to local area networks at each field location. It should be assumed that any FCC employee using these applications would be equipped with a personal computer (IBM compatible) and a local area network connection providing connectivity to any other FCC location. 

SURVEY OBJECTIVES - Objectives of this survey include obtaining an understanding of and making assessments about appropriate COTS application software and hosting services with respect to: 
	I. Currently available and planned future functional capabilities in the near term (2-3 years) in the areas of, Business processes supported; Application capabilities and; Human engineering and usability testing applied; If multiple architectures are offered provide information on functional (application) differences, for instance, between vendor's mainframe and client/server-based systems. 
	II. Will current application software capabilities pass independent third party testing for compliance with Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) requirements? 
	III. Currently available technology and planned technology capabilities in the near term (2-3 years): 
A. Fundamental technologies employed, including but not limited to: - Client/server architecture; - Graphical User 	Interface (GUI) and development tools; - Electronic Data Interchange (EDI; - Electronic Commerce (EC); - Digital signatures; - Security (data and system); - Object capabilities (language, database, architecture (CORBA). 
B. Support for and compliance with standards: - X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 4; Structured Query 	Language (SQL); - Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA); - TCP/IP; - any others utilized. 
C. Scalability: The degree to which the systems support workgroup operations and how they scale to support enterprise wide data integration and retrieval. 
D. Implementation Environment: - Computer platform requirements; - Operating system requirements; - Database requirements (vendors, types, structure, etc.); - Application language(s); - Application structure, integration, etc.; - Data query, download/upload capabilities. 	
E. Architecture: What architecture options are available for implementing your application in the FCC environment? Does it support a distributed environment? F. What Centers of Excellence currently host, or in 	the near future (2-3 years) will host this COTS software? 
	IV. Business/Other: Identify potential for on-line Internet access to application software and a test data base at vendor's own facility; Status and readiness of software or planned readiness dates for future capabilities; At least 3 financial COTS customer references with contact names and telephone numbers; company qualifications, financials, history with core financial COTS installations. 

FCC is restricting its survey to the list of ERP packages as identified on the Financial Management Systems Software (FMSS) schedule. FCC is seeking comprehensive information for planning purposes. Responses are requested if you can provide: Any part of the relevant applications; tools for system integration, or tools for use in data conversion. It is requested that this information be submitted no later than July 28, 2005, in the form of a "white paper", limited to no more than 20 pages in length. Additional JFMIP responses, informational brochures or user manuals are needed if available. User Manuals and other documentation are not subject to the 20-page limitation. Any material submitted will not be returned. It is requested that the white paper be submitted electronically via CD for IBM compatible PCs using Microsoft Office 2000 compatible/readable products. FCC reserves the right to contact vendors, to provide clarifications on capabilities or to ask questions. Submissions should mailed to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Office of the Managing Director, Contracts Purchasing Center, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20554, Attention: Wilma Mooney, Room 1-A660.  Please note that due to security measures hand deliveries will not be accepted.  Individual responses should indicate whether they are a large, small, small disadvantaged, disabled veteran or women-owned business. FCC shall not assume any expenses incurred by any of the respondents to this RFI. This is not a Request For Proposal. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes only.

<SUBJECT>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) - Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Neutralizer
<DESC>This BAA is part a multi-phase program to detect, classify and neutralize moored and bottom mines in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) environment using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV).  Existing Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems place man, mammal, and expensive manned systems (helicopters and ships) in a hazardous environment. Currently no unmanned system exists to neutralize mines in the VSW; the unmanned underwater vehicle neutralizer (UUV-N) will be developed as part of the Naval Special Clearance Team ONE (NSCT-1) VSW toolbox capability. The Naval Surface Warfare Center – Panama City (NSWC-PC) is seeking information on commercially available, or developmental projects related to small (i.e. capable of being moved and/or deployed by no more than two men) unmanned underwater vehicle mine neutralization (UUV-N) systems, equipment and technologies suitable for mine neutralization missions deployed by small craft in the Very Shallow Water (VSW) zone (10-40 feet water (FSW)). Specific areas of technical interest include but are not limited to:  1. Advanced Sensors for Precise Target Reacquisition in Surge Environment; 2. Countercharge Station Keeping in Surge Environment; 3. Neutralization by Overpressure; 4. UUV Precise Autonomous Guidance to Target Positions; 5. Long Range Command Activation or Communication in Active Surf Conditions; 6. Enhanced Explosive Devices for Neutralizing Influence Mines; 7. UUV Design and Control in Surge Environment; 8. Hydrodynamic Models for Characterization of the VSW Zone; 9. RF  Data Links and Data Management Techniques. Descriptive information is sought in the form of white papers, brochures, specification sheets, briefings and company points of contact. Also of interest are concepts based on existing equipment or proven technologies that are planned to become available in the 2005/2007 timeframe. Limited funding is available for design proposals and demonstrations. Firms should indicate any interest or willingness to provided technology or system demonstrations when responding.  An Industry Day will be held at the Navy Memorial in Washington DC on 19 July 2005. Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate the development of a future competitive solicitation for an acquisition program in late FY 06. Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Attendance at the Industry Awareness Day is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Seating is limited.  Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, Address, Telephone Number, and e-mail address not later than 8 July 2005.

(The LabVIEW code associated with each measurement will be referred to as a “LabVIEW measurement module”.) The suite shall consist of a main graphical user interface (GUI) from which operators can enter unique identifiers for each radio as well as test parameters and select the appropriate LabVIEW measurement modules to execute. The selected modules shall then run largely unattended in batch mode.  The following work tasks shall be required:
1.	Work in cooperation with electronics engineers and technicians at ITS to develop written descriptions of the testing algorithms for inclusion in the “Measurement Processes and Procedures” document which is required for laboratory accreditation.
2.	Provide technical direction and guidance for three existing ITS LabVIEW programmers through assistance in the development of the test suite architecture.
3.	Automate a minimum of four LabVIEW measurement modules:
a.	Prepare written documentation of methods and algorithms employed in each LabVIEW measurement module per the guidelines established by the LabVIEW programmers committee at ITS.
b.	Create the necessary LabVIEW interfaces to extract test parameters from a common, main Graphical User Interface (GUI) which will be used to collect global test parameters.
c.	Design and create Microsoft Access data tables to store measurement data.
d.	Create the necessary SQL code which when executed via the LabVIEW ODBC Connectivity Toolkit shall successfully write data to the appropriate Microsoft Access data tables.
e.	Prepare written documentation of measurement test plans for each LabVIEW measurement module per the guidelines established by the LabVIEW programmers committee at ITS.
f.	Using at least three different models of Project 25 radio, validate the proper operation of the LabVIEW measurement modules.
g.	Demonstrate the proper operation of each LabVIEW measurement following integration into the test suite.
All radio test conditions and results shall be written to a Microsoft Access database. The LabVIEW measurement modules developed in this effort shall all use commands dynamically retrieved from a Microsoft Access database to control test equipment via the GPIB interface. All software shall be developed per ITS internal standards using object-oriented methods.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

This is Solicitation No. AB133C-05-RP-1208 and is issued as a Request for Proposals.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.  

This is a notice to all offerors that this solicitation is 100% set aside for small business.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334112 and the corresponding size standard is 1,000 employees.  

1.0 Statement of Work
The Office of Coast Survey requires a precise navigation system for its existing Hydroid REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to continue evaluating the vehicle as an effective tool for hydrographic surveying.   The navigation system should include WAAS-enabled GPS and inertial navigation (INS) integrated into the vehicle and a WAAS-enabled GPS equipped acoustic positioning buoy system.

1.1 Background
The Coast Survey Development Lab Hydrographic Systems and Technology Programs is testing the use of  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) for use as a tool to conduct hydrographic surveys to augment the existing NOAA fleet of hydrographic survey ships and launches.  In FY04 a Hydroid REMUS AUV was purchased through a competitive process by OCS in partnership with NMAO to serve as a test and evaluation vehicle.  

Phase 1 testing of the vehicle was performed by OCS personnel during the FY04 field season (June-September 2004).  The primary goal of the testing was to build operational expertise with an AUV.  A secondary goal was to evaluate the accuracy of the vehicle’s navigation system for conformance to standards required for operational surveys.  The Phase 1 test results proved the viability of AUV’s as potential tools for hydrographic surveying.  However, the initial testing revealed that the navigation systems, as originally specified and accepted, would not meet operational requirements for hydrographic side scan sonar surveys (detection and positioning of a 1 cubic meter cubic target within 10 meters accuracy).

AUV’s are an emerging and rapidly developing technology, and in the time since the vehicle was specified and purchased significant improvements to AUV navigation and positioning have become available.  Specifically, the addition of GPS and an inertial navigation system (INS) to the REMUS AUV, along with the addition of GPS to the acoustic positioning buoys should increase the navigational accuracy sufficiently for OCS to continue its evaluation of this technology as a survey tool.

2.0 Objectives
NOAA requires that the existing Hydroid REMUS AUV (S/N 241) be upgraded as follows:

•	Integration of a WAAS enabled GPS receiver into the vehicle’s body and navigation system to allow for accurate positioning of the vehicle while on the surface to update the navigation solution of other onboard sensors, including acoustic navigation and Inertial Navigation System.

•	Modification of the vehicle’s end-cap to allow for integration of new sensors via guest ports.

•	Upgrade of existing Paradigm buoy acoustic positioning system to Gateway buoy system, including addition of WAAS-enabled GPS and acoustic communications on each of two buoys.  This will facilitate the accurate positioning of the acoustic navigation reference buoys and allow for the AUV’s navigation information to relayed back to the monitoring vessel via acoustic modem and radio.

•	Integration of an Inertial Navigation System (INS) into the vehicles navigation system.  This will allow the vehicle to accurately navigate between acoustic or GPS position updates.

•	Delivery of the modified vehicle will be no later than 6 weeks after the successful offeror receives the order and NOAA’s REMUS AUV.

Additionally, NOAA requires training on the new systems at the manufacturer’s facility to ensure correct and effective use and maintenance.  Training should be conducted concurrent with the delivery of the modified vehicle.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being accepted. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), intends to award multiple firm fixed-price purchase orders to contractors whose quotations are determined to provide the best value to the government. Description: Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), the United States Department of Energy (DOE) is required to develop a repository for the disposal of 70,000 MTHM (metric tons of heavy metal) of radioactive waste in the form of commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF), DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste (HLW).  DOEâ€™s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is responsible for the development of the repository and for the transportation of all designated CSNF and HLW from commercial utilities and DOE sites to the repository.  Upon receiving construction authorization from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the OCRWM will begin constructing a Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) at Yucca Mountain on the Nevada Test Site (NTS).  The MGR will be regulated in accordance with 10 CFR 63. Part of the national inventory of CSNF expected to be delivered to Yucca Mountain will have a thermal output that exceeds the current limit for immediate emplacement.  Consequently, CSNF that exceeds the thermal limit for emplacement will need to be aged at Yucca Mountain to allow its heat output to decay. The DOE is considering aging CSNF in currently licensed commercial vertical cask (casks may include canisters) systems and horizontal storage (aging) modules.  These casks and modules may require design modifications to satisfy Yucca Mountain site-specific requirements. These commercial systems are presently certified to 10 CFR Part 72.  Technical basis reviews and analyses are necessary to compare performance of casks licensed under 10 CFR 72 to Yucca Mountain site-specific hazards and their ability to comply with the requirements of 10 CFR 63.  These reviews shall include, but not be limited to, engineering calculations and analyses of criticality, shielding, structural, containment (per the 10 CFR 63.2 definition), and thermal performance of the currently licensed casks.  Also included shall be the results/consequences of any cask tip over or slap-down analysis. This scope of work contains information to be used to prepare:  1) An Operational Performance Report describing how the currently licensed casks/modules meet or could meet the operational performance objectives in Table 4-1 (attached) including the technical basis supporting the performance, as well as engineering calculations and analyses and,  2) An Environmental and External Event Report describing how the overall performance of currently licensed casks/modules meet or could meet the Yucca Mountain site-specific environmental and external hazard events in Table 4-2 (attached) including the technical basis supporting the performance, as well as engineering calculations and analyses. Additional analyses deemed necessary will be requested on a task order basis under this contract. Minimum Mandatory Requirements:  DOE will only consider award to contractors who have developed storage cask systems that have been certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under 10 CFR Part 72. Questions/Comments:  Questions/comments must be received through the IIPS web site no later than July 1, 2005.  Submission of quotations by means other IIPS is not authorized. Acquisition Procedures:  This acquisition will be conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.

FAR Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items applies:   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

Factor 1:  Technical Capability.  Factor 2:  Past Performance.  Factor 3:  Demonstration of Software Capability.  Technical Evaluation Factors (taken in their entirety) are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful offeror.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   Technical Factor 1 shall be evaluated according to following adjectival scale:  Excellent, Vendor’s proposal is complete and thorough.   To receive this rating, vendor meets or exceeds mandatory requirements with little or no perceived risk.   Example:  Vendor provides additional functional capabilities and/or training, and/or helpdesk services not identified in the  mandatory requirements cited above.  There are no weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Good, Substantial response to each of the areas.    Vendor’s product meets mandatory requirements described above.  There are no significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Average:  Vendor’s proposal is responsive to requirements. It may be weak in substantiation of information or data presented.  There may be one or more significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.  Poor: A proposal may receive a rating of Poor for any of the following reasons:  Displays only a limited capability to meet requirements; lacks essential information to substantiate claims/data presented; or proposal omits required and pertinent information in major areas.  Technical Factor 2:  Past Performance.  The Offeror must provide a Project Profile for at least 3 projects.  Each Project Profile must represent work completed within the past 24 months.  Minimally acceptable information includes:  Name, Address, Telephone Number and Customer Point of Contact;  Type of Customer (i.e., Federal Government, State/Local Government, or Commercial/Private Organization). Contract Number (if applicable).  Total value of the Contract at time of Contract Award and Total Value of the Contract at time of Completion (value to date if an active contract).  Provide a brief summary of the causes for any increase/decrease in contract value. Required Delivery Schedule/Period of Performance and Actual Delivery Schedule/Period of Performance.  Description of services offered.  The Offeror shall note that the Government may consider all information available on the Offeror’s experience and past performance.  This may include information that is in addition to that which is provided to the Offeror.  The Government may also consider information available to it through Government records, industry databases (e.g., Dunn an Bradstreet), and other sources.    Technical Factor 2 shall be evaluated according to the following adjectival scale:  Excellent:  All survey responses were positive with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction.  All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates no risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Good:  All survey responses were positive with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction.  Any concerns were minimal or isolated and were satisfactorily addressed by the vendor (in follow-up).  All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Neutral:  No Prior Past Performance.  Average:  At least two of the three survey responses were marginal or unsatisfactory with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction, and/or overall performance.  The offeror experienced periodic problems and/or was not consistently proactive in addressing issues or concerns.  Some references not as likely to return to the vendor to satisfy future requirements.  Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based on the Offeror’s past performance.  Poor:  The Offeror’s past experiences are extremely weak, and/or inaccurate, and/or incomplete.  There is insufficient evidence to show that the contractor could perform the requirements of the SOW.  There are significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Factor 3:  The Government shall require a Demonstration of Software Capability from the most highly qualified vendors.  The Demonstration shall take place at the Government work location at 1901 South Bell Street, Arlington, VA.  The Demonstration of Software Capability shall be consistent with the information provided in the Technical Proposal.  The Demonstration shall begin with a 10-minute introduction of all parties.

(c) Program Plan:  Describe in detail the planned technical approach and how the approach will be executed.  (d) Rough Order of Magnitude Cost Estimate (ROM).  Page Limitations.  The technical papers shall be limited to 15 pages, single-spaced, 1-inch margins, double-sided, 8.5 by 11-inch pages.  Select an easy to read font no smaller than 12 pitch fixed or proportional font size 10 or larger.  Smaller type may be used in figures and tables as long as it is clearly legible.  The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  Multiple technical papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror.  The purpose of the technical paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those technical papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission.  The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds.  The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.    The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal,  (2) Importance to Space Control Technology programs, and (3) Affordability.  Price, in the context of affordability of proposals versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and negotiated on proposals selected for award.  No further evaluation criteria will be used. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY06.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SMC/SYK, Los Angeles AFB, CA:  Capt. Mia Kinsey, phone (310) 416-1728, email mia.kinsey@losangeles.af.mil or information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The work to be performed may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability, therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at time of award. BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Director of Staff, SMC/DS, phone number (310) 363-3571.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting manager, Capt. Mia Kinsey (310) 416-1728.  This BAA will remain open for 12 months from the date of publication or until replaced by a successor BAA, whichever is first.  There is no guarantee that awards will be made in each of the identified technical areas.  The Government may make multiple awards in a technical area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and the available funding.  While technical papers will be accepted at any time during the fiscal year, proposals received later in the fiscal year have a greater risk of not being funded due to unavailability of funds.  Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the government.

<DESC>Organ Donor Transplantation Education Initiative 	Questions & Answers 1.	 Question:  What is the NAICS code/size standard/set-aside (if any) for this procurement?  Answer:  The NAICS code is 813920 and Size Standard is $6M and is not a set-aside.  This is the second competition.  The previous proposals we received through e-buy (GSA) were found to have inadequate technical expertise for this requirement.   2.	Question:  Is the overall communication objective of the DVD and self-learning module the same as the manual? In other words, are the multimedia materials a visual version of the manual?   Answer: Yes, it will contain the same information, but would be in the form of Power Point presentations, questions and answers, slide library on a CD. The DVD would contain a talk or lecture by an expert. 3.	Question:  Is it necessary for the manual content to be created and approved before work can begin on production of the multimedia elements?           Answer: Yes, the content would have to go through an approval process.  4.	Question:  In order to accurately cost for a Firm Fixed Price, how many DVD projects are expected to be created as part of this project?  Is new video footage to be shot?  If a video is to be created, what is the anticipated length of the video? Answer: We expect to have one DVD that will contain a talk (lecture) by an expert in this field lasting about 45 minutes. This could be changed per the suggestion of the contractor if needed for the comprehensiveness of the project. 5.	Question:  Is duplication of the DVDs required? Answer: Yes. 6.	Question:  Is the self-directed learning module intended to be delivered in a CD-ROM format or as an Internet-based interactive product? Answer:  CD format 7.	Question:  If the self-learning module is an Internet-based product, will the government license the learning content management system necessary for delivery?  Answer: It will not be an Internet -based product. 8.	Question:  Is contractor responsible for identifying and coordinating the organization/university that provides the CME's? Answer: No. 9.	Question:  Is there an incumbent for this contract?  Answer: No 10.	Will a contractor's proven knowledge about, and experience with, the topics of organ donation and transplantation be given weight in the award of this contract? Answer: Yes.  11.	Under the objective the following is listed:  "to develop a manual with multidimensional educational materials that can be distributed nationally to training programs for physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, physician's assistants, and nurse practitioners in hospital and university settings" 	Additionally, others are listed including "	DoT's yield collaborative, "	ICU/CCU physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, "	trauma center/emergency department physicians, nurses, and emergency department personnel such as paramedics and EMTs (emergency medical technicians), "	organ procurement organizations (OPO) and their staff. Should the level of effort produce material targeted for each profession separately or should the deliverable be written more generally so that the level of comprehension will be maximized across all groups? 	Answer:  The manual will be written for the physician level with the understanding that the other health professions would be working in this field (ICU setting or in relation to the ICU setting) and have experience that would help in their comprehension of the material presented.  12.	Under section 4.0 - Specific Task 4.4; Regarding the level of detail for each chapter, is the intent of the Organ Specific Content Chapters to be an overview each organ and the major factors involved with transplantation with each or to go further into a more medical procedural manual approach? "	4.4 The contractor shall assign chapters to authors and assure that chapters are integrated into the manual format. Answer:  The organ specific content would discuss the major factors involved in maintaining the viability of specific organs for transplantation and would include an overview of the organ and factors involved in transplantation.  13.	 Under section 4.8, listed below, the scope includes presentation material.  How many hours should the presentation be? How long or how many questions should the self-learning module be? "	4.8 The contractor shall assign editors/authors and others with appropriate expertise to develop the laminated card and prepared presentations which shall include: prepared narrative, general overview video/DVD presentation, and self-learning modules (with education credit - CME, CEU, CEPTC) which is based on the approved content. Answer:  The presentations that would accompany each chapter would be 45 minutes to an hour. The number of questions would be decided in relation to the materials presented. Twenty questions could be an average but this is not written in stone. 14.	For section 4.8, listed above, website/ online self-learning is not listed above.  Would online self-learning module be an acceptable approach in addition to the items listed above?  This may aide in reporting results of this effort by having online registration and tracking of education credits, which would allow your organization to provide additional evidence for the Department's Program Assessment Resource Tool (PART) efforts.  Answer:  Online learning modules are not a part of this RFQ, but could be considered in the future.  15.	An important part of evaluating a potential bid, is identifying the potential for some measure of profit.  In the likely case that the budget for the project will not be released for this question can you please provide a range? i.e.  Would the anticipated the level of effort for this scope reasonably produce a potential range of cost between $250,000 and $500,000?  As you understand, the costs associated with putting a proposal together are substantial we would like some indication of budgetary consideration for the project. Answer:  Can not provide any comment on this question.   16.	The results of these questions will greatly assist us with providing a responsive bid.  Of concern is the proposed proposal due date of June 30, 2005.  Will you consider extending the due date by two weeks from issuance of the Answers to these questions?  A proposed due dated of July 14, 2005 should provide sufficient time to incorporate and modify proposals to provide the responsive bids.  Answer:  We will consider looking at an extension of the due date and the justifications proposed for the extension, but can't promise an extension at this time.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Facilities Operator/Animal Caretaker

Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit

The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit's ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. Below are some items that have been identified that would facilitate the agent's ability to remain in the field to perform his/her duties in support of the Border Patrol's mission.  Employing a contractor would be more cost effective in maintaining the facility and the horses.  This would allow the agents to dedicate a greater majority of their time in the field by eliminating the requirement to have agents maintain the facility and the horses.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide a facility operator/animal caretaker service at the specified site. A contractor would also be responsible for providing a minimum of disability insurance and other benefits, as prescribed by the U.S. Department of Labor, to the employees. A minimum of two (02) operator/caretakers is required to maintain coverage throughout the entire week.  This will also cover for holidays, sick days and vacation time for the contract employees.  

Contract employees would be available during daylight hours in order to facilitate other businesses such as farrier services, veterinary services and other responsibilities as dictated by the unit supervisor.

Facility Operator/Animal Caretaker:

·	Facility operator(s)/animal caretaker(s) must perform all work in person and on-site (individuals will work 8 hours per day/ 7 days per week and be capable of performing services on a "flex-schedule" to accommodate varying horse patrol work shifts)

·	Be physically present for all contracted services being performed (i.e. veterinary, farrier service)

·	Clean/maintain corral area and stalls/tack room/storage area daily (to include feed bins and water troughs, and removal of manure from the premises)

·	Perform tack maintenance to insure that all equipment is clean and serviceable

·	Maintain a daily log of all prescribed services and activities and report any abnormalities to the horse patrol supervisor or agent-in-charge

·	Responsible for cleaning of Horse Patrol Fleet, which includes vehicles and trailers (individual is not authorized to operate patrol vehicles)

·	Feed horses daily (twice) as prescribed by the unit's feeding/nutrition schedule.

·	Groom/wash horses to maintain a clean coat as needed.

·	Treat/clean minor abrasions/galls as needed.

·	Horses not being used for patrol duty will be removed from stalls and put into a designated exercise area.

·	All horses will be returned to their stalls at the end of the day

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence or carelessness of the facility operator/animal caretaker.  The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence or carelessness on a case-by-case basis.

(2)	Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.

HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 30) CLAUSES

3052.209-70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

	                           					  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Farrier Services
Douglas Station Mounted Horse Patrol Unit

The Mounted Horse Patrol Unit of the Douglas Station currently has twenty-one (21) horses assigned to it.  As such, caring for the horses, maintaining the facilities and having agents available for farrier services has become very expensive and taxing on the unit’s ability to maintain the maximum number of agents in the field to perform their official duties. 

The station does not currently have a designated or contracted farrier to provide shoeing for the horses in the remuda.  Employing a contractor would eliminate the need for the unit supervisor to seek out a farrier every five to eight weeks to shoe the station’s horses.  A contract farrier would be held accountable for a guarantied work product whereas a non-contract farrier limits his work to a very limited guaranty and would most likely charge a mileage fee to refit a shoe.  A disadvantage noted in soliciting a different farrier every shoeing cycle is that the farrier does not have the opportunity to “learn” each horse and become familiar with its shoeing needs.  This lends itself to many an animal becoming lame, thus being placed out of service until it heals.  Some injuries due to lameness can permanently disable an animal, costing the agency in veterinary services and ultimately having to replace the animal.

The advantages to having a contract farrier is that he/she would become familiar with each of the animals and have an understanding of each of their shoeing needs.  A contract farrier would be required to comply with standards established by the agency or risk losing the contract award.

A contractor would be responsible for providing all labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, training, and transportation in order to provide services at a specified site. 

The following are minimum requirements for farrier services:

Farrier:

·	Shoe horses every five to eight weeks by certified farrier. (Farrier should possess a certificate from a recognized Farrier Training Facility)

·	If  a shoe is lost – replacement will be in a timely manner (within 24 hours)

·	The farrier shall perform his/her work between the hours of 7:00am – 5:00pm, Monday through Friday.

·	Shall correct any discrepancies noted, as directed by the COTR, within a three day period after receipt of services at no additional cost to the Government

·	Shall maintain an approved Hoof Management and Maintenance Schedule (Final approval on any maintenance schedule shall be approved by the unit supervisor.)

·	Shall have a minimum of three years experience at a journeyman level and be in compliance with all applicable state and local regulations

Note:
(1)	Vendor is responsible for any costs or damages suffered to the Government (i.e. veterinary costs, etc) that is a result of negligence within a two-day period after Farrier service. The COTR and the Contracting Officer will determine negligence.

(2)	Locations may be changed, added or deleted throughout the contract period.
