<DESC>The Augusta VAMC, Columbia VAMC, Atlanta VAMC and Central Alabama Health Care System have a requirement for the full installation and activation of a diverse entrance of telecommunications services.  This diverse entrance is designed to protect the current services from interruptions due to infrastructure damage.

This will provide continued telephone service in the event of an emergency and uninterrupted delivery of quality patient care to the veterans and family members being served by these facilities. This will be a sole source acquisition. Justification: Only one responsible source as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, (b), (3).  All telecommunications infrastructure coming into the medical centers is owned and maintained by Bell South.

..........STATEMENT OF WORK..........

A contractor is needed to support the NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Southeast Region Habitat Conservation Division’s (NOAA/NMFS/HCD) activities in the review of the economic impacts of human activities such as the open loop liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects on marine fishery resources of the Gulf of Mexico. 

Background

The NOAA/NMFS/NOAA/NMFS/HCD is responsible for the conservation, protection, and restoration of living marine resources of the Gulf of Mexico.  Our review of projects focuses primarily on identifying measures to avoid and minimize adverse impacts of development activities.  Recently, we have been involved extensively in the review of LNG projects, proposed under the Deepwater Ports Act, and assessing the impacts of impingement and entrainment of fish eggs and larvae from the intake of seawater used to regasify LNG.  To date, we are aware of eight proposed and approved LNG projects that, cumulatively, would require over one billion gallons of seawater per day and would impact hundreds of billions of fish eggs and larvae.  While a methodology has been developed to measure the number or pounds of fishery resources impacted by some of the facilities, a companion methodology to evaluate economic costs resulting from the destruction of fishery resources is needed.  A contract under this statement of work would allow NOAA/NMFS/HCD to better address the scope of impacts associated with LNG operations in the Gulf of Mexico.  Products should be helpful as NOAA/NMFS/HCD considers the economic implications of other human activities with environmental implications.

Scope of Work

The objective of this contract is to provide both an assessment methodology for, and a fishery economic impact evaluation of, existing and proposed open loop LNG facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, with application in other arenas. The methodology and impact assessments must be based on sound and accepted economic principles, using published literature and other appropriate references, expert opinion, and other available information.  The products of this endeavor would be 1) a model or methodology which could be applied to existing and future projects which might entrain or impinge marine fishery resources and 2) an economic evaluation of the potential fishery impacts of the licensed and proposed LNG projects in the Gulf of Mexico.  This project is intended to address issues specific to the southeastern United States, but the development of a methodology should consider possible applicability to other regions of the country.

Tasks/Deliverables: 

Task 1. Compile relevant literature and information on use and non-use valuations of marine fishery resources and the application of economic theory to assess the impacts of fishery production foregone as a result of LNG induced mortality.  Limited literature research is necessary only to the degree that it would be sufficient for the development of the impact methodology.

Task 2. Design an impact assessment model or methodology in an accessible and user-friendly format to provide a tool that can be used to quantify the economic impacts of entrainment and impingement on living marine resources of the Gulf of Mexico.  The methodology should be sufficiently robust to allow the substitution of various values based on new information or conditions in other regions of the country.  The final methodology should be provided to the NOAA/NMFS/HCD in a report format and, as appropriate, as a mathematical model.  The report should include citations, clear definitions of all assumptions, and recommendations for further study. 
 
Deliverable. Prepare a written report that analyzes the adverse economic impacts of the eight licensed and proposed open loop LNG facilities on living marine resources of the Gulf of Mexico.  Consider how model and economic impacts could be extrapolated to other types of human impacts. 

Period of Performance

The contractor shall complete the specified tasks within eleven months of contract award.  Estimated Direct Labor is approximately 800 hours.

 
Project Review

Monthly project progress review meetings or teleconferences between the contractor and the NOAA/NMFS/HCD contacts will be conducted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NRMT-5-052 is being issued as a Request for Quotation.  An award of a firm fixed price purchase order is planned.
PURPOSE:
The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) requires assistance in investigating the linkages among climate, air quality and human health issues in order to contribute to NOAA’s mission of understanding climate and its impacts on society and building more effective climate services for the nation.  In particular, NOAA is requesting the development of a database and associated analysis that will allow an integrated approach to analyzing climate, air quality, allergens, and human health over the past 15-20 years in the New England region.
BACKGRGOUND:
In recent years, researchers and stakeholders in the New England region of the United States have determined that one of the main barriers to developing a more detailed understanding of the links among climate, air quality, and human health is the lack of an extensive database that brings together a variety of air quality data (i.e., physical [meteorological variables], chemical [criteria and hazardous air pollutants], and biological [pollen and mold] and health effects data (e.g., mortality, hospital admissions, emergency room visits, physician visits).  They have also discovered that daily pollen data has not been collected or archived systematically and is therefore not readily available.  In order to investigate interannual climate variability and adverse human health effects, NOAA needs to support the development of a database of the related information that can allow integrated analysis and one that spans as many years as possible.
TASKS/ANALYSIS:
The contractor will address the following questions/issues and provide analysis thereof:
	1.  How do interannual climate variations influence air quality parameters in New 
	England?
2.  How do interannual climate variations influence pulmonary health in the northeast?
3.  Why does the demand for hospital respiratory services increase significantly in September?  How does it vary by year?
4.  What are the economic costs of air pollution?
Other Issues:  In addition to addressing these questions, the contractor will develop an integrated climate, air quality, allergen, and human health database, and develop a systematic pollen and mold monitoring network in New England to aid in the integrated analysis.  
Period of Performance: Thirteen (13) months from the effective date of award.  Study data completion will be June 30, 2006.  
DELIVERABLES:
A comprehensive final report will be delivered to the Government not later than 90 days after the study date completion.  Interested contractors are invited to submit a quote to address the above evaluation factors, to be received no later than September 7, 2005 at 2:30pm local time.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-5.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  'Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees - Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from  I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100  hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commerc ial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the ve hicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (nee ding greater than 12ft-5in clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guar d that their vehicle is over 12ft-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subc ontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane ex cept at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the  contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemen ted, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Cen ter Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.'  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  'a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any co ntract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitor's pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewi s more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitor's pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistic s Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitor's pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participat es in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history backgr ound check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHB C is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access iden tification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitor's pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Govern ment may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitor's pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge f or any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the  required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next workday.  An employee's inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/s he does not have the required identification badge or visitor's pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontr actors, or their employees.  If an employee's identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduct ion is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access id entification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government in stallation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the C ontracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.'  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  'In accordance with the FAR Part Two electr onic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.'
