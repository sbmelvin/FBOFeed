In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s). The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team. Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project. All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline in Japan.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract. Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains two (2) 12-month options with two one-year award term incentives. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of 1,000,000 yen is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD AT LEAST THREE CONTRACTS. THE OFFERORS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST RATED BEST VALUE PROPOSALS WILL BE AWARDED A CONTRACT WITH A MINIMUM GUARANTEE.  The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil on or about July 1, 2005. No hard copies will be provided.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, has a requirement to contract for the development and fabrication of a versatile, safe and environmentally friendly water-impact location identifier to serve the test and evaluation needs of advanced munitions development programs. This project, identified as the Soft Impact Location Capability (SILC), will provide a modular, portable system to support full-envelope testing of advanced ordnance systems using shallow water ocean impact areas in lieu of traditional land-impact ranges. This approach locates ordnance impact areas in modest water depths (12-100 meters) that enable post-test recovery of the projectiles.  System must support remote command and control of the system and data telemetry over distances out to 50 n. miles.  A single contract will be awarded for the delivery of a set of first article components, and then followed by the delivery of the production quantities.  Procurement History:  Using a spiral development process, two contracts were previously awarded under BAA-043338  September of 2004, to develop initial prototypes under the spiral 1 phase.  One contract was awarded to C&M Technology, Inc. of Old Saybrook, CT for $512,142 and the other contract was awarded to METOCEAN Data Systems Ltd. (MARTEC Group) of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada for $512,000.  Both of these contracts resulted in a sea-test demonstration of the respective prototype systems.  Under spiral-2 development, the new acquisition being advertised herein will identify additional enhancements and requirements beyond what has been previously demonstrated by either C&M or METOCEAN.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, will be conducting a pre-solicitation site visit for the New Visitor Center Construction and Paradise Inn Rehabilitation projects, Mount Rainier National Park, Washington. The National Park Service will be issuing a solicitation for proposals in mid-November 2005 for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below.  Funding is currently available. The National Park Service will be issuing a single solicitation for the two construction projects in the Paradise area of Mount Rainier National Park. This solicitation will be a full and open competition. Technical capability will include, but not limited to, experience in working in logistically challenging remote locations with short construction seasons. A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. Proposal submission will be in mid January 2006. Construction is anticipated to begin in early April 2006. Construction is presumed to extend for two construction seasons for both projects with a 545 calendar day time for completion. The combined value of the two projects is greater than $20 million. In order that interested parties may have a chance to visit the site before inclement weather, a Pre-Solicitation Site Visit and walk through is scheduled on Wednesday, October 26, 2005.  All interested parties are to meet in the lobby of the Paradise Inn, at 10:00 am on October 26, 2005.  Access to the existing building is restricted.

The title of this project is: New Visitor Center Construction and Paradise Inn Rehabilitation. The scope of work for this project consists of constructing a new visitor center and rehabilitation of the lodge. The Paradise area is part of the park-wide National Historic Landmark District. During construction, public access will be allowed in the Upper Paradise parking lot, the Ranger Station, Guide House, restrooms, and trailheads. This area is the most visited site within the Park. The Paradise Inn and Annex will be closed to the public during construction. The Paradise Inn and Annex may be used by the contractor for lodging during construction provided that appropriate safety measures are taken. NEW VISITOR CENTER AND ASSOCIATED SITE WORK The new Paradise visitor center (approximately 20,000 square feet) will be located on a new site, on the west end of the Upper Paradise parking lot. The new visitor center is concrete and steel framed with a metal roof, including visitor information area and lobby, auditorium, exhibit area, gift shop, and dining.  Other components of the project are a pedestrian plaza adjacent to the new visitor center and the Paradise Meadows and a redesigned parking and circulation configuration.  The existing Jackson Visitor Center will be demolished through a separate contract after the new visitor center is complete.   REHABLITATE PARADISE INN AND ANNEX The rehabilitation of the Paradise Inn and Annex will provide for seismic stability as well as accessibility and life-safety code compliance. The rehabilitation will include the construction of concrete shear walls, reinforcement and/or replacement of the stone rubble foundation, reconstruction of the stone chimneys, hazardous materials abatement, replacement of unrated partitions and doors with fire rated systems, and replacement of selected mechanical and plumbing systems. The Paradise Inn is a large four-story log and heavy timber frame structure. The original building was constructed in 1916. The Annex building was constructed in 1921. The Paradise Inn and Annex include 137 guest and staff rooms, a dining and kitchen wing, a lobby, gift shop, snack bar, and lounge.  The main building is 41,870 square feet in three stories and the Annex is 23,380 square feet in four stories, for a total of 65,250 gross square feet. The Paradise Inn and Annex are National Historic Landmarks.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for Class III Cultural Resource Inventory services in the BLM District Offices of Boise, Twin Falls, and Idaho Falls. BLM is required, under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, to take into account the effects of its actions on significant archaeological properties through a process of identification, evaluation, assessment of effects, and, if needed, mitigation.  Prior to any ground-disturbing activity, the BLM normally conducts a Class III (intensive) cultural resource inventory for the purpose of identifying and evaluating cultural resource sites which may be affected by the proposed action.  BLM cultural resource specialists can then use these evaluations, in combination with information gained through consultation with affected Tribes and the Idaho State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), to determine whether mitigation treatments are required for any site.  This requirement is unrestricted under NAICS 541690, and solicited per FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Supplies/Services.  BLM intends to evaluate technical, past performance, and price prior to making multiple award, firm fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery -Indefinite Quantity contracts. Future delivery orders issued against these contracts will be awarded on a best value basis.  The solicitation will be available on or about October 6, 2005.  Proposals will be due approximately three weeks from the date the solicitation is released.  Potential offerors may obtain a copy of the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov or http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Contractors must be registered at http//www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.   Questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, BLM Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528, or elaine_flick@blm.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The C-E LCMC Acquisition Center is seek sources on behalf of the PM Force Sustainment Systems and USA RDECOM, Command and Control Directorate, Army Power Division, Environmental System and Fuel Cell Branch to support the Armys Large Capacity Field H eater (LCFH) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program.  We are seeking information relating to industry interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/Product Support Provider in support of the LC FH PBL Program. The Government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for the LCFH.  The Government has not committed to PBL for the LCFH at this time.  IAW Army Regulation 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support;  reduction in the logistics footprint; and reduction in logistics costs.  The term PSI refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement.  Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the LCFH logistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General Support level maintenance through improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibil ity for all maintenance of the LCFH.  Sustainment training would be the contractors responsibility.

<DESC>•	JOINT MUNITIONS EFFECTIVENESS MANUALS (JMEMS). Sources are sought that have capabilities to prepare documents and electronic media products for publication and to conduct special research projects. This procurement will support the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME), a tri-service organization under direction of the Joint Logistics Commanders. Documents/products to be prepared for publication are technical handbooks and special publications. Preparation of these documents/products will require the contractor to: a. perform mathematical computations using existing computer models that have been authenticated and approved by the JTCG/ME, b. perform art and graphics work, c. prepare draft documents, d. edit documents, e. modify computer models, f. develop CD-ROM products that may be used to present data and calculate JMEM effectiveness data electronically, and g. sanitize electronic media products for release to foreign governments. The contractor will also be required to conduct research studies that are related to the publication of the technical handbooks. These research projects are initiated when data voids are discovered during document preparation. Examples of such research projects are: a. battlefield visibility due to smoke and dust; b. weather effects on battlefield visibility, and; c. reliability and maintainability of hydraulic systems on military vehicles. These special studies vary in duration and require experts with advanced degrees in specific fields of research. These fields include Engineering (Aeronautical, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil), Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics. The research tasks can be carried out at the contractor's facilities when in the best interest of the Government. Since many of the technical handbooks and CD-ROM products are already published, some of the work will consist of preparing revisions and/or updates. It is required that all revisions and/or updates be in the same format and of the same quality as original publications. These technical handbooks present weapon effectiveness data for air delivered and surface delivered weapons. These documents are generally referred to as the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs). The contractor shall be required to install JTCG/ME approved programs on the Government provided computer systems at Eglin AFB and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and to verify proper operation of these programs. The contractor may also be required to prepare and document computer models based upon mathematical models provided by the JTCG/ME and in some cases those developed by the munitions contractors. The contractor shall serve as custodian of all JTCG/ME computer models and all master copies of published documents. The contractor will be required to modify documents for release to foreign countries as directed by JTCG/ME. This work will usually require document editing and revising as specified by the appropriate DOD agency. The contractor will be required to prepare presentation aids and instructions to various service schools and agencies on use of technical handbooks and products. The contractor will be required to provide data collection, storage and retrieval services for information that is used in preparation of publications. The majority of this effort deals with revisions, changes, and updates of manuals and products for Surface-to-Surface (JMEM/SS), Air-to-Surface (JMEM/AS), Anti-Air (JMEM/AA), and Target Vulnerability. The major manuals of concern are as follows: 1. Methodology and Evaluation; 2. Reliability; 3. Delivery Accuracy; 4. Helicopter; 5. Small Computers; 6. Systems Characteristics; 7. Target Vulnerability; 8. Target Acquisition; 9. Missile Evaluation; and 10. Gun Evaluation. These manuals are constantly being reviewed, changed and/or revised. The work associated with this project shall be performed at both Eglin AFB, FL and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD using Government-provided facilities. The analytical function for the JMEM/SS will be accomplished at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD facility. The analytical functions for JMEM/AS, JMEM/AA, and Target Vulnerability will be accomplished at the Eglin AFB, FL facility. The publication and graphics support functions will be accomplished at the Eglin AFB, FL facility. Office furniture, office equipment, supplies, utilities, computer support, photographic support, printing support, and special equipment deemed necessary by the Government will be provided by the Government. Historically, there has been a 45-60 man year level of effort required to conduct this work. It is estimated that 60-65 trips (TDYs) away from Eglin AFB and Aberdeen Proving Ground will be required per year. A secret security clearance will be required for all personnel working on this contact. An Organizational Conflict of Interest provision will be included in any resultant contract. It is anticipated the period of performance will be 60 months total to include a basic 36 month period with one 24 month option. Firms interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualifications package, in accordance with Numbered Note 25, describing the company’s technical expertise and experience to accomplish the work described above. Responses submitted should be in one copy only and must be received within 15 days from the date of publication.

<DESC>The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/Product Support Provider in support of the Army Space Heater/ Improved Army Space Heater (ASH/IASH ) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Program. The Government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for the ASH/IASH.  The Government has not committed to PBL for the ASH/IASH at this time.  IAW Army Regulation 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs pre ferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployme nt support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint; and reduction in logistics costs.  The term PSI refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement. Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the ASH/IASH logistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General Support level maintenance th rough improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibility for all maintenance of the ASH/IASH.  Sustainment training would be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition , the contractor would be responsible for ASH/IASH configuration management, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 20 years.   Goal: The ultimate goal is improved readiness and ultra-reliability.  Our goal is to structure a contract, which would incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the process. Desired Results and Outcomes:  1.  Operational readiness 98% or better for the system.    2.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Potential Performance Measures: The following performance measures could be established for the ASH/IASH for supply support and can be tracked through the Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS).   1.   The PSI would be responsible for maintaining a Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) rate, e.g., less than 2% at the Organizational and Support (under the two-level maintenance concept; Field and Sustainment level of maintenance).  2.  The PSI would be responsible for the transportation/shipping of material to destination. The PSI would ship all assets to the commercial shipping address specified by the activity. The PSI would be responsible for meeting delivery time frames specified  below. The PSI must be able to provide asset visibility to the requisitioning agency and would be responsible for providing input to the Global Transportation Network (GTN) for all shipments of material for which the PSI is assigned as the Inventory Contr ol Point ICP.  Order Ship Time (OST) is the time from when a requisition is dropped to the time it is closed out by the recipient and is inclusive of transportation) Order Ship Time (OST) for Essentiality Code A items: 	Priority 01-03;   2-3 days  Priority 04-08;  4-5 days				 Priority 09-15	 6-8 days  Order Ship Time (OST) for Essentiality Code C items: 	Priority 01-03;   3-4 days 				Priority 04-08;  5-7 days 				Priority 09-15	 8-10 days 3.  Inventory Control. The PSI would be accoun table for the storage, management and distribution of the wholesale inventory using the PSIs approved inventory management processes. Warehouse Denials would be 0%.   The PSI would be responsible for the management and accountability of the retail stock a t ASL/ PLL level. The required outcome is to have serviceable spares and repair parts available to support planned ASH/IASH operational requirements. The PSI would report the status of the wholesale inventory to the Government 4. Quality of Parts. All articles delivered would be required to be free from defects in accordance with their operational application. Any article failing to operate correctly would be returned to the PSI for repair or replacement. If the PSI is a contrac tor, a monthly report would be required.  If the PSI is government, Quality Deficiency Reports (QDRs) would be monitored. 5. Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action. The PSI would, as part of an overall reliability program, define and describe the implementation of a failure and fault reporting, analysis and corrective action program. The PSI would tabulate and trac e all reported failures from discovery to action closeout. All failure analysis would be closed out within 60 days of occurrence unless the Government grants an extension. 6.  Supply Support Requirements. The PSI would procure, repair, overhaul, manage, and distribute spare parts and material, both repairable and consumable, to satisfy all ASH/IASH wholesale and retail supply support requirements. The PSI would procure and d istribute retail level requirements. This refers specifically to Authorized Stockage List (ASL) and Prescribed Load List (PLL).  The PSI would make recommendations to unit commanders on lines to be stocked at the unit and Direct Support (DS) level. The PSI  would be responsible for determining wholesale requirements to support demand forecasts. The PSI would provide the necessary services to accommodate anticipated Government requirements (deployments).  7. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The PSI would receive and process all requisitions and maintain an on- line requisition status tracking and reporting system capable of providing requisition and transportation status, requisition cancellations, and re quisition notifications. The system would have to be capable of providing status on all Government requisitions to authorized Government offices and individual requisition status to requisitioning units.  8. Configuration Management. The PSI would manage the ASH/IASH weapon system configuration to ensure integrity and compatibility of the system, subsystem, assembly, and subassembly configuration baseline in an automated configuration database.  9.  The PSI would administer and manage a repair program for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) while retaining other metrics as outlined above.  10.  Reduced Logistics Footprint  The government would seek a measurable reduction in number of tools required (special and common); measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair and troubleshooting tasks; measurable reduction of training required ; and a measurable increase in fuel economy. PBL System Candidates: See Appendix B for profile of the ASH/IASH. Systems to be supported under this PBL Program are systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and reset/recap systems.   These profiles would include both wartime and peacetime OPTEMPO and specific details necessary to determine level of work required to perform the support operations.

APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Product Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a private /public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI would be required to n egotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. Ultra-reliability:  The probability that an items performance will go beyond its intended function of a specified interval under stated conditions. APPENDIX B IASH/ASH PBL CANDIDATE PROFILE TEMPLATE System     Army Space Heater/Improved Army Space Heater (ASH/IASH) System Description/Mission Profile SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The ASH is a joint service military approved heater that supports Army and Air Force missions including Force Provide, DEPMEDS, maintenance operations, aviation maintenance operations as well as other critical operations centers. The IASH provides clean, h eated air to safely warm troops in cold and extreme cold weather envir onments. Special safety features include carbon monoxide sensors and alarms. Basic Sustainment Materiel (BSM):  There is a requirement that must be supplied before the unit can be operated.  It needs fuel. The ASH/IASH has a multi-fuel capability (JP-8 primary) with a 14 gallon internal fuel tank for operation at a minimum of 8 hou rs.  It operates on 3KW generator (external power).  Predecessor System Information:  Many crucial military activities and important facilities require the capability for sustained operations in cold weather conditions.  Shelters housing sensitive and/or critical operations in these locations must be heated with clean air to provide a tolerable environment for both personnel and equipment.  Present Army heaters do not provide the required air quality, are not rugged enough to meet military environmental requirements, are not adequate for use with all existing  shelters, do not support the concept of a one-fuel battlefield and present unnecessary health and safety risks to personnel.  Existing gas-fueled heaters are considered dangerous because of the gasoline fuel used and the unvented design which preclude saf e air re-circulation contributing to a carbon monoxide hazard.  The carbon monoxide hazard was cited in a 1 Apr 82 multi-service Ad Hoc Working Group meeting.  The IASH replaces existing gas-fueled heater cited by the Field Medical Systems Steering Group a s carbon monoxide hazard to troops in the field. Many of the heater components are over 20 years old making them more difficult to logistically support.  The ASH/IASH replaces the antiquated gasoline-fired heaters that are unsafe, dangerous, and obsolete a nd are not easily logistically supportable.   MISSION SCENARIO The IASH will operate worldwide to operate various shelters with clean, recycled air.  Storage, transportation, and deployment will include operations in cold, basic and hot climates as defined in AR 70-38. The IASH will be issued to units Army-wide and will be used throughout the Force XXI battle-space.  The IASH provides climatic conditioning for maneuver elements that require heat for aircraft engines and ground vehicles.  Command and control elements requ ire IASH climatic conditioning for tactical operation and communications centers.  Support elements such as base support companies (BSC), division support battalions (DSB), division aviation support battalions (DASB), and corps support commands (COSCOM) re quire IASH climatic conditioning for maintenance shelters, medical facilities, and troop billets.     RELIABILITY Thresholds and objectives are identified by [T] and [O], respectively.  Heaters will operate within an ambient temperature range from +65 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to -40 [T], -60 [O] degrees F unassisted start, -60 [T], -65 [O] degrees F assisted start, in a ll climatic conditions.  The heater capacities are 60,000 [T], 70,000 [O] BTUs; 120,000 [T], 150,000 [O] BTUs; and 350,000 [T], 400,000 [O] BTUs when operated at sea level up to 4,000 feet.  The heater will produce a rated output during inclined operations  of up to 10 degrees [T], 20 degrees [O] from the horizontal. The ASH/IASH must have a probability of completion of 20 consecutive days  operating 21.5 hours per day with no more than one essential function failure/system abort of a least R(EFF/SA) = 0.94.  The Median Time To Repair (MedTTR) for all Essential Unscheduled Maintenance Demands (EUMD) must not exceed 1 hour.  The Maximum Time T o Repair for 90% of all EUMD (MAXTTR 90) must not exceed 1.5 hours. OEM  CMDC-Choctaw Manufacturing Development Corporation McAlester, OK   Point of Contact Name:  Mr. Chet Hunter    Telephone Number:  (918) 426-2871		 Email Address:  chunter@cmdc.us Fleet Assessment   There is no AR 220-1 readiness reporting requirements for this heater. Maintenance Planning The heaters, singly or in multiples, must provide clean, heated output air (with clean ambient intake air) to existi ng shelters.  Under normal, 24-hour operating conditions (three 8-hour shifts); it will provide 21.5 hours of on-demand heat.  The additional 2.5 hours will consist of 1.5 hours for set up (to include starting, shut down and relocation) and 1 hour for prev entive maintenance checks and services (PMCS).  The heater will be used for varying time periods with refueling and scheduled services performed as required.  Routine servicing will be accomplished at the operator/crew level and will consist of, but not be  limited to, cleaning and replacing filter elements, refueling and conducting PMCS.  The PMCS will be performed by the authorized operator (unit-designated and licensed).  The DS and GS maintenance will be performed by MOS 63J, 52C, and 44B personnel.  Ope rator training will be provided by unit licensing authority.  Maintenance training will be conducted at the U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School (USAOCS) as it is for current space heaters.  The heater has the same mission when employed during peacetime as  it does during wartime.  The total maintenance ratio must not exceed 0.013 maintenance man-hours/operating hour.  Unit Maintenance Unit maintenance includes Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS), replacement of easily accessible unserviceable parts not requiring special tools or test materiel, lubrication, cleaning, preserving, tightening, replacement of parts and module s (authorized by the MAC, minor adjustments, and inspection of components.   Direct Support (DS) Maintenance. DS maintenance using common test equipment provides Line Replacement Unit (LRU) services to unit maintenance.   General Support (GS) Maintenance The current Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) does not identify any GS level tasks. Depot Maintenance No depot-level maintenance is required.  The only contract maintenance would be in conjunction with any applicable warranty. NOTE:  Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be sent via email to the POC below.

<SUBJECT>A -- Genetic Factors in Birth Defects
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NICHD-DESPR-PES-SS-2006-01
<RESPDATE>101905
<ARCHDATE>11022005
<CONTACT>Jason Williams, Contract Specilaist, Phone 301-402-6775, Fax 301-402-3676, Email willjas@mail.nih.gov - Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-6960, Fax 301-402-3676, Email cn43m@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with investigating genetic risk factors for birth defects.
 
The mapping of the human genome has made it possible to identify genes that are etiologically important in birth defects.  For example, the knowledge that folate was important in the etiology of neural tube defects (NTDs)(Medical Research Council, Czeizel) led to the identification of a variant in the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that increases the risk of having an NTD (Whitehead).  There is great potential for finding other gene related birth defects because recurrence risks indicate that there is a genetic component and because of the enormous genetic variability in the human population–any two individuals have approximately 3,000,000 differences in their genomes.
 
One of the limiting factors in this research area has been the availability of samples from a sufficient number of affected subjects (or families).  Because the etiology of many birth defects is multifactorial and because the penetrance of these genes is low (sometimes because of environmental factors), large numbers of cases must be studied to identify risks.  The possibility that defects are the result of gene-gene interactions also demands larger sample sizes to identify enough subjects with the combination of alleles in question.

Even a relatively common type of birth defect such as a neural tube defect occurs in only about 1 pregnancy in 1000.  Hundreds of cases of any birth defect are required to address even the simplest research questions.  Other birth defects of interest are much less common than neural tube defects.  Therefore, a large underlying population is needed to identify enough defects of interest.  Many important defects are too uncommon for even a large institution to accrue enough cases to conduct etiologic investigations.  There are few resources available to redress these problems.  

The objective of this research is: to acquire DNA from a large number of children who have major birth defects and from normal control children to investigate the role of genetic variants in birth defects.   The Government requires that these samples come from conceptuses delivered within a defined geographical area, and to include almost all birth defect cases born within that geographical area.  The Government also requires medical documentation sufficient to describe the birth defects, such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes or the equivalent.  Other relevant information such as additional data from medical records and information on risk factors (family history, exposure to teratogens) is highly desirable.
  


To be deemed capable a small business must demonstrate the following abilities:
1.	Possess information on all registered births occurring over a specified time frame (years) in a large, well-defined geographical area such as a state or province.
2.	Identify from among these births essentially all infants with major birth defects identified at birth as defined by a standard coding system such as the International Classification of Diseases. This requires staff members with documented expertise and experience in reviewing medical and vital records to classify birth defects.
3.	From the same population, identify a group of control subjects of sufficient size to provide at least one matched control for each birth defect case, and ensure that these control subjects do not have major birth defects identified at birth.
4.	Possess sufficient socio-demographic information on cases and controls to allow for matching on important risk factors such as race and maternal age.
5.	Have in their possession prior to the award of a contract, material containing DNA from the above mentioned cases and controls.  This DNA must be of sufficient quality and quantity to be usable for genotyping.  The quality and utility of the DNA must be demonstrated by prior successful extraction and genotyping. This may be documented by research using samples from this source.
6.	Demonstrate a record of experience and expertise in the collection and maintenance of the above mentioned records and DNA-containing samples.
7.	Demonstrate expertise in, and experience with, producing, maintaining, and ensuring the quality of large data files.
8.	Demonstrate competence in storage, retrieval, and transport of information and biological specimens.
9.	Have the legal authority to obtain information from vital records (birth certificates, death certificates, etc.) and medical sources to collect data on birth defects and other outcomes of interest.

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees.  SUBMITTED CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST ALSO ADDRESS HOW THE BUSINESS MEETS THE APPLICABLE SIZE STANDARD.  Please include your DUNS number with your Capability Statement.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to the attention of Jason Williams at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Wednesday, October 19, 2005.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

We are seeking information relating to industry interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the roles of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/Product Support Provider in support of the LC FH PBL Program. The Government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for the LCFH.  The Government has not committed to PBL for the LCFH at this time.  IAW Army Regulation 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support;  reduction in the logistics footprint; and reduction in logistics costs.  The term PSI refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement.  Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the LCFH lo gistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General Support level maintenance through improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibility for all maintenance of t he LCFH.  Sustainment training would be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the contractor would be responsible for LCFH configuration management, to include recommendation a nd implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability.

<ARCHDATE>12182005
<CONTACT>Richard Sturgis, 703-325-6068
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  The US Army Contracting Agency-ITEC4 is planning an acquisition for the requirements of the Program Management Support Services-Two (PMSS-2) program.  PMSS-2 is a follow-on to the current PMSS Blanket Purchase  Agreements (BPAs) with BearingPoint and L3/Titan which expire 3 September 2008.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify qualified sources that can meet the Armys support services requirements, and to solicit comments on the Statement of Objectives ( SOO) and the proposed acquisition strategy. The PMSS-2 program is managed by the Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Operations and Mission Support Directorate (OMSD), Contracts Management Office (CMO), Ft Belvoir, VA  22060.  The PMSS-2 program will provide program m anagement support services to the 40+ program managers, project managers, and organizational elements across the PEO EIS spectrum.  For more information about the PEO EIS organization, see the following website:  https://my.eis.army.mil/pws/index1.htm Objective.  The PMSS-2 contractor(s) will be required to provide a broad range of non-personal, technical and management services in order to meet the Government's individual task order objectives.  Interested sources should refer to the draft SOO for addi tional information about the Government's objectives and requirements.  The draft SOO may be obtained by submitting an email request to the following addresses:  mailto:william.horton@itec4.army.mil or mailto:jeri.justice@itec4.army.mil. Comments on Draft SOO.  Prospective Offerors are invited to submit comments on the draft SOO.  Comments on the draft SOO shall not exceed 5 pages. Acquisition Strategy.  At least five, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts will be awarded.  Ordering scope will be limited to PEO EIS components.  The geographic scope of the contract will include CONUS and OCONUS, and onsite work may  be required in hazardous locations, such as Iraq.  The contracts and task orders will be performance-based.  Task orders will be competed from time to time on a fair opportunity basis among all PMSS-2 contractors.  The contract life will be 7 to 10 years.   The total estimated value of all orders issued under the PMSS-2 contracts is $500M to $1B (10,000,000 to 20,000,000 manhours).  The applicable NAICS code is 541611.  The applicable FSC is R408.     Pricing Strategy.  The PMSS-2 contracts will utilize both Time and Materials (T&M) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders, but Task Orders will be predominantly T&M.  Requirement Strategy.  The Government plans on requesting each Offeror to submit a Performance Work Statement (PWS) based on the Statement of Objectives (SOO) in the solicitation.  More detailed requirements will be provided for the Task Order competitions .  Transition of existing PMSS BPA Task Orders to the PMSS-2 contracts will begin before the PMSS BPA expires on 3 September 2008.        Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs).  Interested sources are advised that the provisions of FAR Subpart 9.5 concerning OCIs will govern Task Orders issued under the PMSS-2 contract and that potential OCIs with current and future procurements and pr ograms may exist, in accordance with FAR 9.505-1 through 9.505-4, because of the tasks in the SOO, such as requirements management, specification development, program oversight, independent testing, etc.  Consequently, the PMSS-2 contractors will be exclud ed from participating in these procurements and programs.  Conversely, it is anticipated that at a minimum all current ITES1 prime contractors will be excluded from participating in the PMSS-2 competition.      Due Diligence.  A draft solicitation, pre-solicitation conference, and pre-proposal conference are not considered necessary and are not planned.  However, due diligence meetings are anticipated after release of the solicitation.  Evaluation Approach.  A best value  evaluation will be performed IAW FAR Part 15.  The Government will select the proposals that are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  The evaluation factors under consideration include Price, Past Performance, Personnel Qualification s, and the Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation.  The Government is considering evaluating Technical Approach as part of the individual task order competitions, and not as part of the PMSS-2 competition.              Schedule.  The Government plans on releasing the PMSS-2 solicitation in the first quarter of FY 06.  At the appropriate time an additional solicitation synopsis will be issued and the solicitation will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site.  Comments on Acquisition Strategy.

This notice constitutes the formal announcement and commencement of the A-76 cost comparison study for the Education and Training A-76 Streamlined with MEO Competitive Sourcing Study on 9/28/2005, under the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003.  This study is expected to be completed on or earlier than December 28, 2005 at which time a formal decision shall be rendered.  However, the Competitive Sourcing Official has granted an extension of 45 additional days if deemed necessary for completion. These services are located at the Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in Arlington Heights, IL., and are performed by thirty-seven (37 FTE) personnel.  FTE involved in the OSHA Training Institute study provide, develop or support instruction and technical expertise in Construction, Occupational Safety, Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene in accordance with the OSH Act of 1970 and testify as expert witnesses in court or before administrative boards.  The start date is 9/28/2005, until concluded under the Streamlined Competition Process that will include an MEO. The purpose of this Streamlined w/MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is more economical for the private sector or the Government to continue to perform the operation, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for OSHA Education and Training Support Services is a Streamlined w/MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76. This synopsis serves to publish not only the official start date in FEDBIZOPPS at www.eps.gov. (after October 01, 2005 be sure use only www.fbo.gov or www.fedbizopps.gov), but to provide essential information about the study and the potential opportunity to contract for the requirement.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Dennis Sprouse, and the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham.  The cost comparison process is as follows:  in accordance with the A-76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market pricing information against the Government’s MEO estimate to perform the function and make a final decision.  If it appears that market analyses are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the private/commercial pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract.  A formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If a formal procurement becomes necessary, the procurement may be set-aside in one of the various set-aside categories (SB, 8(a), etc.). If the government MEO estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

<SUBJECT>75 -- FSC 7510 - FPI Plastic File Folders
<DESC>Under the provisions of FPI's guidelines process, published March 12, 1997, in the Federal Register and March 25, 1997, in the Commerce Business Daily, FPI submits the following "good faith" announcement for public notice and comment.  In response to an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), FPI proposes to manufacture plastic file folders for sale competitively to DHS, without mandatory source.

Under FPI's guidelines covering the production of new products and significant expansion of existing products, the primary determinant of what constitutes a "specific product" is an item's Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code.  Plastic file folders fall within Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code 7510 - Office Supplies.  FPI has recorded sales in this category every year since FY 1989.  The most appropriate SIC codes for plastic file folders is SIC 3089 - Plastic Products, Not Elsewhere Classified. 

FPI has a history of making similar items in the FSC code for plastic file folders.  Previously,  FPI has produced items in the relevant SIC code as well.  For this reason, FPI believes plastic file folders do not meet the definition of "new product" set forth by FPI's guidelines.  However, FPI recognizes that a reasonable person may construe this item to be a product separate and distinct from any other made by FPI. 

Under the terms of FPI's expansion guidelines, interested parties may submit comments regarding this proposed production by FPI.  In submitting comments to FPI, the following guidelines will apply:

1) Comments will be due within 21 days of the date of this notice;

2) Relevant comments will focus on and address why plastic file folders should be considered a new product, separate and distinct from a similar item currently produced by FPI;

3) While the primary purpose of the comments will be to determine if the item should be defined as a new product, comments related to market share and/or the impact resulting from such a production decision may also be considered relevant.

All comments received in response to this announcement will be considered by FPI.  All commenters will be advised when FPI makes a final determination.  Any interested party has a right to raise any question at any time with FPI's Board of Directors. 

All comments should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Planning, Research, and Activation Branch, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Solicitation of interest involving Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag and system testing.
<DESC>EPA is seeking interested RFID vendors to participate in a program to test a unique use of RFID tags and systems useful in shipping certain chemicals/materials from generator to receiver.  The shipping scenario would include checkpoints along the way, including across North American borders.  The project offers multiple challenges, including: tag data should be capable of capture in an information management system.  Read range should be 5-10 feet, with 100% read capability through metal, lequid, solids, and viscous materials; tags should be resistant to environmental factors, including heat, humidity, impact, vibration, acids, dirt, and radiation; individual item tagging in a pallet packing configuration, with 100% read rate; the use of multiple storage facilities and trucking firms; tracking at choke points along the travel route.  System security is vital.  Selected vendors would have the freedome to design the tagging configuraiton and the type of tags used, and we are looking for innovative solutions for this difficult shipping scenario.  This program is being carried out under EPA's Environmental and Sustainable Technology Evaluation (ESTE)/Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program, and is a partial cost-sharing program.  The project is targeted to high-risk Agency needs, and will have high visibility.  Results of the testing will be verified by the USEPA and will be published.  EPA will initiate and directly manage verifications of up to 10 potential vendors.  Questions may be submitted to bearden.janet@epa.gov no later than October 11, 2005.  Questions and accompanying answers will be provided to all who have responded.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT ON DRAFT TWO-PHASE DESIGN BUILD REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM (BCT) FACILITIES INSTRUCTIONS TO REVIEWERS: In support of the Armys Transformation and Realignment Programs, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is inviting questions, comments, and recommendations from the DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (NAICS CODES STARTING WITH 236, 237, 238, 541) on a DR AFT Two-Phase Design Build Request for Proposals (RFP) to be used for the first generation of Brigade Combat Team (BCT) facilities, beginning with selected Fiscal Year 2006 Military Construction Program projects.  This DRAFT RFP is posted to FEDBIZOPS unde r W912QU05R9999 entitled DRAFT DESIGN BUILD RFP FOR COMMENT BY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY or can be downloaded from the Government Agency URL noted below.   Questions, comments, and recommendations are to be emailed to Mr. Michael Duffy (256-895-1793) on or before 4:00 P.M. Central Time on October 14, 2005 at the following email address: Michael.R.Duffy@usace.army.mil  Reviewers shall provide the Reviewers Name, Firm Name, and Contact Information with active email address.   All questions, comments, and recommendations are to be provided in MS Word Format ONLY using the attached form and pre-set format for responding to this request for ease of review by the USACE team.     All responses will be consolidated by the USACE team.  All questions, comments and recommendations will be addressed by email to all responders (please ensure that the email address provided is correct).     After all questions, comments, and recommendations have been addressed, a REVISED DRAFT RFP may be posted for an additional review and comment period, should time allow.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The objectives of the Armys Transformation and Realignment Programs are to design and construct new Brigade Combat Team (BCT) facilities for the U. S. Army that are consistent with the design and construction practices used for civilian sector projects th at perform similar functions to the military projects.  For example, a Dining Facility has a similar function as College or Corporate Cafeteria in the civilian sector  provide a variety of freshly prepared cold and hot nutritious meals three times a day u sing serving lines and islands (additional inherently governmental field feeding requirements will also need to be addressed); hence the design and construction of the facility should be consistent with the design and construction of College or Corporate C afeteria with the additional capacity to handle field feeding needs.  A further comparison of Military Facilities to Civilian Facilities is listed here: Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH)  Apartment/College Dormitory, Battalion/Brigade Headqu arters (BH)  Corporate Office, Company Operations Facilities (COF)  Office/Warehouse, Dining Facility (DF)  College/Corporate Cafeteria, Tactical Equipment Maintenance Facility (TEMF)  Heavy Equipment/Vehicle Maintenance Garage. It is the U.S. Armys objective that the facilities are required to have a minimum 25-year useful life before needing any major renovation, repair, or replacement (i.e., communications wiring or materials like roofing, flooring, and lighting - not referrin g to entire building replacement).  Therefore, the design and construction should provide an appropriate level of quality to ensure the continued use of the facility over that time period with the application of reasonable preventive maintenance and repair s that would be industry-acceptable to a major civilian sector project owner.  The design and construction should also allow for flexibility in the facility to handle the changing needs/size of the Army over time.  The site infrastructure is required to ha ve a minimum 50-year life expectancy with industry-accepted maintenance and repair cycles. The government is required by Public Law 102-486, Executiv e Order 12902, and Federal Regulations 10 CFR 435 to design and construct facilities in an energy-conserving manner while considering life cycle cost over the life of the facilities. The project site(s) should be developed for efficiency and to convey a sense of unity or connectivity with the adjacent buildings and with the Installation as a whole. This DRAFT RFP is meant to be Performance Based in nature and the requirements stated in this DRAFT RFP are minimums.  Industry is encouraged to comment on how USACE can ensure that it receives innovative, creative, and lower life-cycle cost effective solu tions, which meet or exceed the DRAFT RFP requirements.  This should also include the level of prescriptive detail that may conflict with a Performance Based Acquisition. Additionally, the industry is encouraged to comment on how USACE can expedite the design and construction schedule based on the requirements in this DRAFT RFP.   DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAFT RFP: The Army and USACE currently anticipates that the initial contracts awarded for the BCT facilities will be procured using Design Build contracts to meet its facility requirements.  The contracts will be awarded using a Trade-Off Process to determine the ov erall Best-Value contractor for that project.  The contracts may be single award or multiple award contracts for use at one or multiple installations.  The contracts also may be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contracts where task orde rs would be written for specific projects under the base contract.  It is expected that the work may be performed either locally, (at one specific installation) or regionally (within a yet to be defined area for work at multiple installations in the define d area) depending on the facility type.  This DRAFT RFP is not meant to be specific to any project or location.  This DRAFT RFP has been developed in order to attempt to provide a consistent procurement vehicle and process to evaluate and award Design Build contracts across all U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers district offices.  It does not reflect any particular acquisition strategy selected by the executing districts.  The DRAFT RFP is for a hypothetical Single Award Design Build contract for an entire Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Project using a 2-Pha se procurement method.   This DRAFT RFP when finalized will likely be used on actual projects that involve less than a full BCT requirement by selecting the appropriate facility types, then editing out the non-applicable Scope of Work in Section 01010 and in Sections 00110 and 001 20 - Proposal Submission Requirements, and Proposal Evaluation and Basis for Award.   The DRAFT RFP assumes that the BCT will be a green grass project, to be built in an undeveloped area within the installations fence line.  The DRAFT RFP does not address demolition requirements for in-fill of BCT facilities or renovations to existing faci lities.  The executing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers district will add such requirements when applicable to a project, in addition to any other site specific requirements.

FBO Destination CONUS The Systems Integration Office, Bureau of Information Resource Management  (IRM/OPS/SIO), of the Department of State requires hardware to support the  ongoing development efforts associated with the Enterprise Server Operations  Center project.

The Motion LS800  Centrino (Manufacturer's Number MCX-101.011.01) identified for this  acquisition is known to satisfy these requirements and will reduce the risk  of failure due to faulty equipment.  The purchase order awarded as the  result of this procurement will provide the staff of SIO the necessary  desktop configurations to support ongoing ESOC development activities.  To  allow for standard installation/troubleshooting procedures and to permit  standard &quot;ghosting&quot; activities, the items being procured must be the same as  those already installed in the Division.

The solicitation number is 1069-5Z7152 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-27.

FOB Destination shall be Springfield, VA 22153 <BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, EXACT MATCH ONLY, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Gentex TBH (Tactical Ballistic Helmet) - GT-2000 NIJ 0106.01 Level 3A The TBH offers the following advantages when compared to the current MICH Ballistic Helmet.  The TBH also meets or exceeds the US Military Standard (17 grain FSP) V50 2150 FPS., 150, EA;<BR>LI 002, M16/AR15 Front Sling Thing For Dovetails The new GG&G Sling Thing For Dovetails provides the flexibility to mount the front sling attachment anywhere on the tactical foregrip rails that meet the mission requirement. As with all of our &quot;Sling Things&quot;, this latest addition to the product line provides a lightweight, durable, easy-to-install and inexpensive method for front sling attachment. Manufactured from tough 7075 billet aluminum, black hard-coat anodized, meets MIL-STD-1913, 100% American Made. GGG-1203 BattleLab CG Sling The CG Sling is simple but effective. It has a quick release, single point attachment and is designed to be used with single point attachment plate.  Model # BLPF-36, 50, EA;<BR>LI 003, BattleLab CQB Duty Belts This ultra rigid duty belt will serve as a solid platform for your drop leg rigs and primary LBE kit.  Model # BLPF01, 50, EA;<BR>LI 004, F.O.G. ? Fast-Rope/Operator Glove? Designed to get you down the rope and straight to guns, the F.O.G. provides exactly the protection you need while allowing you to maintain dexterity. Transitioning will never be a problem from this point on! The F.O.G. features a Nomex/Kevlar? construction and provides four times the cut-resistance of leather, as well as heat and flash protection to 800?F (427?C). The entire glove is sewn with non-melting nylon thread. Water resistant kangaroo leather palms provide superior abrasion and cut resistance. Cut-ring stitching allows optional removal of the index finger for trigger control, without unraveling the remaining edge. The ergonomic fit, tactile sensation and features found in the F.O.G. are the same found in the SOG glove and are unmatched. An elasticized wrist keeps the F.O.G. taut, while the elasticized wrist strap keeps out foreign objects (sand, dirt, etc.), prevents snagging and adds support to the user?s wrist. A second layer of leather in the palm provides additional protection and is ergonomically cut to prevent bunching while clenching objects. Foam padding in the heel of the palm cushions the shock of firearm recoil. Posi-Grip? non-skid material in the cradle of the hand provides a confident grip when using weapons or tools. The key feature of the F.O.G. is the replacement gloves for fast-roping. Each pair of F.O.G.?s can be fitted with a set of replacement fast-rope over-gloves. This over-glove technology allows the operator to simply replace the leather instead of replacing the entire glove as the leather wears down. Each over-glove features an elastic back and adjustable backhand strap for a more comfortable fit.  Model # SOG-F15, 50, EA;<BR>LI 005, PVS-14 NVG Mount The PVS-14 NVG Mount is an adapter/mounting system that allows mounting of the AN/PVS-14, AN/PVS-7, MUM-14, TAG-7 or TAM-14 to the PASGT &quot;Kevlar&quot; helmet. This mount features fine vertical (Pitch) and eye releve adjustment and allows the NVG to be quickly and securly swung up and out of the users line of sight when the NVG is not in use. The quick release allows the adapter and or NVG to be stowed without removal of the mount.  Model #A3256368., 50, EA;<BR>LI 006, R.B.V.-&quot;Predator? Ballistic Vest Adjustability ? The Shoulders are adjustable with hook and loop and the cummerbund is adjustable in 1&quot; increments to give fit and form to the operator. This allows for easy adjustment when going into different environments or carrying different loads on the vest platform. An optional concealable carrier is available to match the ballistic package in the vest. This allows the wearer to have a dual purpose ballistic vest and cuts down on the weight that the operator carries in his kit.  Model #RBS/DS, 50, EA;<BR>LI 007, R.B.V. Victory The Victory is a basic version of the Predator. With no load bearing platform, the Victory Armor vest is very conducive to separate load bearing vest over the top. Utilizing both interior and exterior cummerbunds, the vest is well fitting and allows maximum mobility. With adjustable shoulder straps and side cummerbunds, the Victory has proven to be a highly comfortable armor vest. Rounding out the Victory design, like other Predator-based models, is the integrated drag handle that has been tested to over 350 lbs. without tearing out.  Model #: RBV-V, 100, EA;<BR>LI 008, R.C.V. ? Concealable Vest The Diamondback Tactical R.C.V. was designed with the operator and officer in mind. This 6 point adjustable vest has the same level 3A ballistic package as the R.C.B.V. and R.B.V. Predator vests. We wanted to offer our customers two vests in one. The ballistic panels that are in our tactical packages are interchangeable with the concealable carrier. What this means is a cost savings to the end user and less gear to haul around. When designing this concealable vest, we wanted to serve two distinct purposes. The first was to offer our customers an extremely lightweight, low cost level 3A ballistic vest and the second, to work interchangeably with our tactical vests, again saving money for our customers. Made of a washable 65/35 poly-cotton blend, the R.C.V. will hold up very well under adverse conditions. The R.C.V. can utilize any one of three type III-A offerings. All our ultra high performance ballistic packages are certified to N.I.J. Standard 0101.04.  Model # GPA-3A-1, 150, EA;<BR>LI 009, DBT Ultra Concealable Level 3+ Stand Alone Ballistic Rifle Plate This highly concealable plate was designed to defeat today?s current threat while giving the operator the ability to wear a concealable lightweight ballistic plate. As you can see in the image, this multi-hit plate defeated 2 hits of M855 Green Tip at 3000 ft. per second, and 2 hits of M193 5.56 Ball at 3300 ft. per second. You can?t go wrong with this plate for both tactical or concealable use. Threat Level: III + 5.56 x 45 ? M193 Ball 5.56 x 45 ? M855 NATO Green Tip 5.45 x 39 ? Soviet Ball AK-74 7.62 x 39 ?

STATEMENT OF WORK
For Independent Industry Subject Matter Expert
Consultant Joint Manufacturing Surveillance Team 
	
Introduction:

The V-22 program is a joint venture between Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.(BHTI), Fort Worth, Texas and Boeing Helicopter, Philadelphia.  The Buying Activity is NAVAIR, located at Patuxent River, Maryland.  The customers are the Marine Corps for the MV-22 and the Air Force Special Operations Command for the CV-22 variant.  The program has been transitioning from Low Rate Initial Production to a Full Rate Production transition in FY08. Current production for this FY is 19 aircraft. 

The H-1 program is a Bell Helicopter only program. The Buying Activity is NAVAIR located at Patuxent River, Maryland. This program is in its LRIP Lots 1 and 2 production phase for a total of 16 aircraft. 


Background:

Over the last 12 months, Bell Helicopter manufacturing processes for the V-22 program have improved to the extent that a positive Milestone III discussion is anticipated from the Defense Acquisition Board by fiscal year end 2005. The marked improvement in Bell Helicopter¡¦s performance can, in part, be attributed to the due diligence of the Joint Manufacturing Surveillance Team (JMST) and the Manufacturing Senior Executive Review Board (M-SERB).  This process of continued independent assessment of contractor¡¦s business practices has yielded improvements in the quality, production planning, and scheduling elements of the enterprise.  The changes are only in the initial phases and have reduced the number of part shortages from an average of over 400 to a current average of 77 during a period of 12 months for the V-22 program. In order for a cultural change to be fully demonstrated at Bell Helicopter, this performance will have to be demonstrated on other military programs assuring business practices are consistent. The JMST and the M-SERB are chartered to ensure the transformation. 

DCMA has influenced positive outcomes by supplying a consultant Subject Matter Expert (SME) to participate in activities on the Manufacturing Senior Executive Review Board. The SME has sustained a non-advocacy role in assessing management gaps within the Bell Helicopter Government Business Unit. The SME has consulted with the DCMA-led JMST to assist in articulating enterprise constraints, which would inhibit full rate production on V-22 and H-1 Upgrade Programs. Currently, both programs are in the acquisition phase of  Pre-Milestone III (V-22 DAB review scheduled for late September 2005 and H-1 review for Summer of 2006) full rate production. It is anticipated that the Defense Acquisition Board will use the M-SERB process to report progress on any stipulations included in upcoming Acquisition Decision Memorandums. The NAVAIR PEO(A) has expressed interest in maintaining the M-SERB process until a successful H-1 Milestone III decision. The role of the DCMA independent SME was increased during an M-SERB meeting held on September 22, 2005 where the SME was tasked to work with the JMST and Senior Vice Presidents from Bell Helicopter and Boeing to restructure the charter of the JMST.   The new charter will more aggressively influence positive outcomes that result in sustained program performance on V-22 and H-1 production. An extension to the existing consulting agreement is requested to include the modified detailed tasking.
 
Details of the tasking:

The consultant will support the Manufacturing Senior Executive Review Board (M-SERB) as an advisor to the JMST and as a representative of DCMA Bell Helicopter Joint Manufacturing Surveillance Team (JMST).  

As consultant to the M-SERB/JMST the SME will be required to:

(1)	Assist the JMST in developing Engineering Manufacturing Readiness Levels (EMRLs) for measuring progressive enterprise transformation in the areas of:
a.	V-22 and H-1 Affordability
b.	Bell Helicopter Pre-Emptive Quality
c.	Bell Helicopter and Boeing Supplier Management
d.	Bell Helicopter Enterprise Systems Modernization
(2)	Develop tactical short term objectives for the JMST to influence outcomes on top driving program constraints for both V-22 and H-1. 
(3)	Develop tactical and transformational exit criteria for both contractor and program M-SERB end-state.
(4)	Develop a quarterly reporting template for reporting of any V-22 and H-1 Acquisition   Decision Memorandum (ADM) guidance issued per program. 
(5)	Direct the Joint Manufacturing Surveillance Team and represent the JMST in meetings with the Office of Secretary Defense Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) and Department of the Navy.
(6)	Refine and review the JMST¡¦s ongoing and future surveillance plans and operating charter. 
(7)	Support PEO (A) in various meetings with Department of Defense management agencies. 
(8)	Assist the JMST in evaluating the adequacy of Bell Helicopter¡¦s execution to NAVAIR Production Readiness Review findings and recommendations for V-22.
(9)	Participate in meetings as required.

Deliverables:

Monthly independent report of assessments and recommendations.
Final report of assessments and recommendations.  
Monthly billing statements.

Details of the deliverable content:

All deliverables to be send to Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR)
(COTR-DCMA Bell Helicopter Textron). Point of contact is Mr. Rodney D. Mayo, P.E., DCMA Bell Helicopter, AKOA, P.O. Box 1605, Fort Worth, TX 76101-1605.

Final Report ¡V An independent assessment of BHTI¡¦s readiness and ability to meet production requirements for both V-22 and H-1 Naval Air Systems Command Contracts. 

Billing statements will include daily billable time logged, material and travel/per-diem costs.

Period of Performance Specific Dates (Contract Extension) :

Contract performance period will be from September 30, 2005 thru September 29, 2006.  The total period of performance would be 12 months.

Performance Outcomes:

ƒÞ	Sustained On-Time Delivery Performance of V-22 and H-1 Aircraft to the warfighter. 
ƒÞ	DCMA collective ability to influence outcomes in the best interest of NAVAIR PEO(A) and NAVAIR V-22 and H-1 Program Offices.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V21412SEP2005CVN70; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) the following items;
0001 – Provide and Install Porcelain Tile Deck Covering:  No QPL or Mil-Spec currently exists for these materials.  All products must meet the requirements of commercial standard A137.1.  A copy of this standard can be obtained from: Tile Council of America, Inc., 100 Clemson Research Blvd., Anderson, SC 29625. phone: 864-646-8453, fax:864-646-2821. url: http:/www.tileusa.com.    Contractor shall remove existing deck covering down to bare metal surface.  Prepare and prime deck surface in accordance with GENSPEC Section 631.  Install approved underlayment to level surface and cover any raised areas across the surface area.  Install new porcelain tiles throughout entire areas specified iaw best commercial standards for this type of product and the fact that it is being installed on board a U.S. Navy ship.  The following method is a suggestion only:   
Install underlayment type 1 class 2 mil 3135 epoxy to 100% level (plus or minus 2%) by screed or laser or hand.  Rubber leveler coat is authorized once underlayment base is established.  Contractor shall understand how critical this deck leveling stage is to the overall success of the installation.  Install porcelain tile using NAVSEA approved epoxy setting material i.e. Ansia118.3 using a 3/8 notched trowel and back butter the tile 100% for a nice level setting bed.  Contractor shall grout using NAVSEA approved epoxy grout i.e. Mapie Kera epoxy.  Ship's representative shall choose tile style, size, color selection and final design
1.	Remove Existing Decking.  Install Porcelain Tile.  

SPACE	NAME	SQUARE FT	EXISTING DECK
WARDROOM 3	WARDROOM 3	2200	STRATICA
WARDROOM 1 & 2	WARDROOM 1 & 2	3000	STRATICA
FWRD MESS DECKS	FWRD MESS DECKS	6100	QUARY TILE

Contractor shall maintain completion log in order to track contract ‘ceiling’ of specified square footage.  The area of decking measures approximately 11,300 SF as follows: (clean RFQ and Scope of Work spreadsheet copy is available upon request via email at scott.wilkins@navy.mil).
1. The area of decking measures approximately 11,300 SF.
2. The 11,300 SF does NOT include ‘underlayment’ + ‘porcelain tile’.  This approach would only produce a total porcelain tile coverage of 5650 SF.  The total SF after installation shall include both underlayment and porcelain tile so that final project completion shall result in 11,300 SF of porcelain tile installed.
3. The list of spaces spreadsheet shall be considered an estimate only. Actual space identification shall be established and agreed upon at a pre-work planning conference(s) between contractor and ship’s designated representative(s).
4. Offerors shall quote a firm fixed price for labor, materials, and installation for removal and installation of 11,300 SF. The log tracking system established by the contractor and certified by the ship’s designated representative (identified at pre-work planning conference) shall serve to verify the scope of work, in this case NTE 11,300 SF
Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 31 MAR 2006.  FOB Point Destination Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard for 100% of the work effort.  Contractor shall adhere to all requirements and regulations of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the USS Carl Vinson CVN-70 and the Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipyard. 
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>28 Sep 05 Update:  The following questions were received in regard to synopsitation FA8601-05-T-0273 1.  Will Wright-Patterson AFB provide laptops or desktops and internet access? Yes we will be able to provide configurable desktops and internet access in a  classroom environment. 2.  Why doesn+t Wright-Patterson AFB want a CEH-certified curriculum? CEH-certified courses tend to focus on teaching the student how to use a  handful of tools that are available on the internet.  While this knowledge is  somewhat useful during a penetration test, our goal is to expand on this and  learn how to turn our results into a professional report.  Most of our students  know how to use these tools, but need to learn the methodology behind a full  penetration test.  This methodology could include identifing protection  opportunities, justifing testing activities and optimizing security controls to  reduce business risk. ****************************************************************************** SYNOPSITATION FOR ON-SITE PEN TESTING TRAINING FA8601-05-T-0273  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for on-site pen testing training  classes at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, prepared in accordance with (IAW)  the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information  included in this notice.

<DESC>Opportunity Extended to 30 SEPT 2005. 12:00 Pacific Hawaii Time. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice . This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. SITUATION: Currently, an existing HF system provides limited communications connectivity between the JFHQ-HI Joint Operation s Center (JOC) and facilities on four neighbor islands. However, the system is voice only, lacks standardization, difficult to opera te effectively, many components are dates and it offer no mobility to extend communications to the incident scene or comman d center. DETERMINATION: In the event of a widespread communication failure, the HF network is the only system that can provide communication connectivity between the islands when all other means of communication is lost or destroyed. Natural disasters suc h as hurri canes or tropical storms can typically disable landline and cellular systems for days. Terrorist incidents can immobilize communications systems due to overload or possible direct attack on communications nodes. In any case, an independent and r eliable com munications system is needed to support C41 requirements during incident response. The State of Hawaii consists of seven applicable islands that cover an ocean area that s approximately 300 miles long and 100 miles wide. Hawaii Army National Gu ard has unit s positioned on five of these islands, and each of these units is tasked with an emergency response function for local disasters. Primary communications for data and voice is via  hard wire  systems. If communications is lost between the islan ds, then Ha waii Army National Guard units would be severely limited in their ability to respond to local incidents. An updated and standardized HF network can provide reliable data and voice connectivity between our units on each island and significantly enhance the Hawaii Army National Guard s effectiveness during incident response. SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS: The HF Radio system is being enhanced to support the Hawaii Army National Guard with the ability to long haul voice/data communications. The system sho uld include, but is not limited to the follow: Text messaging - The radio softwar e should support this application. 1. PC interface   Allows the radio to be controlled via the PC. 2. E-mail capability   The radio can send emails out and is compatible with  LANs and WANs. 3. Must be compatible with other HF ALE radios in use. 4. The system will include the proper power supplies, antennas, mounting kits and accessories. 5. It must be capable of operating independent of the local communications infrastructure;  it must be man-portable and function in all-weather conditions. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT: Each key facility will receive one HF ALE radio transceiver, one data modem/vocoder for digital voice/data, one radio programmer terminal, and appropriate power supplies/ antenna equipment. This distribution will provide a voice and dat a connection between the JFHQ JOC, subordinate major commands, and each neighbor island unit. The HF communications package for a deployable JTF will consist of one HF ALE rapid deployment p ackage (RDP) and two HF ALE back-pack radio systems. The deployab le JTF package will provide immediate voice and data capabilities from the JFHQ JOC from the JFHQ JOC to a JTF that s deployed anywhere within the state, significantly enhancing C41 capabili ties to forward forces and improving unit response in the field. SUPPORT EQUIPMENT: These radio systems are commercially-off-the-shelf systems (COTS) with a 4-year manufacturer s warranty. Radio maintenance beyond operator level will be accomplished by ret urning the broken unit to the vendor for repair and/or replacemen t. New equipment training is provided by the manufacturer for the radio system purchased. Sust ainment training will be accomplished throu gh train-the-trainer concept. FOB Point Destination: Delivery and acceptance for all items will be in Honolulu, Hawaii 96816. DELIVERY- Provide consolidated shipment at one time specify that. Otherwise provide es timated delivery within the CLIN. NOTES: Provide primary General Schedule for order. Identify other General Schedules in CLIN or identify Open Market per that CLIN as applicable. FREIGHT: Provide if cost is separate of CLIN items.

<DESC>1.1 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY. The evaluation of qualifying proposals will consist of three parts, 1.1.1 	The SSEB will evaluate an offeror's Present/Past Performance at a factor level that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk considering all potential evaluation criteria identified in this section.  1.1.2 The SSEB will evaluate an offeror's technical proposal using a color rating that combines technical merit and proposal risk that most accurately defines the offeror's performance risk.  1.1.3 	The SSEB will evaluate price and assign a go or no/go rating to each proposal.  1.2 	The following process will be used to determine the best value for selection of the medical training equipment award. 1.2.1 To arrive at a Best Value decision, the Source Selection Authority will integrate the evaluation Price with Past/Present Performance and Technical. Past Performance and technical are rated higher than the price factor with technical significantly mor e important than past performance. The firms that represent the best value to the Government will be selected for award. 1.2.2 The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the contracts without discussions, therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  1.2.3 If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in th e competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. 1.2.4 The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award contracts to offerors submitting a proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. 1.2.5 The Contracting Specialist will conduct a proposal compliance review before the convening of the Source Selection Board and refer any non-compliant proposals to the Contracting Officer and/or SSA for determination of adequacy.  Failure to comply with  solicitation instructions (outlined in the solicitation) will result in the proposal being found non-responsive, rejected and eliminated from further consideration for award. 1.2.6 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 2.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA 2.1 PAST/PRESENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION  	2.1.1  The SSEB will conduct a performance risk assessment based upon the past performance of the offeror as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the work required by the solicitation. The evaluation will consider the offeror's pa st/present performance considering currency, relevancy, sources, context, and trends to include but not limited to: 2.1.1.1	Offerors business practices  2.1.1.2	Customer relationship 2.1.1.3	Ability to provide the requested product 2.1.1.4	Prior experience 2.1.1.5	Adherence to schedule 2.1.1.6	Quality of contractors team 			2.1.2  In conducting the performance risk assessment, the SSEB may use data provided by the offeror, and data obtained from other sources.   The contracting firm should provide the Government with the most current past performance references. A referenc e name, contract number, phone number, fax number and/or e-mail address should be submitted to allow the Gov ernment to obtain adequate past performance information.  The evaluator may: evaluate present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires completed by the offeror's references; use data independently obtained from other Government or  commercial sources, to include but not limited to Government databases; or reliance upon personal business experience with the offeror.  The evaluation will also consider information provided relative to corrective actions taken to resolve problems on pas t or existing contracts.   The evaluators may contact references and parties other than those identified by the offeror, and information received may be used in the evaluation of the offerors past performance.  While the government may elect to consider d ata obtained from other sources, the burden of providing current, accurate and complete past/present performance information rests with the offeror. 		 2.1.3  An offeror with no past performance shall be evaluated as  neutral.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past/present performance history, while rated neutral in past/present performance, may not represent the most  advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors. Offerors without previous Government contracts shall also be rated neutral. 		2.1.4  Currency and Trends: The SSEB will consider the currency and trends of the performance information while conducting its performance evaluation.  For the purpose of this solicitation, currency is performance occurring within the last three (3) year s prior to the solicitation release date.  Within this period, performance occurring later in the period may have greater significance than work occurring earlier in the period.  For example, performance information for work occurring between September of 2002 and the date of the proposal may have greater importance than performance information for work occurring from August of 2000 through August 2002.  	2.1.5  Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposals, e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunit y to respond or to resolve minor clerical errors. 	2.1.6  In the evaluation of Past Performance, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the performance risk the contractor poses.   PAST/PRESENT PERFORMANCE RATINGS ARE:  Very Low Risk	Offers past/present performance record provides essentially no doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Low Risk	Offers past/present performance record provides little doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Moderate Risk	Offers past/present performance record, although satisfactory, provides some doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. High Risk	Offers past/present performance record provides substantial doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral/Unknown Risk	The offer has no relevant past performance record. A through search was unable to identify any past/present performance information 2.2 TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION   2.2.1 The evaluation of each technical proposal will access and measure the ability of  the offeror to provide the specified requirements outlined the Request for Proposal (RFP).  The areas of significance are: 1.   Ability to meet the salient physical and functional performance characteristics specified in the solicitation.  2.   Delivery 2.2.2 ABILITY TO MEET THE SALIENT PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL  PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIED IN THE Solicitation. The vendor shall clearly identify the proposed item by brand name, if any; and the make or model number.  The vendor should include descriptive literature  such as illustrations, or a clear reference to descriptive data or information.  The vendor must clearly describe any modification that the offeror plans to make in the specifications.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate equal products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. Unless the offeror clearl y indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an equal product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.   2.2.3 DELIVERY- The vendor shall also identify the number of days it will take to provide the requested items.  Failure to do so will indicate an acceptance of a delivery date 45 days ARO. TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS:  Color Rating 	Evaluation Criteria Blue	Proposal meets all solicitation requirements, demonstrates an excellent understanding of the requirements and has salient features that offer significant advantages to the Government.   Excellent in all respects. Advantages/strengths not offset by dis advantages/weaknesses. Very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting Government requirements.   Green	 Proposal meets solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to the Government over basic RFP requirements.  Where there were areas of concern, clarifications given  by contractor were acceptable. Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant. Good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government requirements.   Yellow	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements, but offers disadvantages (weaknesses) outweighing other advantages (strengths). Example little or no experience cited; weak proposal; mimics RFP language rather than expressing offerors approach  or understanding of the RFP. Probability of success considered less than full confidence (high risk) Pink	Proposal meets some but not all the RFP requirements.  Proposal does not address all required RFP criteria; little or no experience to the extent that overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies that may be capabl e of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of proposal. Probability of success is questionable without further explanation by offeror. (unacceptable risk).   Red 	Proposal demonstrates little to no understanding of the requirements; or approach fails to adequately meet acceptable performance expectations.  Proposal contains major errors; omissions or deficiencies and these conditions cannot be corrected without a m ajor rewrite or resubmission. There is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements 2.3 	PRICE EVALUATION - The Source Selection Board will conduct comparative evaluations of offers concerning price.  The determination that a proposed price is reasonable should be based on competitive quotation/offers. If the price is determined to be rea sonable in comparison to the other offerers price a GO rating will be given, if found to be unreasonable, a NO GO rating will be assigned to the price evaluation factor.  2.3.1	Discounts:  Prompt payment discounts will not be considered in the  evaluation of offers.  2.3.2  Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly  unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 3.0 Procedures for Recording the Evaluation (e.g. Worksheets for recording Evaluators ratings with supportive narrative).  3.1 Each SSEB memb er shall prepare an individual worksheet for each offeror on the factors of Past Performance and Technical.  3.2 Upon the completion of the individual evaluations of Past Performance and Technical Information, the Chairman will assemble the board members.  The group will reach a consensus overall rating in Past Performance and Technical Factors for each offeror.  Overall strengths and weaknesses will be combined on the consensus rating sheet(s).  In the event the group cannot reach a consensus rating on an individual offeror, majority and minority reports will be prepared.  3.3 The SSEB will rate each offeror independently and not make comparisons to other offerors concerning Past Performance and Technical.  SSEB will prepare a summary of findings providing an overview of each offers ratings, strengths and weakness, and othe r pertinent facts.  This summary and all SSEB documentation shall be presented to the SSA.  The SSA will make any comparative analysis and determine which proposal offers best value to the Government.
