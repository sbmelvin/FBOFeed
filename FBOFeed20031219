<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to AT&T Government Solutions. The estimate cost of this award is $474,000. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory. This procurement is for performing Operational Test and Evaluation of New DB15 Software Version Releases for the Naval Network and Space Operations Command (NNSOC), Dahlgren, Virginia, and is a follow-up award to a uniquely qualified source. Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government. To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the process of the program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay program completion by a minimum of 8 to 10 months and nearly double the cost. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion by the Government. POC: Department of the Interior; Attention: Susan Benik, 381 Elden Street - MS2510, Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be faxed to the attention of Susan Benik at (703) 787-1022 or emailed to Susan.Benik@mms.gov. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a Progressive Wave Tube (PWT) Control System Upgrade. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from M+P International who is the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements.

This control system upgrade is required to maintain software and hardware compatiblity with the existing PWT control system.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer for Repair and Modernize 13.8kV Unit Substations.   The work for this requirement consists of, but is not limited to the following: Provide all labor, equipment, tools and materials to demolish and replace several double ended 13.8kV/480V unit substations, miscellaneous cable, switchgear and fencing.  All work elements are located below ground level at interior and exterior locations.   Note:  Some work locations are dedicated to propulsion testing.  All work under this proposed contract in these facilities will be scheduled at the convenience of propulsion testing activities.	Double ended substations will typically be worked one side at a time with one side in service at all times.  Weekend outages to accommodate total Unit Substation replacement with no energized elements may be possible depending on propulsion test operations. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $500,000 to $1,000,000.and the effort shall be completed within 365 calendar days after notice to proceed.		 Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.	Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.		 This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238210 and $12.0 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.      The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about June 4, 2003 with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about July 7, 2003. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.	 An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".	  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office:  Anita.DeMarco-1@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.       The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet at NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page:  http://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=64	   Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

Seeking organizations to perform the following: Develop a program that facilitates the development of infrastructure that will enable protein biomarker discovery in cancer. Core elements of the project: establish a consortium of laboratories that will develop and evaluate the capability of protein detection and measurement technologies to identify proteins relevant to cancer. The project should be conducted by a minimum of three laboratories that will collaborate to utilize the same biological specimens for protein detection and analysis. Apply technology approaches to protein identification and quantitation that include separation techniques and protein detection of identification methods, including high throughput mass spectrometry (SELDI-or MALD-TOF, LC/MS, LC/tandem MS, and affinity methods such as protein chip array, peptide aptamers, and isotope-coded affinity tagging. (This project does not include development of technologies applied to 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis). Facilitate technology engineering that will improve the detection and identification of proteins, digested protein fragments, and peptides in serum. To provide standardized measurements enabling characterization of serum soluble proteins, the laboratories will utilize a minimum of 12 in-bred mouse strain models representing different, well-characterized cancer tumors for serum protein measurement.  The research project will include assessment of protein profiles (molecular signatures) from samples using two approaches: random protein identification in mouse serum and, a targeted candidate approach that utilizes labeled known peptides to identify specific protein moieties identified in the MS approach. The laboratories will develop common resources for sharing among members of the consortium including: specimens (serum and plasma), reagents (monoclonal, polyclonal, and single chain antibodies), and data obtained from the proein measurements.  The consortium will establish a data and resource coordinating center that will facilitate communication and resource exchange for the project. Conditions: The period of performance will be one year with option for additional years. The NCI-Frederick (SAIC-Frederick) anticipates making awards to 1 or more consortiums (each consisting of at least 3 individual laboratories). It is assumed that significant technology will be brought to and developed from research and development conducted on the project.  Contractors are notified that restrictions will be sought on exclusion licensing of some reagents and technologies developed from the project. Data developed from the project will be placed in the public domain (publications or database). Specific Tasks: Develop plan for use of a minumum of 12 individual in-bred mouse strains for acquisition of serum and plasma. Develop reagents for antibodies, proteins and peptide arrays. Develop database and informatics support for archiving and analysis of proteomic data.  Develop standard assay materials, i.e., plasma and sumum, from mouse models.  Sponsor workshops around the design, evaluation, and analysis of technology development and project design and progress assessment.  Develop milestones and deliverables of interest to broad research community.

Expansion anchors shall meet Federal Specification FFS-325.  Chemical anchors shall conform to ASTM-C881.  Conduct 1,000 pound pullout tests on two anchors selected by the Contracting Officer.  Failure of either or both anchors will result in a requirement to test all anchors.  Any anchor that fails the “pull-out” test will be required to be replaced at an adjacent location.  Provide 2’-0” wide access grates with three steel hinges and hasp at locations indicated on the plan.  Where irregularities in the existing wall prevents flush mounting of steel angles, fill spaces between angles and wall with non-shrink grout.

<DESC>I.   Overview of USAID/Rwanda’s Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP), 2004-2009.  Rwanda is a small, landlocked, and densely populated country of 8.2 million people in central Africa.  It’s modern history has been greatly influenced by the 1994 genocide in which nearly one million people died and more moving into exile.  Almost ten years later,  the country continues to rebuild itself. The ISP assistance goal is to Increase Economic Development and Improve Well-being in Rwanda.  The areas of intervention proposed in the strategy are all areas in which USAID has worked successfully in Rwanda and in which USAID has a strong comparative advantage.  In analyzing the priorities for the ISP, support to the GOR’s decentralization program emerged as one of the best opportunities to encourage grassroots political, social, and economic development.  

II.   The ISP includes three strategic objectives (SO).  They are:
Democracy and Governance (SO5): 	Increased citizen participation in post-transition 
					Governance;
Health (SO6):  			Increased use of community health services, 						including HIV/AIDs;
Economic Growth (SO7):  		Expanded economic opportunities in rural areas.

The Health Strategic Objective includes four intermediate results: 1) reinforced capacity for implementation of the decentralization policy in target health districts; 2) increased access to select essential health commodities and community health services; 3) improved quality of community health services; and 4) improved community level responses to health issues.  When referring to “community health services” in the context of the strategy, USAID/Rwanda envisions an optimized health care system which, irrespective of the location where services are actually provided, responds to community needs.  Such a system fully integrates the community as an essential partner, along with health professionals and local elected leaders, in all phases of service design, financing, and delivery. 

III. The purpose of this SOW is to obtain technical services to help the Mission meet defined performance measures necessary to achievement of both SO6 and SO5, in particular, the SO6 intermediate result of Reinforced capacity for implementation of the decentralization policy in target health districts, and the SO5 intermediate result of Enhanced implementation of the decentralization policy in target local areas.  Within the decentralization domain, the proposed contract will have three levels of focus:  i) national-level strengthening for planning, financial systems, and policy in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Local Administration, Information, and Social Affairs; ii) district-level capacity building with local governments in 64 Administrative Districts (ADs) that cover 20 Health Districts (HD), and with the health facilities for which the ADs and HDs are jointly responsible; and c) local-level capacity building to facilitate management of Health Centers and to provide for sustainable finance, through formation of community-based health pre-payment schemes.  The proposed Decentralization and Health Financing contract will be for a five-year period, for up to an estimated total of US$30 million, including US$8.96 million for a Contractor-managed District Incentive Fund.






IV.  Other procurements for USAID/Rwanda’s Health SO:  USAID/Rwanda will use additional mechanisms to implement the new strategy including a cooperative agreement for Quality Community Health, and a partner (or partners) for Community Action for Health, with a strong emphasis on HIV.AIDS.   Efforts under the Quality Community Health Request will address Rwanda’s challenges and opportunities in the technical domains of HIV/AIDS, reproductive & maternal health (including family planning) and child survival/malaria/nutrition at two levels of focus:  i) national level systems support (i.e. policy/norms/standards, professional training, institutional strengthening); and ii) integrated service delivery in the same 20 Health Districts as the Decentralization and Health Financing contractor outlined above.  This Cooperative Agreement (CA) is estimated at US$75 million over a five year period.  

These two instruments (Decentralization and Health Financing, and Quality Community Health) will work in the same geographic areas, but target separate administrative and technical institutions as different points of entry to address the common objective of increasing use of community health services.  The intent is that USAID implementing partners will serve as the catalyst to effective decentralization of health care to the communities.

USAID/Rwanda will convene a Pre-Award conference for both procurements at the beginning of February, 2004, in Kigali.

The soon to be issued RFP and RFA documents will be posted to FBO and FedGrants approximately (15-26) days from this Synopsis posting.  The solicitation numbers will be RFP 623-04-005 and RFA 623-04-006.  No additional notice will be given concerning the RFP/RFA Solicitation date of issuance/posting.  Once the RFP/RFA Solicitation is posted to http://www.fbo.gov/website, this will allow the potential bidders/applicants to submit a proposal/application.  The office issuing the RFP/RFA Solicitation will NOT mail forms or hard RFP/RFA copies out.  The cover letter to the solicitations will advise that there will be a pre-Award conference in Kigali, Rwanda in February 2004 at a date to be confirmed and included in the RFP/RFA.  Questions and Answers resulting from the pre-proposal conference will be posted to FBO and FedGrants by issuing an Amendment to the RFP/RFA Solicitations.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of MEMS Exchange (MX).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.

DARPA is soliciting innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) process module additions to the MEMS Exchange distributed fabrication network, with the intention of furthering the MEMS Exchange (MX) program goal of providing flexible access to complex MEMS fabrication technology in a wide variety of materials and to a broad multi-disciplinary user base, pursuant to making possible novel devices otherwise unattainable via inflexible foundries. Although complete, self-contained, multi-mask process modules that can serve as "standard" processes are of most interest, single process steps (e.g., a film deposition, an etch capability) will still be considered if exceptionally novel and compelling. Emphasis will be given to multi-mask process modules that are amenable to combination with other modules to yield fully integrated microsystems. Among the relevant set of technologies deemed beneficial to the MEMS Exchange service are: (1) generic, widely-applicable, standard processes-e.g., surface-micromachining, Silicon On Insulator (SOI) micromachining, metal micromachining, etc.-that yield fully functional MEMS devices; (2) process technologies that yield 3-dimensional structures; and (3) generally applicable technologies capable of packaging MEMS devices under environments suitable for optimum performance. Given that one of the main objectives of the MEMS Exchange program is to insure self-sustained operation of the MEMS Exchange service beyond the end of the program, additional consideration will likely be given to process modules perceived to be in highest demand or capable of satisfying a crucial need by any of the DARPA MEMS programs.

One of the drivers behind the interest in self-contained, multi-mask process modules is to see if a "standard" MEMS process flow can be identified that is general enough to be used by the majority of MEMS designers in a given class, yet still capable of attaining performance on par with or approaching that of a fully custom process. Such a "universal" MEMS process (or a set of them, one for each "class"), if even possible, would be highly beneficial to the MEMS community, since its ability to support a large number of products could substantially raise the volume of wafers processed per month, thereby greatly lowering the cost of the process, and thus, of the products it services. In essence, such a process might allow the MEMS industry to enjoy the same standardization advantages that the extremely high volume integrated circuit industry presently enjoys. 

MEMS devices that harness the material and process flexibility provided by the MEMS Exchange distributed fabrication network are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, with its ability to reduce both size and power consumption in a myriad of sensor, communication, actuation, and information processing devices, has been identified as a key enabling technology for military platforms in all areas. Among the many examples of high payoff applications of MEMS technologies are micromechanical logic circuits for munitions safe-and-arming devices, micromechanical vibrating resonators for frequency selection and generation in miniaturized communication transceivers, programmable micromechanical gratings for remote toxic gas sensors, movable micromirrors for optical switching, micro fuel cells and engines for portable, long-lasting power generation, and chip-scale atomic clocks for portable GPS and ultra-secure communications. The most recent advancements in MEMS technology have invariably required participation from researchers from a widely diverse set of backgrounds, many of whom do not have access to the full spectrum of MEMS technologies.  In allowing and encouraging the use of a wide variety of materials and fabrication processes by a broad multi-disciplinary user base, the development and enhancement of the MEMS Exchange should prove instrumental in providing the accessibility to MEMS technology required for a myriad of present and future MEMS-enabled devices for military platforms. In addition, MEMS Exchange can serve as a much-needed fabrication infrastructure for low or medium volume production of MEMS-enabled products for DoD applications.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. Such teaming, however, is not required, and offerings from compelling individual efforts will be given the same consideration as that for teams. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-10 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.


PROGRAM SCOPE

This addition to the MEMS Exchange program is meant to support short-term efforts, on the order of one year or less, that should culminate in the insertion of new process modules into the MEMS Exchange service that greatly enhance its overall capability and increase its user base. Several awards in amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000, and all totaling $1 million, are expected to be made during the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. A web site-http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-04-10/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 04-10, MEMS Exchange, Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on MEMS Exchange, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and seven (7) copies of the proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the proposal (in PDF - preferred, MS-Word readable, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM). Also include on each disk the one-slide PowerPoint file summarizing your proposal, as described under the Proposal Format sub-section of Section I of this BAA. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-10, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 04-10), and must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 P.M., local time, Monday, February 9, 2004, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 04-10 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in MEMS Exchange. 

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 04-10.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award a sole source order under Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00104-02-G-A404 to Raytheon RTSC, 2555 Ellsmere Ave, Norfolk, VA 23322. This order will provide the FY04 procurement of services for life cycle support of the AN/USC-38(V) Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communication (SATCOM) terminals, AN/WSC-6(V) Super High Frequency (SHF) SATCOM terminals, and Global Broadcast Service (GBS) terminals.  Since Raytheon is the original designer of the AN/USC-38(V), AN/WSC-6(V), and GBS terminals, Raytheon is the only company that possesses the detailed knowledge and expertise to assess the efficacy of substitute components or to redesign modules and components as necessary to resolve parts obsolescence problems. The requirement is for Raytheon to technically review the three terminals and create a database identifying all parts/components of the AN/USC-38(V), AN/WSC-6(V), and GBS terminals that will become obsolete within a two-year period.  The effort will include: 1) the monitoring of Bills of Material (BOMs / Parts Lists) for the AN/USC-38(V), AN/WSC-6(V), and GBS product lines; 2) conducting obsolescence reviews as required for MIL-SPEC parts; and 3) recommending either lifetime buys or MIL-SPEC part substitutions for all parts/components that will become obsolete within a two-year period.  Raytheon will establish a database to support this effort; the database will provide the availability of substitute electronic components, including industrial and commercial material. The database will be provided to the Government at the completion of this effort. The contemplated order will require the contractor to commence performing these services immediately after order award. The expected award date of this order is January 15, 2004. Note 22

<DESC>CANCELLATION OF SOLICITATION.  On July 1, 2003, the National Park Service (NPS) issued a Prospectus for Guided Snowmobile and Snowcoach Tours for Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway.  The prospectus solicited offers for guided snowmobile tours and for guided snowcoach tours.  On December 16, 2003, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered the NPS to follow the rule published on January 22, 2001.  This rule will phase out recreational snowmobile use in the three parks following the current winter season in favor of guided tours via mass transit snowcoaches.  For this winter season the rule provides specific limits for guided snowmobile tours in Yellowstone National Park.  NPS concessions regulations allow the NPS to cancel a solicitation at any time prior to the award of a concessions contract if such action is appropriate in the public interest (36 CFR 51.11).  Because the guided snowmobile tours solicited in the prospectus could occur for only this winter season, the NPS has decided to cancel the solicitation for the guided snowmobile tours.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.	Due to system character limitations, the RFP is contained in a separate link to this synopsis.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/FEMA, NETC Acquisition Section, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Sytel, Inc., an extension of the performance period for contract number EME-1999-CO-0099 for continuation of on-site administrative support services for the Independent Study (IS) Program of the Distance Learning Branch of the Emergency Management Institute at the National Emergency Training Center located in Emmitsburg, Maryland.  DHS/FEMA is in the process of issuing a competitive solicitation that will be synopsized on FedBizOpps in December, 2003.  It is anticipated that the period of performance for the current contract will be extended for three (3) months with one-month option periods.  Services to be performed shall include, but are not limited to, student record management, data entry of enrollments, addresses, email information, courses, course history, and certificates of completion; issuance of transcripts; ordering and inventory control; test scoring; packaging and mailing student materials; marketing; customer service to include written correspondence; telephone and email responses to students and training officials on all courses and program areas; statistical and narrative reports; program analysis; presentations as required; and other general office functions required to support the IS program.  This contract also provides program support to the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program, to include reports and statistical data, providing general program information to students and the general public; answering traditional correspondence and email, and providing information on the CERT Independent Study course and related courses.  In addition, the contractor is responsible for coordinating the assignment of continuing education units for course and providing college credits for completed IS courses.  Due to the type of on-site services required, it is necessary to maintain consistency and uninterrupted administrative support services at the facility in order to continue to provide IS courses for emergency personnel and the general public.  It is not economically feasible for a new contractor to mobilize and perform this extensive work effort for 3 months.  Based on Sytel’s comprehensive knowledge of the EMI mission, the complex system which supports the program, it’s integrated support services requirements, familiarity with the program, and it’s ability to provide course accreditation through their affiliation with a college/university, Sytel is in a unique position to provide the administrative support services for the extension period.  Sytel is the only known source that possesses both the intimate knowledge of the independent study program, the resources required to continue continuity of services, and an established affiliation with an accredited college/university for this period.  Entering into a new contract for the period of this extension would be detrimental to the government.  The statutory authority that permits other than full and open competition for this requirement is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<DESC>An award of a sole source contract to Culture Works, Inc. is being considered as a follow-on to an existing contract for performance of a culture-based safety program, the purpose of which is to reduce aircraft mishaps, aviator deaths and injuries by altering the focus of leadership at all levels in Tenth Air Force. These Assessment Modules that will take place during the UTA drill weekends will be steeped in an organizational culture methodology and specifically not a “traditional safety survey” approach. The process is highly interactive between the contractor and unit personnel at all levels; therefore, the contractor must thoroughly understand the correlation between culture, leadership and safety.  The team training will be accomplished on Friday prior to the assessment on Saturday and Sunday.  The assessment process will be a non-intrusive and have minimal impact on normal unit operations. The information gathering phase of the assessment will
be informal and will be conducted to reveal the thought processes of the unit. The Training
Modules will be based on the culture issues revealed in the assessment phase. The contractor will present interactive training modules based on the subjects of culture,
communication, performance documentation, and counseling and team. The results using the two modules are synergistic in nature.  Assessment followed immediately by accurate training creates appropriate attention on the safety issues identified in the process.  The four-day assessment/training cycle assures maximum benefit for the visited
unit. This contract is planned to be awarded IAW FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A).  The NAICS
code is 541690.

<DESC>The 11t Contracting Squadron, Bolling AFB DC intends to award a simplified acquisition purchase order on a sole source basis to Verizon Federal Inc.  The purpose of this procurement is for the renewal of Bolling's annual Internet subscription service.  The requirement is being acquired Sole Source based on the proprietary rights established by the Verizon telecommunication network currently in use. Replacing Verizon’s  phone lines would allow other Internet service providers to compete and provide service, but this is a costly solution and would need to be done annually to foster a competitive environment for vendors.  The option to replace phone lines annually is not in the best interest of the government and therefore not a viable solution.  Award of this solicitation will be made on or about 09 DEC 03.  NAICS Code: 518111.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to award a sole source contract for facilitator mentoring and technical services in the area of Relability Centered Maintainence to Aladon, LLC.  In April 2001, after extensive market research and a full and open competition, Aladon was awarded a contract to provide Reliability Centered Maintenance training and technical services to the DRPM-AAA program. Since that award, the RCM process introduced by Aladon has analyzed nearly 80% of the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle using a process fully compliant with SAE standard JA-1011.  OSD guidance, as stated in the Office of the Secretary of Defense guide entitled Designing and Assessing Supportability in DoD Weapon Systems, published in April 2003, strongly encourages the use of RCM in acquisition programs and suggests that the RCM process chosen should comply with SAE standard JA-1011. Only Aladon can provide the continued certified RCM support, compliant with the SAE standard, required by DRPM-AAA.  Period of performance will be for one year beginning in approximately February 2004. Task orders will be issued on an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) basis, in order to to meet on-going and emerging requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP)'s to award one firm-fixed price contract for the design and construction (design-build) of the new 1st Brigade Barracks at Ft. Drum, New York. Design and construction shall comply with the specifications and requirements contained in the RFP.  This is a one-step solicitation with price evaluation preference for HUBZone small business concerns in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4.  The Government will use a lowest price technically accepted selection approach for this selection.  This solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimu m standards for design and construction quality. The solicitation criteria rely predominately upon military design standards for barracks to meet program specific requirements for the Army's Barracks Program.  The successful Offeror must design and constru ct a complete and useable facility, as described in the RFP documents. The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that gives the Government the greatest confidence in the Offerors ability to meet the Governments requi rements in an affordable manner.   Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the RFP in all aspects of project execution.  A site visit will also be scheduled, for the Offerors, prior to submittal of proposa ls, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site. The proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the technical qualifications and price.  The evaluation process essentially consists of five parts: proposal compliance review, technical/qualit y evaluation, price evaluation, final proposal revision (if discussions are required) and final determination by the SSA.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.  Propo sals will be evaluated on RFP compliance and technical merits.  Price proposals will be evaluated on price only.  Price will not be scored, but will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness through the use of price analysis.  Technical factors are list ed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3.  Within each factor, sub-factors are of equal importance.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors. Technical evaluation includes evaluation of the both the technical proposal and the subcontracting plan.  The criteria for technical evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1 - Past Relevant Experience of Offeror s Team: The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate relevant experience by the physical completion and acceptance of similar and relevant projects within the last seven (7) years.  Factor 2 - Past Performance of Offerors Team: The Offeror as a Des ign-Build Team shall demonstrate at a minimum satisfactory performance, including timely completion of punch list and warranty work, for the projects submitted.  Factor 3 - Qualifications of the Offerors Team:  The Offeror will provide an organization char t and the key personnel resumes for the Offerors Design-Build Team. Factor 4 Ã¢Â€Â“ Subcontracting Plan:  (a) The subcontracting plan shall be submitted in a separate binder labeled Volume III - Subcontracting Plan.  Large business concerns must submit as part of their proposal their subcontracting projections for this project in accordance with FAR Contract Clauses 52.219-8 and 52.219-9.  All large businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan with their technical and price/cost proposals.  The plan should  be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the Offeror inel igible for award of the contract. The submission of the subcontracting plan is in no way advantageous to large businesses over any small business in the evaluation process. (b) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Utilization Plan.  (Applies to all Offerors. )  Offerors shall submit a SDB Utilization Plan, to include the following information: (1)  Identification of each SDB concern proposed and the work each is to perform. (2)  Targets expressed in dollars and percentages representing each SDB concerns partic ipation of the total contract value. (3)  Total target value of all SDB participation, expressed in dollars and percentages, of the total contract value. Factor 5 Ã¢Â€Â“ Variant Changes to Technical Requirements. Offerors who intend to submit changes (bett erments) to Section 01010 and/or drawings shall define these changes in Factor 5. A betterment is defined as any component of system which exceeds the minimum requirements stated in the Request For Proposal. If the offeror does not intend to make changes (betterments) to the 01010 Section and/or drawings, the offero r must provide a statement as such in Factor 5. The price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder labeled Volume II - Price Proposal.  The sections shall parallel the submission requirements identified in the bid schedule.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct the North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) for: Solicitation: 13SSC-O-02-38, entitled Sources Sought Synopsis. A detailed review and analysis of the subject work-scope reveals that while engineering services remains a significant element of the work-scope, the preponderance of the work-scope focuses on Research & Development and Test, therefore necessitating this change in the NAICS Code.   The NAICS Code as reads:  541330, with a size standard of $4,000,000 is hereby changed to read:  541710, with a size standard of 1000. All other information remains unchanged.=20

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is one of several bureaus of the U.S. Department of Commerce, a cabinet level agency of the executive branch of the United States of America.

In the 21st century every aspect of the NOAA mission faces new urgency given the intensifying national needs of the environment, the economy, and public safety. The NOAA role in facing these challenges is to assess and predict environmental changes, protect life and property, provide decision makers with reliable scientific information, manage the Nation's living marine and coastal resources, and foster global environmental stewardship. 

VISION - 	To move NOAA into the 21st century scientifically and operationally, in the same interrelated manner as the environment that we observe and forecast, while recognizing the link between our global economy and our planet's environment.

MISSION - 	To understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs.

MISSION GOALS - 

1)	Protect, restore and manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem-based management.

2)	Understand climate variability and change to enhance society's ability to plan and respond.

3)	Serve society's needs for weather and water information.

4)	Support the Nation's commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation.


National Ocean Service (NOS)

The NOS mission is to manage society's uses of coastal ecosystems t sustain their natural resources and services.  With nearly 1200 employees and a budget of $500 million, the NOS ranks fourth in size among the five NOAA line offices.   Described as a "national leader for coastal stewardship" and "the primary Federal agency working to preserve the nation's coastal resources through observation, measurement, assessment, and management," NOS helps to meet the challenges facing U.S. coastal regions.

NOS has the widest range of coastal program responsibilities and missions of any Federal agency.  By taking an integrated approach to coastal issues, NOS addresses the complexities of the coast.  As the Federal partner to the 34 coastal states and territories under the Coastal Zone Management Act, NOS is responsible for the 95,000 miles of U.S. coastline.  NOS administers the world's largest system of marine protected areas.  NOS is the Nation's natural resource trustee in the event of major offshore oil spills, and supports a wide range of research, including the forecasting of natural hazards such as the onset of harmful algal blooms or red tides, to better understand and advance the sustainable use of coastal resources.  NOS is active in mapping U.S. coral reefs, monitoring coral reef health, and supporting state and territorial efforts to protect local reefs.  NOS provides critical navigation services to the maritime community - nautical charts and products, hydrographic and shoreline data, accurate positioning data, and real-time/forecast water levels, tides and currents conditions.  


Office of Coast Survey (OCS)

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is one of several bureaus of the U.S. Department of Commerce, a cabinet level agency of the executive branch of the United States of America.

In the 21st century every aspect of the NOAA mission faces new urgency given the intensifying national needs of the environment, the economy, and public safety. The NOAA role in facing these challenges is to assess and predict environmental changes, protect life and property, provide decision makers with reliable scientific information, manage the Nation's living marine and coastal resources, and foster global environmental stewardship. 

VISION - 	To move NOAA into the 21st century scientifically and operationally, in the same interrelated manner as the environment that we observe and forecast, while recognizing the link between our global economy and our planet's environment.

MISSION - 	To understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs.

MISSION GOALS - 

1)	Protect, restore and manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem-based management.

2)	Understand climate variability and change to enhance society's ability to plan and respond.

3)	Serve society's needs for weather and water information.

4)	Support the Nation's commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation.


National Ocean Service (NOS)

The NOS mission is to manage society's uses of coastal ecosystems t sustain their natural resources and services.  With nearly 1200 employees and a budget of $500 million, the NOS ranks fourth in size among the five NOAA line offices.   Described as a "national leader for coastal stewardship" and "the primary Federal agency working to preserve the nation's coastal resources through observation, measurement, assessment, and management," NOS helps to meet the challenges facing U.S. coastal regions.

NOS has the widest range of coastal program responsibilities and missions of any Federal agency.  By taking an integrated approach to coastal issues, NOS addresses the complexities of the coast.  As the Federal partner to the 34 coastal states and territories under the Coastal Zone Management Act, NOS is responsible for the 95,000 miles of U.S. coastline.  NOS administers the world's largest system of marine protected areas.  NOS is the Nation's natural resource trustee in the event of major offshore oil spills, and supports a wide range of research, including the forecasting of natural hazards such as the onset of harmful algal blooms or red tides, to better understand and advance the sustainable use of coastal resources.  NOS is active in mapping U.S. coral reefs, monitoring coral reef health, and supporting state and territorial efforts to protect local reefs.  NOS provides critical navigation services to the maritime community - nautical charts and products, hydrographic and shoreline data, accurate positioning data, and real-time/forecast water levels, tides and currents conditions.

<DESC>A-10 ACQUISITION STRATEGY RFI

This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). The intent is to request information concerning how best to perform management of the A-10.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) is seeking information to explore the full range of management and support options for the A-10 aircraft fleet worldwide including complete CLS, public/private partnership, and organic support.  We are seeking information to develop an acquisition strategy to support the A-10 aircraft fleet from CY2007 through 2028, the expected life of the weapon system.

The current LMSI A/OA-10 Prime Contract includes scope to provide support to the A-10 System Program Office necessary to fulfill its mission to sustain, modify, and integrate the changes to the aircraft and subsystems.  The ordering period for the current contract expires in CY2006.  The A-10 SPO anticipates the following effort to be included in the future work scope:  Worldwide sustainment of the A-10 fleet, Service Life Upgrades to the aircraft structure and various component parts, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program, System Engineering, System Safety (Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness), Systems Integration, Accident Mishap Investigation, Repair, Avionics Upgrades and other weapon system modifications. 

Potential offerors are requested to provide their recommended approach with correlating benefits to the government on how best to manage the A-10 weapon system, information on current products and services meeting the needs of the Air Force in supporting the A-10 weapon system, and a no-cost Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) delineating expected life cycle program cost and savings.  Please submit two copies of your response in an executive summary format not to exceed 5 pages.  If your response includes information you consider to be proprietary, please mark the information in accordance with regulatory guidance.  Please do not include company brochures or other marketing type information.  

A Market Research Industry Day will be held approximately 17 February 2004, in the OO-ALC/LC Mature and Proven Aircraft conference room (Bldg. 1285) from 0800 – 1500 to provide an opportunity for “one-on-one” meetings with team personnel and address contractor questions.  Please watch the website for further announcement on the Industry Day.

Final vendor RFI responses are expected by close of business 3 February 2004.  

The government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  Copies of the submitted information will be reproduced for review by the A-10 Acquisition IPT.  Results may be used to develop future A-10 Acquisition Strategy.
For questions, comments or RFI response, please contact:

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is implementing a strategic sourcing program to increase efficiencies and drive savings across the various operating and staff divisions.  As part of this strategic sourcing initiative, a Request for Information is being issued to locate potential sources to provide office furniture to DHHS.  To respond to this Request for Information, a firm must have a current GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) covering office furniture.  If a firm is in the process of obtaining a GSA FSS, the contract must be in place and orderable by March 31, 2004 to be considered.    

Attached to this Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information document in an Excel workbook.  The Request for Information document includes an introduction plus five sections.  Section A is DHHS Information, Section B is Supplier Information, Section C is Delivery Requirements, Section D is Product Requirements and Section E is Service Requirements.  The scope, estimated dollar expenditure for office furniture and potential contract term are contained in Section A.  DHHS will use the information submitted by firms in the Request for Information document to identify GSA FSS contract holders that have the resources and capabilities to best support all or part of this requirement.  It is intended that the subsequent solicitation, if any, will result in one or more awards of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against GSA FSS contracts.    

The format of the resulting solicitation is to be determined based on industry response and could include a request for quotation, request for proposal, reverse auction or other method.  The solicitation may include all or any subset of the items listed in the Request for Information document, and may also include additional items that are not listed but are within the scope of the requirement.  The solicitation will be issued to those firms that are determined to be highly qualified based on a review of responses provided to each section of the Request for Information document.  For the purpose of efficiency, DHHS reserves the right to limit the number of firms receiving a solicitation to those determined to be most highly qualified.  Solicitation recipients may be limited to small businesses or a subset thereof, at the sole discretion of DHHS, based on information provided by industry.  DHHS strongly encourages small business participation either individually or as a joint venture, team, consortium or similar arrangement.   

Interested firms are required to complete in full the attached Request for Information document.  Incomplete Request for Information documents may not be reviewed by DHHS.  Complete Request for Information documents will be reviewed and assigned points based on the following criteria, which are described further in the Request for Information document:

Supplier Information 		10 points;
Delivery Requirements	10 points;
Product Requirements		40 points;
Service Requirements		40 points.

The complete document must be received by close of business Thursday, January 15, 2004.  Interested firms must include a copy of their current GSA FSS as part of their submission.  Send the Request for Information response in electronic format and GSA FSS document to Ms. Kesa Russell, Mail Stop 336E No. 17, HHH Building, 200 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC  20201.  Firms are encouraged to email the Excel portion of the response to kesa.russell@hhs.gov.  Responses received after the due date will not be considered.  

This Sources Sought shall not be construed as a request for quotation/bid/proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  There is not a solicitation document prepared or available.  This Sources Sought/Request for Information does not commit the Government to pay any cost related to preparation or submission of a response.

The consultant will be asked to perform the following:
1.	Review draft documents, modify or create documents and provide recommendations 
concerning:
a.	Issues related to establishing a higher education consortium such as tuition, course development, program control, accreditation, student records and general administration
b.	Recommendations for a Program of Studies for upper division classes in the area of Security Management
c.	Availability of classes in distance learning formats from selected partners
d.	Identification and proposed solutions to accreditation issues
       The project will require travel to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The transportation estimate should be based on 3 trips.  Lodging and per diem will be paid at government rates and therefore these costs are not needed.

Estimated project hours for completion of project is 120 hours.  
Initial evaluation criteria consists of:

Experience evaluating federal training programs
Familiarity with Accreditation agencies and requirements
Experience working with institutions of higher education
Experience with Federal Agencies

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS, WITH THE PURPOSE OF GAINING KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES RELATIVE TO NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE 561210, SIZE STANDARD: $30M. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  REQUIREMENT NASA-Ames Research Center (ARC)has a requirement to procure support services for the following functional areas:  .       Industrial Hygiene  ·   Health Physics .	    Occupational Safety ·    Construction Safety Engineering ·	   Fire Protection Engineering ·   Voluntary Protection Program ·  Injury/Illness Data Analysis ·  Emergency Response Program ·    Training (Safety, Health, Medical, Emergency Response) ·	     Computer Support/Management Services .       Health Unit Operations  ·  Fitness Center Operations ·	Employee Assistance Program The contractor will be required to provide services in all of the disciplines listed above.	A complete description of the aforementioned functional areas is available in the draft Statement of Requirements (SOR), under the NASA-Ames Research Center web Site. BACKGROUND From 1993 through 1999, the stated requirement, which had also included Environmental Services, was divided between two separate contracts: 1) Medical Services was awarded under a CPFF/LOE type contract; and, 2) Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene and Environmental, was awarded CPAF.  The decision to award the follow-on requirement to one contractor was believed to be a more cost effective approach to managing the programs.   As a result, the procurement was competed, and a CPAF contract was awarded March 2, 2000 to PAI, Inc., a small, woman-owned, disadvantaged business.  The period of performance included a three-year base period and one two-year option. The estimated cost is $38Mil. Completion is scheduled for March 2005.  Due to internal restructuring, transition of resources and budget constraints, ARC believes that dividing the requirements once again under two separate contracts for the next follow-on effort, is the best approach to managing the resources in today's economy, while opening the procurement to a broader range of competitive sources.  Environmental Services will be posted under a separate sources sought announcement.  ARC contemplates awarding a performance-based Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Contract for five (5) years; a two-year basic period, a two-year option period, following by a one-year option period. Requirements will be requested on Contract Task Orders (CTOs) issued under the basic contract. Offerors having the specialized qualifications and capabilities outlined in the SOR, should submit a capability statement in 5 pages or less, to Sharon Carlino, Contract Specialist, Mail Stop 241-1, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000 no later than 6:00PM EST, January 14, 2004.  Reference RFP2-38287 on all correspondence.   Qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement under Full and Open Competition Procedures.    Responses should contain the following information:  1) Company name, address, point of contact, phone, fax, e-mail, and website (if applicable)  2) Size of business, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, HUB Zone, 8(a), or woman-owned for NAICs code 561210, size standard $30M; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); 3) Company capabilities in all functional areas as they relate to the attached SOR. In responding to this element, please create a table, as described below:	   a) List the following functions: Industrial Hygiene, Health Physics, Occupational Safety, Construction Safety Engineering, Fire Protection Engineering, Voluntary Protection Program, Injury/Illness Data Analysis, Emergency Response Program, Training, Computer Support, Medical Services, Fitness Center Operations, Employee Assistance Program.      b) In the adjacent column, state the number of years experience your company has in each functional area. 4) Relevant work performed in the past five (5) years.  Include contract number and type, technical description, dollar amount, period of performance, customer references, name and phone number. Also include relevant work in collaboration with the Occupational Health and Safety community and work that facilitates working partnerships within the industry.  5) Please comment on any aspects of the SOR, particularly as they relate to the performance-based approach to managing the requirements. All questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or fax). Telephone calls will not be accepted.  No solicitation exists. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   Failure to respond to this synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EOI) AND REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ):  DISMANTLING AND DEMOLITION AT Y-12 NATIONAL SECURITY COMPLEX*****

PURPOSE*****

BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (Company) is acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22800 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at the Y-12 National Security Complex, and soliciting expressions of interest for its Infrastructure Reduction Program at the Y-12 National Security Complex located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The scopes of work for this dismantling and demolition work will also contain deactivation, decontamination, remediation, transportation and disposal of waste material. The value of the dismantling and demolition work is estimated to be $9.9 million for the General Order Agreement (GOA) over a thirty-six (36) month period - base period eighteen (18) months and an option period of eighteen (18) months. Interested Small Businesses must have the capabilities to handle the transportation and disposal of a range of waste materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead-based paint, PCBs, and other contaminates including low level radiological waste).  It is anticipated to award five (5) GOA awardees under this procurement action. Award of any dismantling and demolition work is contingent upon funding for these task releases, and actual work award will be at the task release level.  It is the intent of the Company to secure Small Business dismantling and demolition subcontractors capable of performing the required activities for the upcoming task releases. *****

This expression of interest (EOI) does not constitute an invitation for bids or a request for proposal.  This request is for the purpose of identifying prospective and qualified small business firms.  Responses received will be used for planning purposes and determining potential candidates for subsequent procurement actions, if any. It is the Company¡¦s intent to make this procurement a Small Business Set-Aside. Firms that do not respond affirmatively to all participation criteria contained in the expression of interest, you will not be eligible for subsequent procurement actions. After evaluating responses to this EOI, the Company will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested to allow for a competitive Small Business Set-Aside procurement. If so, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications to the qualified small businesses that responded to this EOI. If it is determined that a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are not available, the Company will issue a Request for Qualifications to small and large businesses.*****

Technical documents for this project may contain Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) and Official Use Only (OUO) information which requires special information security preparations on the part of the short listed subcontractors prior to receiving the RFP. All subcontractor personnel working on this project must be United States citizens.*****

PROJECT DESCRIPTION*****

The scope of work consists of providing all labor, supervision, tools, equipment, material and services to perform the dismantling, demolition, deactivation, decontamination, remediation, characterization, transportation and disposal of waste material.. The work location is at the Y-12 National Security Complex and physical access to the site will be from Tennessee State Route 95/Bear Creek Road and/or Second Street. The age of the structures ranges from pre-1950s to late 1990s. The buildings anticipated for demolition in the base period range from 198 sq.ft. to 45,416 sq.ft. The demolition plan for the option period is still under development. The work location does not require Q-Cleared workers, but all on-site personnel must be United States citizens with DOE issued identification badges and vehicle passes. The offeror will be required to obtain escort agreement approval and provide Q-Cleared escorts for uncleared workers working in the protected area. Work performed under the Infrastructure Reduction Program for BWXT Y-12 requires the successful subcontractor(s) to abide by the terms of the Resolution agreed to and signed by BWXT Y-12 and the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council on July 15, 2002.  A copy of the Resolution will be made available to you at the Pre-Bid Meeting.*****

Dismantling and Demolition activities at the Y-12 Complex must be in accordance with the Price-Anderson Amendments Act 10 CFR Part 830, Nuclear Safety Management; Subpart A, Quality Assurance Requirements.
Contaminates of concern are as follows:
a) Uranium and daughter products;
b) Asbestos;
c) PCBs in oils and paint;
d) Lead;
e) Heavy metals;
f) Mercury;
g) Transite siding;
h) Freon*****

Performance concerns:
a) Proximity to high voltage electric lines;
b) Security restrictions;
c) Difficult access to the site;
d) Proximity to active overhead utility piping;
e) Large overhead piping, equipment, and cranes in buildings;
f) Radiologically contaminated equipment and buildings;
g) Removal of large overhead systems and reroute of systems with attached active communication lines.*****

PROCUREMENT PROCESS*****

The Company intends to award to five (5) Awardees under the Demolition and Dismantling GOA that are qualified Small Businesses that best meet the Companys goals and objectives for demolition and dismantling.  Selection will be based on best-value using a three-phased approach of an Expression of Interest (EOI), Request for Qualifications (RFQ), and Request for Proposals (RFP)*****

Phase 1, Expression of Interest, will determine if a sufficient number of qualified small businesses are interested. If there is adequate interest in the small business community to proceed to Phase 2, then the strategy remains a Small Business Set Aside. Should there be insufficient small businesses expressing interest to provide adequate competition in the bid process,  the acquisition strategy will revert to full and open competition and include both large and small businesses that expressed interest. It should be noted that the threshold for the number of companies demonstrating an interest must be significantly greater than the number needed to complete the proposal process.*****

Phase 2, Request for Qualifications, will request that firms respond to evaluation factors regarding Past Performance & Experience, Technical Capabilities, and Organization & Personnel Qualifications. The subcontract documents will contain OUO information and require preparations on the part of the short listed firms and the Company prior to issuance of the RFP. From the responses received, the Company will evaluate and score the Statements of Qualification (SOQ) against the RFQ evaluation criteria to down-select to the shortlist to receive the Request for Proposals. No pricing is to be included in Phase 2.*****

Offerors selected to receive the RFP must comply with the Company information security requirements prior to receiving the subcontract documents. All offeror personnel that will be handling, viewing or using Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI) or Official Use Only (OUO) documentation must complete BWXT Y-12 provided training prior to receiving the RFP package including any subtier personnel.*****

 Phase 3 (Request for Proposals) will request that firms respond to technical evaluation factors such as, but not limited to, Project Management Plan & Business Management, Structure & Control, and provide Pricing. A pre-bid meeting will be held in Oak Ridge, TN. The basis for award will be the Offeror offering the best overall value, considering price, the technical RFP submittals, and the SOQs evaluated under the Request for Qualification. Subcontract award is anticipated in First Quarter 04.*****

The Company strongly encourages providing maximum opportunities for small business concerns as a critical and important element of work on the Y-12 Complex. In case of a full and open competition bid, Large Businesses are required to submit a Small Business subcontracting plan as part of their proposal.*****

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HRSA-04-N230
<RESPDATE>123003
<ARCHDATE>12312003
<CONTACT>Mario Checchia, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-3098, Fax 301-443-6038, Email mchecchia@hrsa.gov
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought synopsis to locate capable organizations providing services to develop a comprehensive method for identifying nursing shortage areas and facilities with nursing shortages nationwide.

The purpose of this contract is to research and develop a comprehensive method for identifying health care areas and facilities with a critical shortage of nurses. The goal is to identify key factors in defining facilities with critical nursing shortages.  

The tasks to be carried out under any resultant contract require not only expertise in the subject matters, but also experience in multifaceted issues related to survey design, sampling methodology, data collection, and technical reporting and the expertise and extensive experience necessary to conduct national studies and large scale complex surveys.  The overall objective is to identify key quantifiable factors and develop a proposed methodology to define facilities with critical nursing shortages. This represents a major expansion of any previous methods, which were based solely on data from hospitals.  The inclusion of many more practice settings, the lack of defined staffing standards for these facility types, and uncertainty over data availability, requires an entirely new approach.  Therefore, the proposed contract would develop a methodology informed by analysis of population needs, practice settings, appropriate staffing levels, etc., based on expert opinion and evidence-based information.  
The process requires: I) identifying measures of nursing shortages in each of the various practice settings; 2) identifying key indicators that serve as proxies or predictors for such a shortages; 3) identification and preliminary use of existing data sources; 4) identifying existing models, if any, for identifying nursing shortages, and 5) developing analytical framework for the next phase of the development of the new methodology.

A prospective contractor would convene up to four expert nationally representative panels from nursing homes, state and local public health departments, community health centers, home health agencies, hospices, hospitals, professional associations and other appropriate agencies.  Due to the short period of performance of the proposed contract any contractor must have pre-established relationships with these types of organizations to draw the experts for the panels.  Each panel will address the issues listed above under contract objectives.  The convening of up to four smaller panels will result in a greater opportunity for active participation and discussion than would occur with only one larger panel, so this format assures broader input from interested constituencies on these critical issues.  Panels must collectively address all types of facilities covered by the legislation.
A potential contractor must have an understanding of the training and professional duties of the health profession of  registered nurses, and licensed nurses.  This understanding would be instrumental in thorough data assimilation and analysis. The contractor must have capability to calculate factors influencing the supply of, and demand for the nursing health profession which  will be required to adequately characterize the nursing shortage designation areas and population characteristics and potential facilities with nursing shortages. 

Interested organizations should submit in sufficient detail, capability statements so that the Government may assess their abilities for the above work.  Understanding and experience in studying the health care workforce and how the workforce impacts the health status of the population is critical.  Interested organizations must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience with, and the ability to perform, the above tasks.  Organizations should demonstrate capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include, but not be limited to, both Government and commercial contracts, providing references (with Names, telephone numbers, and email address) and any other information serving to document the organization's capability.

Your submission must be received in this office by 2:00 PM on December  30, 2003, by post office mail, email or fax at the following address:  HHS/HRSA;  Attn:  Mario Checchia;  5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A19;  Rockville, MD 20857;  Tel (301) 443-3098;  Fax (301) 443-5462;  mchecchia@hrsa.gov.  The capability statements shall be not more than twenty-five (25) pages, on 8.5” x 11” paper, with 1” margins and a 12 point, commonly used font such as, Courier or Times Roman in length.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  RESPONSES SHALL NOT INCLUDE COST OR PRICING INFORMATION.

<DESC>In an effort to improve war fighter support and to improve Air Force Weapon Systems sustainment, the Department of the Air Force has established Pathfinder Commodity Councils as part of the Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) effort.  These councils were formed to develop enterprise-wide procurement strategies, integrate customers and suppliers, and drive commonality and standardization.   The Warner Robins Commodity Council has been tasked to develop a sourcing strategy for the 4920 Federal Stock Class (FSC) items. FSC 4920 is defined as Aircraft Maintenance and Repair Shop Specialized Equipment consisting of a diverse groups of items such as accessory kits, cable assemblies, calibration sets, control panels, electronic components, fixtures, engine heaters, maintenance stands, noise suppressors, etc. 

The purpose of this RFI is to identify industry best practices that would improve Air Force readiness, create better customer/ client relationships, reduce cost, and decrease administrative and production lead time.  In addition, we would like feedback regarding impediments and obstacles to doing business with the government.  The attached questionnaire is being provided as a means for the Government to gauge the industrial market climate, and gather recommended improvements to our current business practices.  Industry input into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above objectives.  While we realize that our questionnaire is lengthy, we feel that these areas are critical to the development of a sustainment process that will achieve our objectives, and an acquisition strategy that will benefit both the government and the contracting community. 

The submission of this RFI is for informational purposes only.  No solicitations will be posted at this time.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  

The Warner Robins Logistics Center PSCM Commodity Council plans to host an Industry day specifically geared for FSC 4920.   The Industry Day is tentatively scheduled for the 27 and 28 January 2004.  Your response to these questions will be critical in determining how we can best formulate the commodity groupings.  Your responses will also assist us in setting up individual breakout sessions in order to achieve more meaningful discussions.   WHILE THE QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN PROVIDE BELOW FOR YOUR REVIEW, PLEASE COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE THROUGH OUR WEB SITE ESTABLISHED AS http://www.robins.af.mil/logistics/PSCM/survey/index.asp NOT LATER THAN 9 JAN 04.  THE WEBSITE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER 31 DEC 03.   We would greatly appreciate and encourage a response before the 9 Jan 04 deadline date.


 	Industry Day Questionnaire 4920 Purchasing and Supply Chain ManagementPathfinders	

The Purchasing and Supply Chain Management Pathfinders are part of the Air Force transformation process to discover and implement industry best practices within the Air Force.  We are trying to establish a better understanding of the commercial marketplace and business practices to enter into strategic partnerships with industry.  This questionnaire is a way to acquire knowledge of the business climate and investigate new ways to do business.  These questions require more than a yes or no answer and your comments can be provided as an attachment.  All replies will be kept confidential and will not be shared with others outside the government.

The following goals are at the heart of the transformation effort:

20% INCREASE IN AIRCRAFT AVAILABILITY BY 2006

50% REDUCTION In Demand-To-Delivery CYCLE TIME

MBK Engineers of Sacramento staff includes an individual who was the primary individual responsible for the development of the outlet gate construction sequencing plans and the documentation to the Corps of Engineers 2001 Gate Size Decision Technical Me morandum report.   c.	To award to a firm other than MBK Engineers of Sacramento for this follow-on effort, would cause substantial loss of time and manpower to the Government due to unfamiliarity with all features of the project, and in particular, with the conduit liner des igns. 2.  Specialized experience and technical competence required: (1) Enlargement of outlet works for operating concrete gravity dams; (2) Excavation methods and procedures in un-reinforced mass concrete, both above ground and below water surface; (3) Internal  and external bulkhead designs solutions subjected to high hydrostatic head; (4) Internal and external load combinations for outlet structures subjected to high hydrostatic head and grout pressures; (5) Structural Engineering, registered to practice in the  appropriate professional field in the State of California.  The evaluation will consider education, certifications, training, registration, awards, overall and relevant experience, knowledge of Corps of Engineers dam criteria, and familiarization with all  features of the proposed project, the seismic evaluations to date, the proposed outlet gate and bulkhead gate designs, past performance with respect to quality of work and compliance with performance schedules, knowledge of slide gates of a size and subje ct to the seismic loading similar to the subject project, the capacity to perform the tasks on a continual basis within the specified performance period, and the experience of the individual on similar size projects.  An individual from the firm shall be e xpected to collocate within the offices of the Army Corps of Engineers in Sacramento, CA. 3. Submission Requirements:  Firms may provide qualification information for consideration in allowing the Contracting Officer to determine alternate sources for this specialized work.  The Contracting Officer has sole discretion in making a determination to solicit other sources based on the information provided as a result of this Notice of Intent.  Submittals, in the form of an SF 255 must discuss the qualifications of your firm in relation to each of the qualifications listed above.  Limit the submissio n of the SF255 to not more than 20 pages.  A separate announcement and request for qualifications may be issued should this Notice of Intent result in responses that would reveal a more qualified source. 4. The responses may be e-mailed, or mailed to the attention of Barbara Marshall, 1325 J Street, Eighth Floor (CT-A), Sacramento, California 95814, (916) 557-5178, e-mail:  barbara.a.marshall@usace.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Draft Section M of SCAR Program
<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command is issuing a solicitation for the procurement of SOF Combat Assault Rifles (SCAR). The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the joint USSOCOM SCAR requirement.  The following is a DRAFT version of Section "M" (Evaluation Factors for Award).  This is provided to Industry for information purposes.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will issue in Jan 2004 with closing on 18 June 2004.

DRAFT SECTION M
SECTION "M" – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD 




1.0  BASIS FOR AWARD

The government may award multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal in response to the solicitation provides the best value to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the major areas, listed in descending order of importance:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  The Technical and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than Price.  In evaluating proposals, the Government will make appropriate trade-offs when required and select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government.  Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offeror.

The Government may award a contract(s) on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  However, if considered necessary by the contracting officer, discussions will be conducted with only those offerors determined to have a reasonable chance for award.

The Evaluation will be done in two parts:  a Preliminary Evaluation and a Full Proposal Evaluation.  The Preliminary Evaluation is a pass/fail evaluation.  Proposals passing all of the criteria will move on to the Full  Proposal evaluation.  Those proposals not passing all the standards shall be eliminated from further consideration for award.

4.2	Past Performance Area
4.2.1	Performance risk considers those risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation requirements as indicated by the offeror's record of past/current performance on relevant contracts.   The PRAG evaluation will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor’s performance of an offeror and all subcontractors/team members.  Proposals shall be evaluated to determine if the contracts submitted for the prime and subcontractors/team members sources are current and relevant.   If no relevant historical or current data exists then the procedures of FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv) will apply.   The Government will evaluate the Proposal, Questionnaire Responses and data from outside sources considering the following aspects:  Cost/Schedule Planning & Control, Quality Assurance,  and Cooperation.   This includes the offeror's performance in cost, schedule, and the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's history for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction;; and generally, the offeror's businesslike concern for the interests of its customers.
4.2.2	The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether offerors have achieved their Small Business Subcontracting Plan goals and monetary targets on relevant contracts.    The evaluation will also take into account the offeror's actions taken to attempt to achieve those goals.
4.3	Price Area
4.3.1	Price will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness.  A total evaluated price for the maximum quantities over the entire length of contract performance will be determined utilizing price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).    Price reasonableness is a matter of the competitiveness of the Offeror's proposal, considering the price and evaluation criteria.  Competitiveness is not determined by a simple comparison with the prices proposed by the other offerors, but rather, involves making trade-offs among offers with varying degrees of advantageousness.  The total evaluated price integrated with other evaluation criteria could result in award to other than the offeror with the lowest evaluated price.
4.3.2	Although prices for technical data not-separately-priced is not required in Section B of the solicitation, DoD requires estimates of the prices of data in order to evaluate the cost to the Government of data items in terms of their management, product, or engineering value in accordance with DFARS 215.470.
4.3.3	In the event the Government requires other than cost and pricing data, it shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.
4.3.4	All proposals shall be evaluated for unbalanced pricing.  The Government may remove proposals with unbalanced pricing IAW FAR 15.404-1.
4.3.5	 Total Evaluated Price (TEP).  All CLINS proposed in Section B will be totaled and summarized for each year based on the known Government requirement for that period.  The total quantity will equal the maximum quantity for each item that may be purchased.  This is for evaluation purposes only; the Government is not obligated to purchase anything other then the stated minimum as set for in the solicitation. For example, CLIN 0002 has a stated quantity of 83, 988.  The government intent is to buy this amount over the eight-year ordering period.  The current  Government estimated yearly quantities will be multiplied by  the Offerors price for that year. All prices will be summed for a total CLIN price.  This procedure will be followed for all CLINs, which will be summed to arrive at the total evaluated price (TEP).     

All offerors are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov/ for release of the upcoming solicitation and any notices. Any questions may be directed in writing, to the following: pfender_j@crane.navy.mil or via facsimile to the attention of Mr. John Pfender at (812) 854-5198.

Once the Past/Current Performance Questionnaires have been completed by the POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be released to you, the Offeror.

(b)  The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the SCAR L/SCAR H. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications (e.g., the automobile industry's QS 9000, Sematech's SSQA, or ANSI/EIA-599). Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed.

4.3.2	Prices for technical data shall be “not separately priced” in accordance with the schedule, however, cost for each data submission shall be provided in the pricing volume for evaluation purposes.  
4.3.3	Cost and pricing data is not required IAW FAR 15.403, however, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to request other than cost and pricing data should it be necessary to allow the Government to make a fair and reasonable price determination. The Contractor shall explain any price anomalies (i.e.,  for example, range order pricing economies of scale differences). The price proposal shall include information on any significant contractor with whom the prime has teamed with or major subcontract with. Other than cost and pricing data may be required of the subcontractor, the same as above pertinent to the prime if the Contracting Officer determines the information is needed for a reasonable determination.  
4.3.4	If applicable, catalog pricing containing detailed price list for any scheduled item shall be furnished.  Explanations shall be provided for any differences between the published price list and the proposed.  The offeror shall explain the basis for any proposed inflation from year to year.
4.3.5	The proposal is presumed to represent an offeror’s best offer since the Government reserves the right to award without discussions. As such, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Any inconsistency whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price, should be explained in the proposal as price credibility rest with the offeror.  The Government may reject any and all offers if such an action is in the publics interest, accept other than the lowest price proposal and waive any informalities and minor irregularities in the received submittals.

<SUBJECT>A--FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES ANNOUNCEMENT:  EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE PROGRAM AO-4
<DESC>NASA'S Earth Science Enterprise plans to release an Earth System Science Program (ESSP) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) in the summer of 2004.  ESSP missions are intended to execute science investigations at the forefront of Earth System Science to secure answers to high priority Earth Science questions in the science focus areas described in our new Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) Strategy.  We strongly encourage you to read the new ESE Strategy accessible at www.earth.nasa.gov. NASA will invite both the U.S. and international science communities to participate in proposals for ESSP missions to be carried out as a result of this AO. As in the past, NASA plans to conduct a two-step proposal and evaluation process for this AO.  Step-One is primarily a science concept screening, with some assessment of the mission's technical risks.  At the end of Step-One, NASA will recommend that a limited number of highly rated investigations enter the Step-Two process and prepare full proposals.  We anticipate a 90-day response period for the Step-One proposals, with the announcement of recommendations to enter the Step-Two process in about February, 2005.	We anticipate a 120-day response period for the Step-Two proposals.  Announcement of awards is expected in the fall of 2005. Further details will be forthcoming over the next several months.

STATEMENT OF WORK
For MAPICS SM Software



1.	Introduction
1.1	Purpose
The purpose of this contract is to give WR-ALC/MAN the capability of reliably meeting quoted delivery dates to our customers thereby strengthening our position as a supplier, improving customer satisfaction and providing a strategic advantage to secure and expand future business.

1.2	Background
Since the early 1990s, WR-ALC/MAN has transformed our operations to better serve our customer's needs.  Part of this transformation included modifying an existing planning system and implementing the Theory of Constraints (TOC) production philosophy.  In 1999 we purchased Thru-Put Manufacturing software that was based on TOC principals.  We quickly realized that our existing planning system (D012) did not provide the minimum data that Thru-Put required.  At that point we put the Thru-Put project on hold until we could upgrade our planning system.

In March of 2003 the upgrade of D012 was completed and we made the decision to purchase new TOC scheduling software.  Since the time that we originally purchased the software it has changed to MAPICS SCM.  Robins AFB currently has a site license for the MAPICS SCM software but WR-ALC/MAN must purchase the latest version and renew the maintenance agreement.

1.3	Scope
The proposed contract will provide WR-ALC/MAN with the latest version of TOC software, installation, training, and software maintenance.  WR-ALC/MAN will provide a server dedicated to this application and installations will be performed on that server at Robins AFB.  WR-ALC will also provide training facilities in the vicinity of Robins AFB for required software/process familiarization.

2.	Contractor tasking/requirements
2.1	The contractor shall install all products that they ship in their licensed media for which Robins AFB has been licensed.  This will include only the MAPICS SCM 6.1 software and Customer Service Workbench (TPWeb) 6.1.  WR-ALC/MAN will provide a dedicated server with operating system as specified by the contractor.

2.2	The contractor shall install Internet Explorer 5.5 sp2 or higher.

2.3	The contractor shall verify the installations including the following tests.  If WR-ALC/MAN cannot produce the minimum required data files to perform the tests, the contractor shall provide a test database.

2.3.1	Verify that the ODBC connection is configured correctly.

2.3.2	Verify that DBUtil is able to build a Microsoft Access database.

2.3.3	Verify that the MAPICS' SCM synchronization engine is able to load data and generate schedules.

2.3.4	Verify that the Customer Service Workbench is configured correctly.

2.3.5	Verify that the Customer Service Workbench is accessible.

2.3.6	Verify that the MAPICS' SCM plant is able to start via Customer Service Workbench.

2.3.7	Verify that the Customer Service Workbench is able to load data and generate reports.

2.3.8	Create a test user via Customer Service Workbench

2.4	The contractor shall provide software maintenance through December 2005.

2.5	The contractor shall provide 20 to 24 hours of on-site classroom training to be delivered over a 3 to 4 day period to a class of approximately 18 to 24 employees.  The training facility, computers, projector, whiteboard and flip chart will be provided by WR-ALC/MAN.

2.6	The contractor shall provide to each student, copies of all slides and materials utilized in the training class.

2.7	The contractor shall provide an application consultant to work with individual departments to address issues and concerns and provide individualized instruction in their specific areas of responsibility.  Period of consultation shall be approximately 9 working days.

2.8	The contractor shall review the data mapping to enable WR-ALC/MAN to correctly write the interface program that downloads data from the host system.

2.9	The contractor shall conduct an assessment of current capabilities and readiness to assist WR-ALC/MAN in developing the implementation project.  Written recommendations for the implementation process based on observations and assessments shall be provided.

2.10	The contractor shall deliver software documentation to include the user's manual, concepts manual, database guide, and installation and configuration guide.

3.	Delivery schedule and period of performance
3.1 The contractor shall complete this effort no later than 4 months after receipt of order.

One of the critical contract management functions involves providing Government Contract Quality Assurance activities outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42 Contract Administration and Part 46 Quality Assurance.  Many of the activities outlined in the FAR require Government over-sight of the contractually performed inspections and tests.  One of the critical types of inspections and tests involve Nondestructive Testing (NDT).  Past practice was to certify and re-certify by examination, which was labor intensive and very expensive.  It is proposed that in the future Computer Based Training (CBT) be used to assist in NDT skills maintenance and to serve as a basis for demonstrating currency of skills (Certification Maintenance).  A commercially available CBT has been identified that incorporates many of the competencies that are necessary for DCMA’s personnel, but additional modules and tests need to be developed to tailor the product for our purposes.

b. Description: Technical and programming services are needed to develop additional modules to augment a commercial Computer Based Training application that will be used to support Nondestructive Testing certification maintenance for NDT Specialists (Level II).  Contractor will provide this CBT service on CDs (Compact Disks) and the final delivery will be two sets of CDs (one Master and one certified copy) from which DCMA will be able to make user copies (if necessary), and 85 re-usable training CDs that cannot be copied by users.  The software must work in the DCMA Microsoft Windows environment and must be compatible with Adobe Acrobat.

	c. Place of performance:  Contractor’s facility.

	d. Date of Delivery:  The expected date of delivery is no longer than six (6) months from date of
award.  Offerors should provide a delivery schedule that meets or exceeds the expected date of delivery.

e. No contractor travel.  There will be a post-award meeting with representatives from DCMA at the contractor’s facility.  Date TBD.

 
f.  Anticipated Contract Line Items are below:

	CLIN 0001	One (1) master CD set for CBT NDT certification.  Specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.

	CLIN 0002	One (1) certified copy CD set for CBT NDT certification.  This certified copy should allow DCMA to make user copies, if necessary.  Other specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.  

	CLIN 0003	Eighty-five (85) reusable training CD sets that can not be copied.  Specific details of this deliverable are discussed in paragraphs g and h.

	CLIN 0004	Progress Reports every two months.  This CLIN will not be separately priced.

	One payment will be made when all CLINs have been delivered.

	g.	 Needs/Deliverable:   

1) Progress reports at intervals not to exceed two month on product development reflecting milestone accomplishment for each deliverable with drafts.  These reports will not be separately priced under this purchase and or delivery order.  Any cost should be prorated under CLINS 0001 through 0003 prices.

2) A statement in the CBT introduction prior to the training portion that indicates the practices demonstrated in the CBT are acceptable in many industries, but some of the practices may not be acceptable based on specific contractual requirements.  DCMA’s technical personnel must review the contractual and technical requirements to determine the specific contractual requirements and allowable practices.

3) Material must cover both Types and all Methods of Liquid Penetrant techniques commonly used by all of the military services, including water washable fluorescent, fluorescent post emulsified lipophilic, fluorescent post emulsified hydrophilic (including high sensitivity penetrants and scrubber type emulsifiers), fluorescent solvent removed, and visible dye solvent removed (showing high temperature inspection of weldments, etc.).  Other areas that must be covered are all developer forms (dry powder, water suspendable, water soluble, and non-aqueous for both Type I and Type II materials), removal and removers, pre and post cleaning methods, complete processing parameters (concentrations, application methods, dwell times, drying times, temperatures, controls, calibrations, necessary equipment (and how to use it), lighting requirements), accept/reject criteria, inspections, evaluations, procedures, surface treatments & coatings, surface preparations, health hazards, new vs. used materials, and materials/practice limitations.  Quality control provisions are to be covered, examples are: system performance, system checks, brightness and visibility, penetrant removability & sensitivity, emulsifier removability, equipment & material checks (ovens, meters, black & white lights, water temperatures & pressures, penetrant material & developer contaminations, etc.), known defect standards, and markings & symbols identifying penetrant inspection.  Material will cover True, False and Non-Relevant Indications.  This information is to be provided in videos, pictures, text and audio format on the CDs.

4) A specific test question bank based on a pool of questions provided by DCMA that is capable of randomly generating 30 question tests.  The questions within the bank must be consistent with the guidelines of SNT-TC-1A.  Data bank test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).
 
5) A general test question bank based on a general test pool of questions provided by DCMA that is capable of randomly generating 40 question tests.  The question bank must be consistent with the guidelines of SNT-TC-1A.  Data bank test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).

6) A practical examination bank that will consist of videotaped scenarios of penetrant inspections and system evaluations covering material required in 0003.  The examination bank will contain at least 4 different scenarios each of the Types and Methods listed in 0003 - water washable fluorescent, fluorescent post emulsified lipophilic, fluorescent post emulsified hydrophilic (including high sensitivity penetrants and scrubbers), fluorescent solvent removed, and visible dye solvent removed and various developer forms (dry powder, water suspendable, water soluble, and non-aqueous for both Type I and Type II materials).  The scenarios should show operating, method & equipment problems, and processing errors which the students will have to identify.  Part of the practical exam will also cover defect identification of digitized pictures of defects found by liquid penetrant (examples are: cracks in welds, forgings and castings, seams, laps, delaminations, cold shuts, porosity of both welds and castings, grinding cracks, fatigue, stress corrosion, and etc).  DCMA’s NDT technical authority will provide assistance in development of the practical examination, and the weighting of the examination questions will be dictated by DCMA.  Practical test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature.  Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).

7) Add a CBT module that incorporates DCMA’s guidance on NDT as key processes, risk rating, supporting risk rational, and the use of appropriate risk handling tools.  This module will be suggestions of the likely activities used to proof the PT process, what typical activities would be accomplished when performing product audits, potential process measurement points, and suggestions on how to approach data collection and analysis for the PT process.  DCMA will write the content of this module.

8) A databank containing PDF files of Military/Government Specifications, Standards and Technical Publications on the subject of NDT.  DCMA will provide files.

9) Material should also include information on current industry manufacturing processes, production methods and types of discontinuities that may be expected (digitized video clips, audio, pictures, and diagrams of metal production & mills; casting, welding, metal forming, forging, etc).  Module should go into detail (show actual defect types) of Inherent Material Discontinuities (Wrought and Cast), Processing Discontinuities, and Service Discontinuities.

10) Correct errors and incorporate changes in the contractor’s current database at DCMA’s direction.
	
h. Government Furnished Materials: DCMA will provide data, electronic files, and information which are the property of the Government.  At completion of the contract, all materials provided are to be returned to DCMA, and the contractor shall not use electronic materials or any other materials provided by DCMA outside this effort.  The contractor shall not duplicate, copy, or otherwise reproduce any furnished materials for any purposes other than those necessary to perform the contract.  The contract award is expected to have a tailored clause to allow the contractor to sell the DCMA copy, at the same price as a commercial product without the DCMA materials, to other government agencies.

i. Contractor Supplied Documentation and Software: The contractor shall ensure that all deliverables are prepared in a clear and concise manner, properly formatted, spell checked, grammatically and technically correct.  The materials required by task 0001 shall be reviewed by DCMA and comments will be provided within 10 working days after submission.
